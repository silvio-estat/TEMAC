This enormous amount of energy consumption at the university need a huge effort to reduce it. Smart grid is among the efficient solution to save energy and balance supply and demand. For the same purpose, the National School of Applied Sciences of El Jadida-Morocco wants take advantage from smart grid to maintain the balance between energy production and consumption. Despite of all added value of this smart grid solution for the school, it has the issue of managing energy production surplus, because it cannot inject it into Moroccan electrical infrastructure neither store it using storage devices. So, to overcome this challenge the system need to predict electrical consumption to be able to produce exactly the same value. Recently, Big Data contributed very well in analysing electrical consumption data using many tools and advanced techniques. It process, interprets and analyzes huge quantity of data to make it more profitable and valuable. For that reason, the school will take refuge in Big data technology to implement a custom system to predict electrical energy consumption by analyze all factors that influence electrical energy use. In this paper, we propose a benchmark of the main Big Data architectures in the field and that will cover all electrical energy data processing from data collection, data storage, data analytic and data visualization. The aim of this benchmark is to choose the optimal architecture in term of fault tolerance, resource management, data storage and data modelling to forecast electricity consumption in educational institutions.","","978-1-7281-6175-4","10.1109/CloudTech49835.2020.9365912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9365912","Big Data architecture;Lambda architecture;SMACK architecture;Electrical forecasting;Smart grid","Data analysis;Memory;Computer architecture;Big Data;Benchmark testing;Smart grids;Resource management","","","","16","IEEE","2 Mar 2021","24-26 Nov. 2020","24-26 Nov. 2020","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study proposes an innovative and integrated framework for data ingestion in a data lake, addressing the challenges posed by heterogeneous data sources, formats, and metadata management. The framework comprises three novel modules: First Unified Data Integration Connectors (UDIC), which provide seamless connectivity and data retrieval capabilities from diverse sources including databases, data warehouses, file systems, cloud storage, and APIs; Second, Adaptive Data Variety Transformation (ADVT), a module that intelligently handles the transformation and processing of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data types, ensuring efficient ingestion into the data lake; and third, Intelligent Metadata Management (IMM), a module that captures, stores, and manages metadata associated with the ingested data, offering advanced search, discovery, and enrichment functionalities. Comparative study corroborates features offered by the service with existing data ingestion tools to evaluate the novelty and significance of the study. Performance validation shows varying ingestion latencies across different data types: approximately 148.1 microseconds per record for structured data, 234.2 microseconds per record for semi-structured data, 65.6 microseconds per kilobyte (KB) for video data, and 42.7 microseconds per KB for image data.

This study synthesizes a unified conceptual reference architecture with eight fundamental layers to provide a framework for comparative analysis. We document an imbalance in layer development: storage and processing receive comprehensive attention while querying, infrastructure management, and monitoring layers remain underdeveloped. Implementation approaches show distinct patterns in deployment strategies and data handling, with structured and semi-structured data well supported, whereas unstructured data integration presents ongoing challenges. Future research should focus on developing standardized modular frameworks, benchmarking methodologies, and integrating modern data lakehouse architectures to bridge the gap between theoretical proposals and production-ready systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3624558","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) (Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifier: 00x0ma614) for the Article Processing Charge; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11214321","Big data analytics (BDA);Industry 4.0;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);smart manufacturing;cyber-physical systems (CPS);data lake","Fourth Industrial Revolution;Manufacturing;Systematics;Computer architecture;Artificial intelligence;Pipelines;Industrial Internet of Things;Big Data applications;Computer science;Focusing","","","","86","CCBY","22 Oct 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To foster the reuse of processing steps, literature proposes to store data in different degrees of processing in addition to their raw format. To this end, data lakes are typically structured in zones. There exists various zone models, but they are varied, vague, and no assessments are given. It is unclear which of these zone models is applicable in a practical data lake implementation in enterprises. In this work, we assess existing zone models using requirements derived from multiple representative data analytics use cases of a real-world industry case. We identify the shortcomings of existing work and develop a zone reference model for enterprise-grade data lake management in a detailed manner.

Network traffic anomaly detection is an effective method to replace traditional methods.

In this article, we propose a streaming network framework for mobile big data, referred to as SNMDF, which provides massive data traffic collection, processing, analysis, and updating functions, to cope with the tremendous amount of data traffic. In particular, by analyzing the specific characteristics of anomaly traffic data from flow and user behavior, our proposed SNMDF demonstrates its capability to offer real data-based advice to address new challenges for future wireless networks from the viewpoints of operators.

Today this tactic has been adapted by malicious attackers to the digital world and evolved into ""stream poisoning"", in which corrupt or fallacious data is injected into a data lake, so as to corrupt the integrity of the information stored there. Numerous maritime surveillance systems nowadays rely on the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which is compulsory for vessels over 299 Gross Tones, for vessel tracking purposes. Ship AIS spoofing involves creating a nonexistent vessel or masquerading a vessel's true identity, resulting in hiding or transmitting false positional data, so that a vessel appears to behave legitimately, thus deceiving stakeholders and authorities. Due to the volume and velocity of data received traditional approaches fail to automatically detect these spoofing events in real time. We focus on an industrial use case of detecting spoofing events in AIS streams and validate our approach in real world conditions.","","978-1-5386-7518-2","10.1109/DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTec.2018.00139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512006","distributed stream processing;big data;AIS vessel monitoring;anomaly detection","Artificial intelligence;Real-time systems;Radar tracking;Trajectory;Distributed databases;Big Data;Surveillance","","26","","15","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","12-15 Aug. 2018","12-15 Aug. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"What Does “Real Time” Really Mean?","M. Kihn; A. C. Lin",NA; NA,"Customer 360: How Data, AI, and Trust Change Everything","","2025","","","99","105","Summary <p>Newer technologies, including CDPs and data warehouses, are putting more real‐time data into the hands of practitioners, who can use it to improve their service, chatbots, product recommendations, campaigns, analytics, and so on. Delivering in right‐time requires a strategic calculus of what the customer expects and a behind‐the‐scenes balance among systems, resources, and goals. A typical configuration—embraced by a number of enterprise CDPs—supports a real‐time process for some streaming data, data change actions, and flows, while also having a data lake or lake house where data are located for refinement, processing, and storage. Many CDPs maintain a subset of customer data in a so‐called “hot store” or in‐memory database. This can be called the real‐time profile. The purpose of this real‐time profile is to make certain frequently used or high‐value data available. A key use for these low‐latency data graphs is for AI and GenAI models.</p>","","9781394273638","10.1002/9781394308668.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10954382.pdf&bkn=10950212&pdfType=chapter","","Real-time systems;Hands;Electronic mail;Data warehouses;Costs;Chatbots;Airline industry;Social networking (online);Big Data applications;Artificial intelligence","","","","","","8 Apr 2025","","","Wiley","Wiley AI eBook Chapters"
"Building Privacy-Aware Data Pipelines: Balancing Scalability, Compliance, and Performance in Modern Data Architectures","G. R. Mittoor; P. Udayaraju; S. Putteti","The Wendy's Company, Dublin, Ohio, USA; Department of CSE, School of SEAS, SRM University - AP; Zoominfo Technologies, Bentonville, Arkansas, USA",2025 International Conference on Machine Learning and Autonomous Systems (ICMLAS),"25 Apr 2025","2025","","","951","957","In cloud computing, data is generated from various sources in different locations, such as database management systems, data streaming environments, and files, and is automatically transferred to a data lake. Managing that data in the data lake is a challenging problem that involves developing a scalable model to integrate, process, and move it from one source to another with optimized cost and performance. The earlier research used various optimisation, data management and processing tools, but their performance efficiency is poor. This paper has been motivated to improve the overall performance by implementing the Random Forest algorithm for an overview of the incoming data, which is passed into a cost-effective data pipeline that helps to ingest and process massive amounts of incoming data daily. It also involves Apache Spark cloud services integrating the data seamlessly to manage storage and processing. Based on the data privacy and governance policies the RF model monitors and secures sensitive data in the input dataset. The simulation output is obtained by executing the proposed model in the cloud Apache framework, and the efficiency is verified regarding execution time, response time for user query, and accuracy. It is also verified that the data transmission with the cost efficiency for the healthcare dataset simulated in the Spark, S3, and AWS lake provides an aware pipeline model. A large-scale healthcare dataset is used in the simulation to confirm the efficacy of the data pipelining model, and the data transmission rate, claims, and cost efficiency are verified.","","979-8-3315-0574-5","10.1109/ICMLAS64557.2025.10968671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10968671","Data Pipeline;Data Scalability;AWS;Apache Spark;Healthcare Data Pipelining","Radio frequency;Cloud computing;Analytical models;Costs;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Scalability;Medical services;Data models;Pipeline processing","","","","18","IEEE","25 Apr 2025","10-12 March 2025","10-12 March 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
