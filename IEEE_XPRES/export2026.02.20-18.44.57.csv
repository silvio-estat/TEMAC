Organizations will, in fact, improve their tactical and operational decisions by utilizing systems that can alert the organization to any critical situation in any of the business sectors and consolidate the corresponding real-time data on the spot. In this paper, we define a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for an event driven Web-based real-time decision support system (WB-RT-DSS) engine that can be available on the cloud for stakeholders to access and request a decision making support on demand. We extend the implementation of intensional XML (Active XML) framework to propose a metadata directory to dynamically extract real-time data from various internal and external data sources. The WB-RT-DSS governs data collection and exchange based on the concept of service-orientated data gathering via Web services as the Active XML-based metadata directory provides connection to the external data as a service (DaaS) and to the external models as software as a service (SaaS). For illustration, the issue of overcrowding in emergency departments is addressed from a technical perspective.","","978-1-5090-4642-3","10.1109/ICCNI.2017.8123819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8123819","Real-time decision support system (RT-DSS);Active XML-based metadata;data as a service (DaaS);software as a service (SaaS);Distributed Systems","Real-time systems;XML;Decision support systems;Decision making;Data integration;Data warehouses;Web services","","4","","24","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","29-31 Oct. 2017","29-31 Oct. 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a methodology to store and exchange intensional data (in AXML format) to activate and automate the integration of real-time data and updates.

This study proposes an innovative solution to this problem by designing a multi-layered, adaptive Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) comprising interacting large language model (LLM) agents. The proposed system performs semantic-level information retrieval using a BioBERT-based vector database, enhances information retrieval by accessing up-to-date medical resources via the web, and restructures outputs by activating an adaptive optimization loop in low-confidence situations. Through the structuring of clinical texts, cross-validation of symptom analyses with literature and internet sources, and collaborative data fusion among agents, the system integrates multi-source data and produces consistent decisions.

The research develops a Large Multimodal Approach for Intelligent Decision-Making in Manufacturing Transformation to resolve identified difficulties. The new framework unites DQN models with ERP and MES and PCS system data using sophisticated data fusion methods to present a modern manufacturing situation that maintains synchronized real-time control. A DQN model trained using historical production data generates optimal future decisions through its system while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) streamlines the data focus on essential features. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) makes strategic production goals part of decision-making processes and Model Predictive Control (MPC) allows instant modification of production parameters at runtime. Online Learning operates within the system to dynamically adapt production methods when facing changes in operating conditions. The proposed method outperforms Q-Learning, PPO, and standalone DQN according to performance tests through achieving cycle time of 96 along with maximum yield at 90% and a peak decision accuracy level of 90%.

The implementation of modern maintenance techniques results in multiple performance issues together with unanticipated equipment malfunctions and increasing operational costs for business operations. This research establishes an IoT-based predictive maintenance structure which encompasses GNN with optimized decision support systems features. Circular measurement using streaming operational data becomes possible after industrial machines receive IoT sensors through the implementation of the system. A Granger Causality-Inspired GNN model specially designed to handle this specific data type performs efficiently for detecting dependencies between machine components and delivering dependable failure predictions successfully. The predictive model shows better performance than traditional approaches because it builds failure identification through causal relationships. A Decision Support System (DSS) operates together with the framework to use predictive insights that help select proactive maintenance approaches which cut maintenance time and maximize resources. The efficiency of systems improves through big data analytics because it analyses significant industrial data to create flexible performance within various industrial applications. Experimental runs demonstrate that the deployed strategy enhances both accurate forecasts and decreases faulty indications thus enabling optimized maintenance program operations for better operational productivity and lower expenditure. The system integrates IoT technology with deep learning approaches together with decision intelligence to develop an Industry 4.0 suitable intelligent predictive maintenance program.

Due to the fact that decision support systems (DSS) combine data and knowledge from many domains and sources, analyze them, and store the results in the cloud to give the right users useful information to aid in decision-making, data is regarded as a core component in the design of DSS. Dealing with such enormous volumes of data results in increased mistakes, packet loss, and a high likelihood of data congestion, which is a drawback of traditional methods of storing massive amounts of data in the cloud. Therefore, before transferring data to decision support apps or sending it again to the cloud, processing, initializing, and preparing it in the fog computing environment is a necessary and appropriate option.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Cross-Attentive Autoencoder (CAA) framework for multimodal data fusion in IoV environments. Autoencoders compress and denoise input data, providing latent representations, while the cross-attention mechanism establishes inter-feature correlations by leveraging query, key, and value mappings across modalities. This enhances contextual feature alignment and improves fusion accuracy. Experiments conducted on the Kaggle Passive Vehicle dataset and car parts image dataset demonstrate a 35% reduction in data size, while maintaining robust feature representation. Visualization through heatmaps and latent embeddings confirms the interpretability of fused outputs.

To solve these problems, this paper proposes a data fusion method for integrated management and integration of equipment and facility data, business thematic data and real-time weather data by using artificial neural network to ensure unique data sources and unified data standards. After the railway data fusion is realized, the fused data is trained by the machine learning algorithm, and then a comprehensive railway portrait with multi-dimensional information is drawn. Using a comprehensive picture of the railway, railway decision-makers can make decisions according to this picture. The experimental results show that when the training sample size is 1e6, compared with the training decision provided by a single data source, the precision and recall of the training decision can be improved by about 20% by using multi-source data fusion.","","979-8-3503-7544-2","10.1109/ICDSCNC62492.2024.10939111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10939111","intelligent transportation;railway facilities and equipment;data fusion","Training;Rails;Smart cities;Soft sensors;Data integration;Transportation;Rail transportation;Real-time systems;Standards;Monitoring","","","","23","IEEE","1 Apr 2025","20-21 Sept. 2024","20-21 Sept. 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To handle resource-demanding DNN workloads, graphic processing units (GPUs) have been used as the main acceleration engine. Although much research has been conducted to algorithmically optimize the efficiency of applying DNN to applications such as object recognition, limited attention has been given to optimizing the execution of GPU-accelerated DNN workloads at the system level. In this paper, we propose S^3DNN, a system solution that optimizes the execution of DNN workloads on GPU in a real-time multi-tasking environment, which simultaneously optimizes the two (sometimes) conflicting goals of real-time correctness and throughput. S^3DNN contains a governor that selectively gathers system-wide DNN requests to perform smart data fusion, and a novel supervised streaming and scheduling framework that combines a deadline-aware scheduler with the concurrency-enabled CUDA stream technique. To simultaneously maximize concurrency-induced benefits and real-time performance, S^3DNN explores a rather interesting and unique characteristic of DNN workloads, where multiple layers of a DNN instance often exhibit a gradually decreased GPU resource utilization pattern. We have fully implemented S^3DNN in a GPU-accelerated system and have conducted extensive sets of experiments evaluating the efficacy of S^3DNN under a wide range of system and workload scenarios. The results show that S^3DNN significantly improves upon state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated DNN processing frameworks, e.g., up to 37% and over 40% improvements in real-time performance and throughput, respectively.","","978-1-5386-5295-4","10.1109/RTAS.2018.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8430082","GPU;GPGPU;DNN;Real time","Graphics processing units;Real-time systems;Kernel;Videos;Throughput;Object detection;Yarn","","62","","42","IEEE","9 Aug 2018","11-13 April 2018","11-13 April 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the established Markov Decision Process (MDP) model, the agent evaluates the confidence and status of sensor data in real time and autonomously decides the fusion timing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional fixed threshold and rule based baselines, reducing the average tracking error to 0.0886. This adaptive strategy offers a robust solution for real‑time, high‑precision information fusion in complex and dynamic operational scenarios.","2771-7372","979-8-3315-2672-6","10.1109/ICUS66297.2025.11295247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11295247","Reinforcement Learning;Multimodal Data Fusion;Self-Guidance Suppression;Dynamic Decision-Making","Adaptation models;Markov decision processes;Decision making;Data integration;Reinforcement learning;Data models;Real-time systems;Timing;Vehicle dynamics;Convergence","","","","18","IEEE","23 Dec 2025","18-19 Sept. 2025","18-19 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Companies that want to exploit the use of unstructured data in their decisionmaking processes find it a great challenge to exploit them due to the large amounts and forms that such form of data takes. This study presents a novel integration framework combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with advanced deep learning models-specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-to facilitate the incorporation of unstructured data into Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Unstructured data, due to its diverse formats and volume, poses challenges for traditional RDBMS, which are optimized for structured inputs. To address these limitations, this research develops a classification-driven model capable of automatically extracting and structuring data from scanned documents such as receipts and invoices. The hybrid CRNN-BiLSTM architecture significantly enhances recognition accuracy, increasing performance from 83.2 % to 94.6 %, with corresponding gains in precision, recall, and F1-Score. The model was validated through a rigorous data science methodology encompassing data collection, model training, testing, and evaluation.

By merging the ternary data, a variety of data (including humans’) can be quickly calculated to obtain better and faster decisions. In order to achieve automated fusion from ternary data, this paper proposes a method based on reinforcement learning: firstly, the domain ontology used for associating ternary data is reduced and tessellated (dimension reduction), and then the reinforcement learning model is used to form “the new ontology”. Compared with resource-intensive global calculations (which may cost a few days), the new method can complete the calculations in minutes.

The use of low-code applications, such as Oracle APEX, is increasingly integrated with streaming data pipelines, particularly as enterprise software applications mature to support real-time decision-making frameworks. There is, however, a critical challenge that enables the seamless bidirectional flow of structured data, due to underlying issues with field mapping, schema congruence, and high-rate noise thinning. This research proposes an AI architecture for Dynamic Data Mapping that relates Oracle APEX forms to streaming platforms, such as Apache Kafka, with semantic field alignment and adaptive noise filtering techniques. The proposed system acquires the structure and context of the source and target schemas and in turn, provides precise, real-time data flow. Field-level metadata tagging, combined with statistical noise nulling, increases mapping accuracy, while dynamic metadata-rich data processing further enhances it. Evaluative experiments performed with synthetic and application-specific datasets from the healthcare, retail and finance sectors yielded up to 91% precision in field matching and a 38% drop in mapping latency. A throughput invariance with over 5% lost packets under high-rate noise input conditions proved the system’s scalability and robustness.

Reducing false alarms and increasing diagnostic accuracy, an adaptive alert mechanism constantly modifies threshold values according to clinical risk categories and patient-specific health profiles. Computational efficiency is increased through cloud-edge integration, which guarantees scalability and low-latency analytics across hospital networks.

Multipurpose sensors installed at many locations in underground mining environment provide data about the safety, security and mine conditions in near realtime. However, it is more important to convert this data into strategic intelligence, which means the communication of the right information to the right people at the right time to enable them to make optimal and informed decisions on risk control and process optimization. The Sterkfontein caves is a world heritage site, and over the past few years, some deformation was recorded inside the caves. Possible reasons include urbanization in the surrounding area, illegal dolomite mining in the past, weathering, man-made archaeological activities and continuous pouring of polluted and acidic water into the caves system. Acid water has high potential to dissolve the sensitive dolomite, create new and enlarge existing rock cavities, which can destabilize rock formations. The Wits Mining Institute (WMI) has installed a geotechnical and geo-environmental wireless sensor network inside the caves for monitoring and to gain a better understanding of deformation in a cave system. In this research, data analytics and visualization concepts have been applied to the data collected from the sensors in order to identify the trends or patterns inside the caves. Several dashboards have been developed to analyze and visualize the ground movement, wind velocity, temperature, humidity and toxic gases (carbon monoxide) using Tableau code. The data from ground movement monitoring sensors placed at different locations can be analyzed and visualized in relation to each other and in different time steps (minutes to hours, daily, weekly, monthly and/or yearly basis).

To date, no review paper has quantitatively compared the real-time performance between different localisation techniques based on various hardware platforms and programming languages and analysed the relations among localisation methodologies, real-time performance and accuracy. Therefore, this paper discusses the state-of-the-art localisation techniques and analyses their overall performance in AV application. For further analysis, this paper firstly proposes a localisation algorithm operations capability (LAOC)-based equivalent comparison method to compare the relative computational complexity of different localisation techniques; then, it comprehensively discusses the relations among methodologies, computational complexity, and accuracy. Analysis results show that the computational complexity of localisation approaches differs by a maximum of about 107 times, whilst accuracy varies by about 100 times. Vision- and data fusion-based localisation techniques have about 2–5 times potential for improving accuracy compared with lidar-based localisation. Lidar- and vision-based localisation can reduce computational complexity by improving image registration method efficiency. Data fusion-based localisation can achieve better real-time performance compared with lidar- and vision-based localisation because each standalone sensor does not need to develop a complex algorithm to achieve its best localisation potential. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology can improve positioning robustness. Finally, the potential solutions and future orientations of AVs’ localisation based on the quantitative comparison results are discussed.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3077800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9435134","Autonomous vehicle;localisation;sensor fusion;real-time performance;computational complexity;vehicle-to-everything","Real-time systems;Robustness;Laser radar;Global Positioning System;Feature extraction;Roads;Decision making","","125","","152","IEEE","18 May 2021","July 2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such constraints cause poor decision making, poor stock control and insufficiency in regard to responsiveness to changing production requirements. To meet the issues described above, though, the application of Adaptive Zone-Aware IoT Mesh equipped with Autonomous Inventory Decision Agents (AZA-IMAD) can be proposed on this paper; it is a full edge-centric inventory control framework. AZA-IMAD implements the IoT sensor nodes in a truly dynamic form of zoning that are governed with autonomous decision agents that have the capability to perform real time sensor fusion, anomaly detection as well as reconstruction of replenishment at the edge itself. A zone-aware communication protocol will further ensure the vital changes will be transmitted to the network to reduce network congestion but a lightweight blockchain ledger will provide auditing to diverse changes that are decentralized as well as tamper-resistant and will not need web connectivity on an ongoing basis. The overall evaluation in a virtual smart manufacturing arrangement reveals AZA-IMAD achieves an desired inventory monitoring of an 91.75 that is above the conventional process of 65% - 85%. Also, specifically, the framework recognizes stock change at a rate of 93,90 and induces timely replenishment decision at 91 of the stock at 93% accuracy. In addition, AZA-IMAD saves on 38 percent of bandwidth in addition to activation response of decisions in milliseconds since the centralized processing bypasses are eliminated. AZA-IMAD introduces two core innovations: (1) a dynamic zoning mechanism that adapts sensor clusters based on real-time inventory density and flow, and (2) autonomous decision agents (AIDAs) operating at the network edge, enabling immediate anomaly detection and replenishment without central dependence. These innovations jointly deliver over 10% higher accuracy and 38% bandwidth savings compared to RFID-ERP systems.","","979-8-3315-7073-6","10.1109/IETACS68750.2025.11385738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11385738","Adaptive IoT Mesh;Real-Time Inventory Management;Edge AI Agents;Dynamic Inventory Zones;Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion;Blockchain Auditing;Smart Factories","Technological innovation;Accuracy;Image edge detection;Dynamics;Decision making;Inventory management;Real-time systems;Anomaly detection;Monitoring;Smart manufacturing","","","","13","IEEE","20 Feb 2026","6-8 Nov. 2025","6-8 Nov. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite these efforts, the country's health data governance remains fragmented, as several healthcare organizations operate under different ministries. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies in data exchange, outdated or inaccurate records, and limited ability to use the data for timely patient care.This research puts forward the use of blockchain as a solution for reinforcing governance structures, optimizing data management, and enabling interoperability across Thailand’s fragmented healthcare organizations. By leveraging blockchain’s decentralized architecture, tamper-evident record keeping, and permissioned transparency, the framework enables near real-time exchange of clinical data among authorized stakeholders while preserving patient consent and privacy. Improving the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of medical information is expected to support more precise diagnoses and interventions.

Within the field, autonomic nervous system responses have been studied extensively since they can be measured quickly and unobtrusively. However, despite a vast body of literature available on the subject, there is still no universally accepted set of rules that would translate physiological data to psychological states. This paper surveys the work performed on data fusion and system adaptation using autonomic nervous system responses in psychophysiology and physiological computing during the last ten years. First, five prerequisites for data fusion are examined: psychological model selection, training set preparation, feature extraction, normalization and dimension reduction.

It must clearly outline the research objectives, such as real-time health data integration, adaptive decision-making, and improved treatment personalization. The proposed methodology should describe the use of 6G-enabled ultra-reliable low-latency communication, AI models for digital twin construction, and secure data management frameworks. Improved diagnostic accuracy, fast response time to clinical emergencies, and improved resource allocation in healthcare systems were main outcomes that are presented in this abstract. The technical contributions of this work with the integration of AI, 6G, and digital twin technologies are highlighted in the end of this study, and this may support the next-generation intelligent healthcare solutions. For self-learning healthcare digital twin, a model that leverages 6G-enabled medical informatics, real-time data streams, and artificial intelligence (AI) analytics is presented in this study. This presented model may support in clinical diagnosis, and classifying damages earlier. A real-time updated digital copy of the patient was created by the suggested method by integrating multimodal data from various sources including imaging, vital signs, consumer electronic devices such as smartwatches, wearable sensor metrics, and electronic health records (EHRs). The patient physiological patterns and previous injury profiles are constantly learnt by the integration of digital twin and deep learning (DL) algorithms. This integration is effective in predicting the occurrence, kind, and severity of injuries and internal trauma, falls, cardiovascular events, and neurodegenerative insults. The digital twin and healthcare providers are connected seamlessly with 6G communication infrastructure, guaranteeing ultra-low latency and great dependability. This allows for pre-hospital and critical care settings to implement instantaneous feedback loops, as well as for remote diagnostics and adaptive clinical decision-making. From home health monitoring solutions to smartphones and wearables, consumer electronics are ubiquitous and serve as common data collectors, greatly increase access and enabling the instant collection of accurate data using a digital twin.

However, processing the huge amount of data captured by the limited lifetime biosensors and taking the right decisions when there is an emergency are major challenges in WBSNs. In this paper, we introduce a biosensor data management framework, starting from data collection to decision making.

This approach uses an early warning score system to optimize data transmission and estimates in real time the sensing frequency. Second, we present a data fusion model on the coordinator level using a decision matrix and fuzzy set theory. To evaluate our approach, we conducted multiple series of simulations on real sensor data. The results show that our approach reduces the amount of collected data, while maintaining data integrity.

To realize this aim we forward a Bayesian non-parametric Dirichlet Process (DP) decision-making approach for real-time monitoring of UPM process using the data gathered from multiple, heterogeneous sensors. The sensor signals are acquired under different experimental conditions from a UPM setup instrumented with a heterogeneous sensing array consisting of miniature tri-axis force, tri-axis vibration, and acoustic emission (AE) sensors mounted in close proximity to the cutting tool. We track the prominent nonlinear and non-Gaussian signal patterns evident in the experimentally acquired sensor data using an adaptive non-parametric DP modeling technique. A cohesive decision concerning the UPM process condition is made by developing a new supervised learning method, which integrates the DP-model state estimates with an evidence theoretic sensor data fusion method. Using this combined DP-evidence theoretic approach, UPM process drifts and anomalies, such as sudden changes in the depth of cut, feed rate, and spindle speed that deleteriously affect surface finish, and hence cause high yield losses, are detected and classified with over 90% accuracy (with ${<} 5\hbox{\%}$  standard deviation). We compared these results with popular classification techniques, e.g., naïve Bayes, self-organizing map, and support vector machine; these conventional techniques had classification accuracy in the range of 83%–88%. Consequently, this research makes the following practically relevant contributions: 1) real-time identification of the incipient UPM process anomalies from multiple sensors and 2) prescribing the optimal subset of sensors signals contingent to particular process anomalies.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2015.2447454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165687","Dirichlet process modeling;evidence theory;process monitoring;sensor fusion;ultraprecision machining","Monitoring;Surface treatment;Machining;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Real-time systems;Data integration","","40","","39","IEEE","23 Jul 2015","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The article delves into the methodology and a tool used for data-driven risk management, while also shedding light on the obstacles, including issues with data quality, regulatory compliance, and the need of a strong data infrastructure. We also showcase case studies of financial organisations that have successfully used big data analytics to decrease risks, along with future inventive potential. A key barrier in improving decision-making processes and decreasing the risk-profile of the financial industry has emerged with the integration of BDA into FRM.

This study delves into the topic of BDA and its potential applications in FRM, real-time decision-making, predictive analytics, and risk assessment. Regulatory compliance, analytics algorithm complexity, data quality and administration, and other challenges are among the many that arise when integrating BDA into existing FRM systems. Additionally, it is inherent to financial organisations to face challenges when attempting to use the vast amounts of data, structured and unstructured, generated across many platforms. This research highlights the need of building strong data governance systems and using creative analytical approaches to tackle problems. Financial institutions may get the most out of BDA if they follow these steps, which will help them reduce risk, plan ahead, and take advantage of possibilities in emerging markets.

Such conventional measuring methods reverse personal difference of reaction of the immune system and there is no real-time decision making system that is limiting to clinical application. In order to bridge these constraints, this proposes the Real-Time Vaccine Response Prediction System (RT-VRPS), the state-of art platform purposely aimed to predict personal vaccine response by integrating the most recent concepts: genomic and proteomic. RT-VRPS, which is constructed using next-generation sequencing technology and mass spectrometry based on high throughput, can deliver high context multi-omic immune signatures in a few hours upon receipt of sample. The data are developed with an elucidable machine learning model, and clinicians are able to examine the predictive data and base on data and make evidence-based, individualized choices. The adaptive learning engine in the platform keeps on updating itself, keeping new knowledge and enhancing the precision and reliability of its prognostic capability, making them more precise with time. It is deeply complimented with a clinician dashboard where one is able to readily gain insight in real time which can be utilized to mould and build a response-oriented and adaptive treatment planning. In large-scale empirical evaluations, RT-VRPS has proven far more effective than traditional, unimodal, and retrospective models with respect to predictive abilities, processing rapidity and dependability to confounding factors. Its high detailed and time sensitive perspective of immune reactions can allow clinicians to craft precision programs of vaccination individually and make all its precision programs much safer and effective in the treatment of the patients. Furthermore, its economic and immediate scalability during operations makes the dynamic clinical processes possible, which can be explained by the need to direct the clinical workforce responsiveness to the immunological requirements that are constantly colkning. According to a sense, RT-VRPS should be considered as an innovative initiative in the framework of creating tailored personal immunology, complete gaps in the links of the already applied approaches to immunization, and the enhancement of the overall efficiency of the general health community approach.","","979-8-3315-7073-6","10.1109/IETACS68750.2025.11385620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11385620","Vaccine Response Prediction;Genomics;Proteomics;AI;Precision Medicine;Multi-omics Integration;Real-Time Analytics","Adaptation models;Decision making;Transcriptomics;Proteomics;Predictive models;Real-time systems;Data models;Vaccines;Bioinformatics;Engines","","","","13","IEEE","20 Feb 2026","6-8 Nov. 2025","6-8 Nov. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transparency, trust, data security, and scalability are traditionally regarded as the major deficiencies of DSS models which may impede their efficacy in critical decision-making environments. Seamlessly integrating blockchain with AI-powered DSS can help with data integrity, as well as prevent manipulation and inconsistencies while improving trust with many different stakeholders, because all transactions on a blockchain are transparent immutable, owing to blockchain's decentralized ledger system. The paper investigates a hybrid Blockchain-AI framework that can overcome the main drawbacks of existing DSS systems. This means that AI predictive analytics and machine learning models can match massive datasets for decision making, while blockchain guarantees the integrity, traceability, and decentralization of the data's inputs and outputs. Smart contracts: automate decision processes & ensure tamper-proof execution for defined set of rules & policies In addition, blockchain consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-Stake, Byzantine Fault Tolerance) can facilitate transparency and verifiability, thus improving conflict-avoiding distributed decision-making. To enable privacy-preserving collaboration between organizations, we introduce a new Decentralized AI Decision Support System (Dai-DSS) framework that integrates federated learning and a distributed ledger. It enables real-time data sharing while preserving data sovereignty, which helps organizations comply with regulatory standards such as GDRP and HIPAA. We are also looking at various optimization techniques such as off-chain scaling solutions (sidechains, Layer-2 protocols, etc.) that improve system efficiency while still keeping the system decentralized. Our research shows that by comparing with the traditional DSS models, the Blockchain-AI integration strengthens system resilience, improves the elimination of single point failure and facilitates open, trustless decision-making processes. Practical applications and the benefits of the proposed model are demonstrated through case studies in healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. Lastly, we address the challenges including computational overhead, interoperability and regulatory challenges, and suggest future research avenues on AI-augmented consensus algorithms and quantum-resistant cryptography.

The challenge here is the limitations of the traditional systems in delivering fast, accurate, and comprehensive patient assessments. These challenges can be resolved through this study that proposes an innovative health monitoring system by incorporating IoT sensors along with Augmented Reality (AR) using the Unity 3D and the Vuforia Engine package.

Most of the existing remote sensing processing software adopts the traditional pixel-based classification method, but with the application of more and more high-resolution remote sensing satellites in recent years, the traditional methods can no longer meet the application requirements of high-spatial resolution RS images. In urban planning, it is required that not only the fused RS images have good visual and target classification effects, but also the corrected images have high accuracy. In this paper, a RS image data processing algorithm based on data fusion is proposed. With the help of image fusion technology, image interpretation technology and spatial analysis technology, the change information in the implementation of urban planning is extracted, thus providing technical support for the construction of urban planning model. The experimental results show that with the increase of the number of experiments, the accuracy of this algorithm is stable above 90%, and the real-time wavelength tends to be stable.

However, data fusion and analysis are made more difficult by the large-scale nature of smart city data. An improved method for big data analytics for smart cities is presented in this abstract, with a particular emphasis on the fusion and analysis of multimodal data. Integrating heterogeneous data from several sources, such as text, photos, videos, and sensor measurements, is known as multimodal data fusion. A more complete understanding of the city can be attained by merging these many data modalities. To establish a single representation for analysis, the fusion process uses feature extraction, data preprocessing, and integration techniques. There are several opportunities created by the analysis of multimodal data in smart cities. It makes it possible to find intricate patterns like social behavior, environmental pollution, and traffic congestion. Predictive models that foretell future occurrences and optimize resource allocation can be constructed by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques. Additionally, data analytics may support decision-making by giving city officials and urban planners up-to-the-minute information and practical advice. To create strong data analytics frameworks and integrate them into the architecture of smart cities, interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists, urban designers, subject matter experts, and policymakers is necessary.

This method integrates multisource sensory data to form an intelligent decision-making model that blends fuzzy logic with a probabilistic neural network, facilitating precise detection and optimal control of the chain tension states. Initially, sensors measuring force, displacement, and current are strategically placed at pivotal sections of the scraper conveyor to collect multifaceted data pertinent to chain tension. Subsequently, fuzzy logic is applied to perform feature extraction and synthesis of various data types, yielding a comprehensive tension assessment index. Building on this, probabilistic neural networks are utilized for intelligent recognition of chain tension conditions and prediction of future trends.

After flow batch fusion processing, it extracts risk features in dimensions such as price fluctuations, market power, and line safety, and constructs a standardized indicator system; Adopting a hierarchical visualization design (macro global meso correlation micro subject) to achieve intuitive presentation of risk information, and combining rule engines and machine learning models to form a dual driven warning mechanism. The experimental verification shows that the data processing delay and early warning response delay of the framework are respectively controlled within 3.2 seconds and 4.5 seconds. The identification accuracy rate of three typical risk scenarios is more than 89 %, and the operator's subjective score is more than 8.7 points, which is significantly better than the traditional system and the single model, and can provide effective technical support for the real-time operation decision-making of the power spot market.","","979-8-3315-2345-9","10.1109/ICEC2NT65402.2025.11380005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11380005","Electricity spot market;Internal operational risks;Visual monitoring;Early warning mechanism;Multi source data fusion;Indicator system","Visualization;Fluctuations;Electricity;Data visualization;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Delays;Safety;Monitoring","","","","10","IEEE","19 Feb 2026","3-4 Sept. 2025","3-4 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are models capable of integrating multiple modalities of information, enhancing the environmental perception capabilities of the IoV. GenAI can generate highly complex virtual driving scenarios, which are used to test and optimize intelligent driving algorithms, reducing the risks and costs of real-world road testing.

The approach uses an annotated dataset for semantic segmentation and high-resolution satellite images from the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center. On Google Colab with GPU acceleration, the model is trained and verified and then further improved for computational efficiency on a Mac M1 machine. Our results show an overall accuracy of 91.3%, a mean intersection over union of 82.5%, and an F1-score of 88.4%, demonstrating strong classification performance throughout a range of land cover types. The confusion matrix analysis highlights strong segmentation accuracy for water bodies (94.2%) and structures (92.4%). Considerable misclassification between roadways and unpaved terrain results from spectral similarities. Furthermore, the perclass Dice Coefficient analysis confirms that the model can efficiently discriminate intricate topographical patterns. Especially in fast-expanding areas such as Dubai, UAE, it provides a scalable solution for landslide susceptibility mapping, catastrophe risk management, and sustainable urban design. Future work will explore multisensor data fusion, real-time inference, and applying explainable artificial intelligence techniques to enhance model interpretability in dynamic terrain settings.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3578822","RUDN University Strategic Academic Leadership Program; Deanship of Scientific Research at Northern Border University, Arar, KSA(grant numbers:NBU-FPEJ-2025-2225-09); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11030867","Coastal monitoring;DeepLabV3+;geographic information systems (GISs);landslide susceptibility mapping;multisensor data fusion;remote sensing;semantic segmentation;urban resilience classification","Terrain factors;Deep learning;Accuracy;MCDM;Data models;Semantic segmentation;Sea measurements;Risk management;Remote sensing;Satellite images","","2","","67","CCBY","11 Jun 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In safety-critical sectors, maintaining situational awareness is essential for performance and error prevention. Situational awareness (SAW) is crucial for the success of activities in many different domains, such as surveillance, humanitarian aid, and search and rescue efforts. SAW is however susceptible to enemy attacks. By giving users enhanced coverage, it increases survivability and mission capability. Recently, Smart gadgets used data to address crisis scenarios and provide real-time tracking to protect law enforcement personnel out in the field. Despite these developments, it might be challenging for first responders to get a precise feel of their surroundings due to an abundance of field data. Security teams need to be able to quickly transform this data into actionable intelligence using a few instruments at their disposal, including body cameras, fingerprint scanners, and facial recognition software. Officers can cut through the noise to acquire actual real-time situational awareness by integrating heterogeneous information into a cohesive platform. Therefore, the proposed work examines potential mitigation measures while considering hostile threats and assaults against SAW systems. Additionally, information and alarms can be instantly sent between operators and field officers using vital interface features. The optimization of the AutoML system is proposed for fusion of sensor data. AutoML classification with Bayesian and ASHA (Asynchronous successive halving algorithm) is used for situational forecasting and decision-making awareness, IoT is used to monitor data gathered from Kaggle and sensor readings, while thingspeak cloud is used to monitor sensor output.","","978-1-6654-5627-2","10.1109/ICAIA57370.2023.10169306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10169306","Sensors;Thing speak;IoT;Cloud monitoring;situation awareness;Real-time tracking;AutoML","Surveillance;Decision making;Transforms;Sensor fusion;Real-time systems;Software;Classification algorithms","","1","","23","IEEE","6 Jul 2023","21-22 April 2023","21-22 April 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces the Self-Explaining Decision Architecture (SEDA) for ML-based decision-making systems capable of generating intuitive explanations for their decisions in real time.

Uses of machine-learning and deep-learning algorithms are proliferating in nearly every industry, and while some are focused specifically on parking, real-time video analytics solutions can provide higher efficiencies in identifying and recognizing available parking spaces across larger subdivisions, thereby presenting potential innovations to address the challenges that unregulated on-street parking creates. The proposed framework integrates a low-complexity K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model for parking slot recognition with edgebased camera systems placed throughout urban cores. By utilizing edge devices and processing live video streams, less bandwidth/network dependency and lower latencies for availability and responsiveness are available when compared to a cloud-based streaming application. In the proposed system, a battery of background-subtraction algorithms is employed in conjunction with temporal filtering methods that can be utilized to improve reliability, thereby minimizing false positives due to partial occlusion, pedestrians, or lighting variabilities. To guarantee functionality and reliability of the AI models, the training has included a diverse library of datasets encompassing a variety of weather conditions, angles, and types of vehicles. After recognition, and the availability coordinates collected and transmitted via recognized and standardized low-latency Internet of Things middleware, the availability data confirmed for each parking slot is indexed and mapped in a centralized controller. This enables real-time capabilities whereby the enduser can view all available parking locations via mobile/userfacing application, and API endpoints for third-party applications (e.g., Google Maps, in-car systems).","2769-2884","979-8-3315-5421-7","10.1109/ICRITO66076.2025.11241276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11241276","Smart parking;Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems;Intelligent Transportation Systems;Edge AI;Autonomous Decision-Making","Privacy;Filtering;Web services;Image edge detection;Decision making;Lighting;Edge AI;Nearest neighbor methods;Real-time systems;Reliability","","","","20","IEEE","27 Nov 2025","18-19 Sept. 2025","18-19 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complexity is due in part to the circuitous nature of fusing data from multiple sensor sources to provide a representation of the operational environment from which to redirect sensors for further information optimization and from which to base military operations.

Conventional ERP systems such as Oracle PeopleSoft are built for batch, transactional workload applications. These systems are not inherently designed to ingest continuous and high-velocity IoT stream data. This paper proposes a framework that leverages Oracle PeopleSoft Integration Broker Event Services to enable secure, scalable, event-driven updates from an edge gateway to core ERP modules.

The irrigation system is one of the most important components of a system of agriculture. The crop's productivity will be directly influenced by the efficiency and applicability of the irrigation system. Water scarcity is one of the greatest challenges for an irrigation system. The efficient use of land, water, and energy resources depends on Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart agriculture systems. In this article, a distributed data reduction and decision-making (DiDaReD) approach for IoT-based smart farming irrigation systems is proposed. The DiDaReD approach is implemented on two levels: sensor devices and edge gateway. At the sensor device level, we implemented a lightweight scoring method for removing the redundant collected soil moisture readings before sending them to the edge gateway. At the edge of the gateway, a voting technique is applied to the scores of received readings from sensor devices to produce a decision regarding irrigation of the monitored farming field according to the soil moisture state of this field. Finally, since the DiDaReD approach is periodic and works in real-time, we implement a decision reduction algorithm to prevent sending the same decision notifications to the actuator, thus saving the energy of the IoT network. Several experiments are implemented using real sensed data from the farming field, and the conducted results show that the proposed DiDaReD outperforms other methods in terms of data reduction ratio, number of sent readings, energy consumption, network lifetime, data integrity, decisions, and total energy consumed by the edge-gateway node.","2473-7674","979-8-3503-3509-5","10.1109/ICCCNT56998.2023.10307568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10307568","smart irrigation;data reduction;decision making;IoT;smart agriculture","Smart agriculture;Irrigation;Soil moisture;Decision making;Sociology;Distributed databases;Logic gates","","","","23","IEEE","23 Nov 2023","6-8 July 2023","6-8 July 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional methods for predicting water quality often lack accuracy and robustness due to limitations in data availability and model complexity. This study presents a novel approach to predicting water potability by developing an advanced ensemble model and an interactive visualization dashboard. A comprehensive dataset of water quality parameters was collected and preprocessed to ensure data integrity. An ensemble model combining Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost and Neural Networks was constructed, leveraging the strengths of each algorithm to enhance predictive accuracy. The model achieved an accuracy of 96.7%, precision of 96.7%, recall of 100%, and F1-score of 98.4%, outperforming existing models in the literature. Furthermore, to address contemporary developments in the field of machine learning, a transformer-based model was introduced alongside the existing ensemble and neural network approaches. This integration reflects the heightened prominence of deep learning methods and aligns the study’s methodology with cutting-edge research trends. Cross-validation results further confirmed the model’s robustness, with a mean accuracy of 96.9% and a low standard deviation. The interactive Water Quality Predictive Dashboard developed using the Dash framework, provides real-time predictions and visualizations, allowing stakeholders to input new data and receive immediate feedback on water potability. This tool enhances user accessibility and supports informed decision-making. The study highlights the advantages of the ensemble approach in improving prediction accuracy and reliability, though it also acknowledges the complexity and data dependency challenges.

Digital Twin Simulation (DTS) enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and strategic planning for effective disaster mitigation. Traditional disaster management approaches often suffer from delayed decision-making, lack of real-time data integration, and inefficient resource allocation. These limitations hinder swift response efforts, exacerbating the impact of disasters on affected communities. To address these challenges, we propose an AI-Driven Digital Twin Simulation (AI-DTS) framework for real-time disaster response and resource allocation. AI-DTS integrates artificial intelligence, digital twins, and the Metaverse to create a dynamic, data- driven environment for monitoring disasters, predicting their impact, and optimizing emergency response strategies. The framework utilizes AI-driven predictive analytics, IoT-enabled real-time data collection, and immersive simulations to enhance situational awareness. The proposed method allows crisis responders, policymakers, and emergency management teams to collaborate within an interactive digital space, ensuring efficient decision-making.

One of the key ingredients in the development is the implementation of multi-sensorial networks capable of aggregating different data streams, from passing cars and noise levels, to pollution indicators and human mobility trends. Yet the complexity, scale, and diversity of these data pose significant challenges to conventional analytic techniques. In this research, we propose a cutting-edge deep learning architecture: Spatiotemporal Convolutional Networks (ST-CNs) for urban activity recognition, analysis and prediction using both spatial and temporal data characteristic. In this work, the ST-CN proposed framework employs a hybrid architecture of 2D CNNs for spatial feature extraction and 3D or temporal convolutional layers to capture time-dependent patterns. This two-aspect ability helps this model to identify moving events including pedestrian flows, emergency incidents, and traffic congestion occurring them space-time dimension. Networked with a wide range of sensor inputs from CCTV video feeds, IoT devices and mobile geolocation data, the network learns patterns from real-world multisensory urban environments in real-time. The model employs attention mechanisms and dimensionality reduction layers to alleviate computational complexity in managing sensor data at large scales while still maintaining high-resolution spatial features. Central to this work is unsupervised and semi-supervised domain transfer of the model, trained on various urban datasets including images, and different smart city infrastructure. Data fusion approaches are mainly employed to unify different sensor measurements (e.g., noise, delay and data sparseness) into a coherent decision making logic. Our experimental studies on real-world smart city datasets attest to the accuracy of our event detection, anomaly detection, and urban condition forecasting abilities (e.g., predicting traffic congestion and public risks). Performance is measured in terms of system accuracy as well as the speed, and when compared to the conventional CNN or RNN models our ST-CN model has demonstrated a superior performance. Our system is able to scale and generalize to other city environments with little need for re-training, ensuring an optimal allocation of resources and enabling real-time agile urban management. The use of deep learning gives us an exciting glimpse into the future: a responsive and data-driven urban ecosystem. Spatiotemporal intelligence in smart cities not only make urban situation awareness can be strengthened, but also support proactive governance, sustainable planning and improving quality of urban living.","","979-8-3315-6815-3","10.1109/ICFT66708.2025.11336534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11336534","Deep Learning;Smart Cities;Spatiotemporal Convolutional Networks;Multisensory Data Fusion;Urban Activity Recognition;Real-Time Monitoring;Sensor Networks;Urban Analytics","Deep learning;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Data integration;Real-time systems;Data models;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Pollution measurement;Convolutional neural networks;Traffic congestion","","","","15","IEEE","21 Jan 2026","7-8 Nov. 2025","7-8 Nov. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work improves trade-off between the freshness and fidelity of status updates at periodical decision epochs by selecting appropriate transmission time and quantization precision. Specifically, the age of information (AoI) metric is used to assess data freshness, while distortion that consists of both static and dynamic parts is used to characterize the fidelity of status updates. We first formulate a joint AoI and distortion optimization problem. Then, the optimal transmission time and quantization precision are theoretically analyzed.

Thermal cameras first capture IR images, which are then denoised, aligned, and resized before being processed by an 8-bit–quantized YOLOv11x model on NVIDIA Jetson hardware. This model accurately detects hostile military personnel in darkness, smoke, and adverse weather. The detection outputs are georeferenced and passed to an Agent AI module that uses reinforcement learning for real time threat detection, prioritization, and mission adaptation, thereby reducing operator workload and response time. At the same time, every image, detection, and AI decision is immutably recorded on Pure Chain, a lightweight blockchain employing Smart Auto Mining Plus(SAM+) and a Proof of Authority and Association (PoA2) consensus mechanism to secure peer-to-peer transactions in under three seconds. Performance evaluation confirms robust detection, low latency decision making, and tamper-proof data integrity.

The process of discovering and clearing ordnance involving landmines using human or animal forces presents extreme risks and demands a considerable labour force and time. Landmines are made from a variety of materials, including wood, glass, metal, and plastic, and they vary in size. To improve detection accuracy, multiple sensors with different capabilities can be used simultaneously, allowing for data fusion and more informed decision-making. The use of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with diverse remote sensing technologies offers a safe and efficient means of accelerating humanitarian demining operations. In this study, two integrated remote sensing modalities - Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) and magnetometers - are mounted on an advanced autonomous UAV to enhance detection probability and reduce false alarm rates. A custom Android-based tablet application is used to analyse the fused data in real time.

AR-enabled productive spaces can connect virtual overlays with the user's real-world, overlaying relevant data directly into his/her field of view. But this smooth transition also presents major cybersecurity issues. Real-time AR data overlays that, in many scenarios, are wirelessly transmitted, are vulnerable to interception, manipulation and injection of adverse content by adversaries. These kinds of cyberattacks can result in data leaks, disruption to operations, or even health risks for personnel in mission-critical situations like factory floors, medical procedures or out in the field. A multitiered cybersecurity framework for safeguarding AR- enabled spaces from interception and tampering of real-time data overlays is proposed in this research. The cure uses encrypted data streaming, zero-trust network architecture, AI-based anomaly detection and handshake authentication. Encrypted communication paths, seeded with dynamic key exchange, guarantee against undue eavesdropping of transmitted overlays. Zero-trust guidelines allow for the dynamic authentication of both devices and users to protect against unauthorized access of AR streams AI-driven threat detection observes the flow of data in real-time to identify any abnormal behavior patterns, such as surprising overlay changes or suspicious traffic. Integrity verification mechanisms, deployed at the edge, cross-verify the data authenticity prior to rendering it on the user code naveen s3 s device, preventing the delivery of tampered content. The proposed framework was tested with a simulated AR environment which fuses collaborative CAD modelling, live IoT sensor feed and remote expert facility. Several hypothetical cyberattack models including the man-in-the- middle (MITM) interception, overlay injection and replay attacks were reproduced. The experimental results show that the proposed CGI can detect overlay manipulation attacks with a detection rate of 94.5% and prevent interception 98% of times with no visible delay in rendering ($<30 ~\text{ms}$). This research reveals the pressing requirement for strong cyber- defense within AR work environments, which are quickly expanding from niche applications to enterprise standards. This approach can protect real-time AR content against disclosure, alteration, and denial of service-related threats on both network level and application level. Results lay a foundation for the development of secure, scalable strategies for performing AR deployments that maintain the rich, high-speed experience that is necessary for effective workspace operations and protect against emerging cyber threats.","","979-8-3315-5641-9","10.1109/ICDISS68238.2025.11320666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11320666","Real-Time Data Overlay Protection;Augmented Reality Security;Zero-Trust Architecture;Data Integrity Verification;AR Workspace Cybersecurity","Solid modeling;Mission critical systems;Authentication;Rendering (computer graphics);Real-time systems;Cryptography;Computer crime;Artificial intelligence;Augmented reality;Eavesdropping","","","","16","IEEE","12 Jan 2026","14-15 Nov. 2025","14-15 Nov. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the construction of a HI for online machine condition monitoring and degradation assessment is still challenging. First, most existing degradation models need historical abnormal and faulty data for training. Second, weights/parameters of degradation modeling lack physical interpretation for automatically picking up informative sensors and locating fault-related information. Third, a single HI rather than a composite HI is normally constructed to reflect partial degradation information. To address these problems and challenges, an optimal squared Wald statistics-based methodology for on-line machine condition monitoring and degradation assessment is proposed. To begin with, based on the Wald test, Wald mean and trend statistics are respectively introduced to detect whether the mean and degradation trending of a HI are statistically changed. Then, by using an integration of two squared Wald statistics constructed from the Wald mean and trend statistics as a new composite objective function, a degradation assessment statistic optimization model is innovatively proposed to generate an optimal composite HI with physically interpretable fusion weights, which can locate informative frequency bands for nonprocess data in the frequency domain and can automatically pick up informative sensors for process data. Finally, an on-line version of the proposed optimal squared Wald statistics-based methodology is developed to be independent of historically abnormal and faulty data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by two significantly different process and nonprocess run-to-failure datasets. Results show that the proposed methodology is capable of promptly detecting incipient faults, and optimal fusion weights can identify informative sensors for process data and informative frequency bands for nonprocess data.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3291743","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3402100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51975355); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172042","Composite health index (HI);data fusion;degradation modeling;interpretable model weights;optimization;Wald statistic","Sensors;Degradation;Sensor fusion;Condition monitoring;Monitoring;Data integration;Data models","","1","","25","IEEE","3 Jul 2023","2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This letter marks the inaugural report from a series of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) Trustworthy IoV Workshops, which aim to address these issues. In these workshops, we explore the concept of a decentralized IoV (DeIoV), underpinned by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), to facilitate trustworthy interactions between vehicles and other entities. The proposed DeIoV is structured in two layers: the local DAO layer and the global DAO layer. This dual-layer architecture distinguishes between real-time and non-real-time decision-making tasks, aiding in their efficient completion. To ensure data security, integrity, and accuracy, we employ blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow for mutual verification among adjacent members and utilize encryption algorithms. A reputation value-based voting mechanism for decision-making is also introduced, which helps prevent the monopolization of power through token-based systems, a common issue in traditional DAOs.

Maps help prioritize where assets are deployed in disasters in efficient ways and are important for compiling data layers about normal environmental risk inequalities of various indicators in general, to locate geographically the most vulnerable populations in order to improve their lives. Central to both kinds of mapping efforts are accessibility and clarity of information, whether in plotting a rapidly evolving natural or human-made hazard in a disaster zone, or for sharing with first responders, or for ongoing daily awareness and thus better administration about regular environmental risk in national populations. The RiskRadar platform prototype improves five shortcomings found regularly in other platforms for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and has more comprehensive data integration and visualization tools with its unique data indexes to enhance disaster preparedness and response. By integrating diverse environmental and urban data sets, RiskRadar shows different kinds of risk easily. From this, it facilitates informed decision-making on priorities and timely actions, while aiding more coordinated awareness and thus coordinated response to risk. This paper examines functionalities of a prototype platform for how it bolsters disaster resilience particularly in contexts desired by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). With a user-friendly interface, RiskRadar lets stakeholders, first responders, and the public at large access the same critical information.

Precise and robust HMIP with low computational resources remains a challenge due to the stochastic nature of hand motion and the diversity of HRC tasks. This paper proposes a framework that combines hand trajectories and gaze data to foster robust, real-time HMIP with minimal to no training. A novel 3D vector field method is introduced for hand trajectory representation, leveraging minimum jerk trajectory predictions to discern potential hand motion endpoints. This is statistically combined with gaze fixation data using a weighted Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Acknowledging the potential variances in saccadic eye motion due to factors like fatigue or inattentiveness, we incorporate stationary gaze entropy to gauge visual concentration, thereby adjusting the contribution of gaze fixation to the HMIP. Empirical experiments substantiate that the proposed framework robustly predicts intended endpoints of hand motion before at least 50% of the trajectory is completed. It also successfully exploits gaze fixations when the human operator is attentive and mitigates its influence when the operator loses focus. A real-time implementation in a construction HRC scenario (collaborative tiling) showcases the intuitive nature and potential efficiency gains to be leveraged by introducing the proposed HMIP into HRC contexts.

However, achieving seamless integration across these technologies remains a major challenge due to persistent issues of data interoperability, consistency, collaboration, and intelligent data exchange throughout the product lifecycle. Moreover, the limited intelligence at the machine level and the fragmentation of data across heterogeneous systems hinder the realization of fully connected, autonomous manufacturing environments. To address these challenges, this work conducts a comprehensive review of the literature on DTh and DTw technologies, focusing on their application in additive manufacturing (AM) and their alignment with international standards for data exchange and system interoperability. Building on this foundation, a unified digital ecosystem for contextualized intelligence is proposed, aiming to integrate DTh and DTw through standardized, semantically rich, and interoperable data flows. Furthermore, a standards-based DTh–DTw framework is presented, leveraging key industrial standards, including STEP/STEP-NC, MTConnect, QIF, OPC UA, MQTT, and ISO 23247, to ensure traceability, real-time synchronization, and data-driven decision-making across the AM lifecycle. Two implementation scenarios validate the proposed approach: (i) an FDM-based AM process using STEP-NC and MTConnect for integrated process planning and monitoring, and (ii) a robotic wire-based LMD cell featuring three DTw implementations compliant with ISO 23247 for real-time simulation, predictive maintenance, and process visualization. These implementations demonstrate the feasibility of constructing interoperable, data-centric manufacturing workflows using open standards. The results underscore the potential of the proposed ecosystem to enhance interoperability, data consistency, and intelligence across manufacturing processes, while also revealing current limitations in AM-specific standardization and cross-platform integration. Although focused on AM, the framework is inherently extensible to other manufacturing domains, paving the way toward standards-driven, intelligent, and generative manufacturing ecosystems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3641205","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Foundation for Research Support of the Federal District (FAPDF); Deanship of Research and Innovation/University of Brasilia (DPI/UnB); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11282428","Additive manufacturing;digital thread;digital twin;STEP-NC;ISO 23247;ISO 10303-238;data integration;interoperability;industry 4.0;laser metal deposition","Manufacturing;Three-dimensional printing;Ecosystems;Fourth Industrial Revolution;ISO Standards;Data models;Solid modeling;Production;Interoperability;Digital twins","","","","129","CCBY","8 Dec 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This research introduces a cohesive data-driven healthcare platform that leverages heterogeneous healthcare data streams such as electronic health records (EHRs), imaging, biometric sensors, and administrative workflows to improve diagnostic accuracy and optimize hospital workflows. The system proposed utilizes statistical learning models for early disease detection, risk stratification, and real-time patient monitoring, while distributed big data platforms like Apache Spark provide scalable processing, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics. Experimental validation with retrospective hospital records and simulated sensor data showed a 25.8 % gain in diagnostic accuracy, a reduction in average emergency department wait times by 18.2 %, and a 31.4 % boost in bed occupancy efficiency over current systems. Predictive warning for clinical deterioration attained an accuracy of 0.87, recall of 0.91, and a general classification accuracy of 93.2 %, further emphasizing the system's capability to provide actionable insights in high-stakes settings.

In such situations, the use of multiple modalities is needed. Multimodal fusion approaches have been successful in other domains, such as wireless-sensor networks, in addressing single-sensor weaknesses and improving information quality/accuracy.

Current disaster management systems often rely on unimodal data streams and centralized processing, which limit prediction accuracy and response speed. This paper proposes an AI-powered multimodal disaster prediction and response system that integrates remote sensing imagery, ground-based IoT sensor data, and social media feeds for real-time situational awareness. The system leverages a hybrid deep learning framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for satellite image interpretation, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal event forecasting, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for extracting early warning signals from textual data. Edge analytics is employed to enable low-latency, localized decision-making, reducing dependency on cloud-only infrastructures. A case study using publicly available disaster datasets demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy, lead time, and response coordination compared to traditional unimodal approaches. The results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to support smart disaster-resilient cities and humanitarian organizations by enabling faster, more reliable, and resource-efficient disaster management.","","979-8-3315-9573-9","10.1109/ICONAT66879.2025.11362424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11362424","Disaster Prediction;Remote Sensing;Edge Analytics;Multimodal Data Fusion;Humanitarian Technology","Accuracy;Wildfires;Social networking (online);Disasters;Urban areas;Disaster management;Natural language processing;Time factors;Remote sensing;Long short term memory","","","","35","IEEE","30 Jan 2026","19-21 Sept. 2025","19-21 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, the digital economy is experiencing a growing concern originating from increasing financial losses based on fraudulent activities at retail POS systems. This paper presents FraudFusion, a novel multi-modal ensemble learning explainable framework designed to enhance fraud detection in retail POS environments. It fuses transactional, device telemetry, and behavioral context into a unified vector that ensures defense against a wide range of fraudulent attempts. A novel Context-Aware Dynamic Modality Weighting (CADMW) mechanism has been introduced in this framework that dynamically adjusts learner contributions per transaction based on real-time modality relevance. Besides, a unique combination of context-aware pruning and quantization further optimizes the system response and resource utilization for edge devices, making it an appropriate solution for resource-constrained environments. The application of the FraudFusion framework on real-world retail transactions demonstrates an impressive fraudulent activity detection accuracy of 94.9%. The precision, recall, and F1-score values are 94.2%, 94.8%, and 94.5%, respectively. With 41.9% CPU resources and 148 MB RAM, it responds in real-time with only 72.6 ms latency. Moreover, it demonstrates resilience to a wide range of adversarial attacks through Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples. Most importantly, it is an explainable system, which is essential for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the financial sector. In a nutshell, the FraudFusion framework is an interpretable, scalable, and optimized solution equipped with advanced capabilities to detect next-generation fraudulent activities at retail POS systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2026.3655398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11357914","Fraud detection;multi-modal learning;point-of-sale systems;anomaly detection;ensemble learning;context-aware systems;edge computing;explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);adversarial robustness;out-of-distribution detection;retail cybersecurity;real-time analytics","Fraud;Real-time systems;Image edge detection;Anomaly detection;Telemetry;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence;Robustness;Ensemble learning;Finance","","","","58","CCBY","19 Jan 2026","2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a granular decision making architecture that can be viewed as a tiered wake up circuitry. This module, in combination with a low-power microcontroller, enables an ultra low-power architecture. The significant power saving is achieved by performing a preliminary ultra low-power signal processing and hence, keeping the microcontroller off when the incoming signal is not of interest. The preliminary signal processing is performed by a set of special purpose functional units, also called screening blocks, that implements template matching functions. We formulate and solve an optimization problem to select screening blocks such that the accuracy requirements of the signal processing are accommodated while the total power is minimized. Our experimental results on real data from wearable motion sensors show that the proposed algorithm achieves 65.2% energy saving while maintaining 92.7% sensitivity in recognizing human movements.","1545-3421","978-1-61284-326-1","10.1109/RTAS.2011.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5767146","Medical Embedded Systems;Body Sensor Networks;Signal Processing;Power Optimization","Sensors;Bismuth;Decision making;Signal resolution;Monitoring;Program processors","","5","","28","IEEE","12 May 2011","11-14 April 2011","11-14 April 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Robots should be able to carry out any assigned task autonomously, yet cooperate with other robots when allowed to by the environmental conditions. To enable this, there is a growing interest in robotic software solutions which are modular, scalable and easy to test. In this paper, we introduce iCADME, a novel autonomy architecture, which achieves such features thanks to a software eco-system which relies on a hierarchy of tasks, in charge of perception and decision-making, and of behaviour strategies, which act as the interface towards the robot lower level control architecture. The modularity and the attention to the system configuration are instrumental for the user to reuse the software and to expand the task portfolio. Thanks to the strong decoupling between perception/decision-making and action, achieved also with the design of an interface layer with the external middleware, iCADME can be easily integrated with various planning and control systems and with different middleware software. On top of that, a behaviour trees (BTs) mission management system is introduced. BTs enable the building of complex missions by assembling a portfolio of tasks, with features of high modularity and reactivity. All these iCADME's features were succesfully tested during MEDASWAN23 trial.

The proposed system integrates three core innovations: (i) federated learning to enable decentralized model training across siloed datasets without transmitting raw patient information, (ii) multimodal data fusion using transformer architectures to process electronic health records (EHRs), physiological sensor streams, and medical images, and (iii) explainable AI (XAI) modules that generate human-interpretable insights via attention maps and SHAP-based reasoning. HealthEdge-AI embeds differential privacy and homomorphic encryption within its communication protocols to achieve strong formal guarantees of security and confidentiality. Empirical validation was performed using three benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV, PhysioNet, and MedMNIST), targeting the diagnosis and risk stratification of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including cardiovascular conditions and diabetes. The framework consistently outperformed baseline centralized and federated models in terms of accuracy (↑7.8%), privacy compliance ( < 2.0), and explainability scores.

However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) restricted perception range of traditional onboard sensors (e.g., radar, cameras), leading to insufficient decision robustness in complex scenarios; (2) poor training stability in Deep Q-Networks (DQN) due to Q-value overestimation; and (3) privacy leakage and high communication overhead in centralized training.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a collaborative collision avoidance decision-making method integrating multi-source fusion and federated learning. The approach builds a 20-dimensional state space by integrating vehicle states and remote sensing data. Vehicle states include speed (normalized to [0, 30m/s] , orientation [0, 2π], acceleration [-5,3m/s2] , and steering angle [-0.6, 0.6rad]. Remote sensing data cover road curvature and hazard markers. This fusion significantly enhances the comprehensiveness of environmental perception. A Double DQN strategy (target network update interval: 100 steps) combined with batch normalization and a compound reward function (collision penalty: -100, speed rationality reward: 0.2, safe distance penalty: -0.5, risk avoidance reward: 0.5) effectively mitigates Q-value overestimation. Furthermore, a federated learning-based distributed training framework is designed, employing local model gradient updates (privacy budget ε < 1.0) and data volume-weighted FedAvg aggregation (cycle: 10 seconds, minimum 3 clients) to achieve privacy-preserving efficient collaborative training.","","979-8-3315-2583-5","10.1109/CCPQT66408.2025.11383287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11383287","Vehicle Collision Avoidance;Multi-Source Perception Fusion;Federated Learning;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Privacy Preservation","Training;Space vehicles;Privacy;Federated learning;Collaboration;Sensor fusion;Stability analysis;Robustness;Collision avoidance;Remote sensing","","","","14","IEEE","17 Feb 2026","24-26 Oct. 2025","24-26 Oct. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, cloud during satellite overpasses can prevent this. This work aims to estimate important VIs derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral data, using a combination of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and field dates (sowing, ponding and PI) to fill data gaps. We used 7,336 fields harvested in the 2018-2023 seasons for training, and 1,804 fields from 2024 for testing. The LightGBM algorithm produced the best results compared with random forest, ridge and lasso regression. Day of season (DOS) alone outperformed SAR data (CIRE RMSE 10% vs 13%). However the best results (RMSE 6%) were obtained by fusing DOS, field dates and SAR data.

In this paper, we explore the use of blockchain in cloud, fog, and edge computing services. We analyze the unique characteristics of these services and how blockchain technology can enhance them. One of the benefits of blockchain in cloud computing is that it allows for secure and transparent data sharing among multiple parties. Blockchain can ensure the authenticity and integrity of data with smart contracts, which can automate processes and eliminate the need for intermediaries. This can result in cost savings and increased efficiency. In fog computing, blockchain can be used to enable secure and real-time data processing at the network edge. This can improve latency and reduce bandwidth consumption by processing data closer to the source. Additionally, blockchain-based fog computing can provide better data privacy and security for connected devices. Edge computing can benefit from blockchain by providing a trustless environment for data sharing and storage. Edge devices can act as nodes in a blockchain network, allowing for decentralized control and increased security. This can enable new use cases such as peer-to-peer transactions and autonomous decision making.

To ensure the food quality and safety of cold chain logistics warehouses, and achieve cost reduction and efficiency improvement, this study focuses on the operational scenarios of stereo warehouses in cold chain logistics, and designs a five-dimensional digital twin model with full mapping and multidimensional simulation. By integrating heterogeneous data from multiple sources, it achieves real-time visualization and monitoring of all elements in warehouses, and proposes a model optimization strategy that supports system-linked decision-making. This strategy intelligently adjusts the load and thermal distribution in the temperature-controlled zones of warehouses to maximize operational efficiency and reduce operating costs.

To achieve efficient integration for the data fused by various sensors, the data should be perfectly synchronized and out-of-errors.

The SyncED-Ocean project deployed a digital twin for a two-month period during summer 2024. This digital twin integrated Earth Observation (EO) data with in-situ measurements from autonomous, crewed, and fixed ocean platforms. A modular data analysis toolbox was developed to cross-calibrate EO and in-situ data, ensuring quality-controlled assimilation into a virtual twin model at daily intervals. Forecasts and nowcasts generated by the virtual twin model were analysed by AI-driven applications to optimise future data collection by generating and transmitting mission plans to autonomous underwater vehicles in real-time. This closed-loop digital twin system provided optimised high spatial and temporal resolution data suitable for detecting phytoplankton blooms and related deoxygenation events as they emerge. Key lessons from the deployment highlight the need for rigorous engineering in data integration and management, ensuring resilience against erroneous data. Trade-offs between data timeliness and quality necessitated redesigning workflows to meet strict operational timeframes while maintaining data integrity. Additionally, despite automation, human-on-the-loop monitoring remained essential for overseeing data pipelines and machine learning decision-making. These insights provide valuable guidance for future environmental digital twins, enhancing scientific understanding and supporting sustainable marine management.

In this study, a unified data engineering framework for smart mobility is provided, combining three key data streams: traffic congestion, public transportation operations (GTFS), and environmental pollutants (AQI). The architecture uses Apache Kafka and Flink for high-throughput streaming processing, performs semantic transformations using JSON-LD and GeoSPARQL, and stores spatiotemporal data with PostGIS and InfluxDB. A fusion engine aligns data streams to a common time and geo-spatial grid and screens out anomalies based on Z-score thresholds. Predictive modeling uses XGBoost and LSTM to predict AQI based on using multimodal input such as PM2.5, NO2, and vehicle count. The results of the evaluation show that XGBoost significantly outperforms LSTM, with a lower MAE (0.032) and RMSE (0.061), and higher R2 (0.9999), which makes it suitable for real-time operation.

Many such devices sense the deployed environment and generate a variety of data and send them to the server for analysis as data streams. A Data Stream Manager (DSM) at the server collects the data streams (often called big data) to perform real time analysis and decision-making for these critical applications. A malicious adversary may access or tamper with the data in transit. One of the challenging tasks in such applications is to assure the trustworthiness of the collected data so that any decisions are made on the processing of correct data. Assuring high data trustworthiness requires that the system satisfies two key security properties: confidentiality and integrity. To ensure the confidentiality of collected data, we need to prevent sensitive information from reaching the wrong people by ensuring that the right people are getting it. Sensed data are always associated with different sensitivity levels based on the sensitivity of emerging applications or the sensed data types or the sensing devices. For example, a temperature in a precision agriculture application may not be as sensitive as monitored data in smart health. Providing multilevel data confidentiality along with data integrity for big sensing data streams in the context of near real time analytics is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Selective Encryption (SEEN) method to secure big sensing data streams that satisfies the desired multiple levels of confidentiality and data integrity. Our method is based on two key concepts: common shared keys that are initialized and updated by DSM without requiring retransmission, and a seamless key refreshment process without interrupting the data stream encryption/decryption. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of our SEEN method show that it can significantly improve the efficiency and buffer usage at DSM without compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data streams.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2702172","AISRF-08140; ARC(grant numbers:LP140100816); NSF(grant numbers:1652107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7921576","Big data stream;selective encryption;data confidentiality;data integrity;data security","Big data;Real-time systems;Sensors;Encryption","","38","","50","IEEE","8 May 2017","1 Sept. 2019","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The lack of adequate data management platforms to harvest emergency-related data from the proliferation of data sources scattered around a city is a major shortfall in current emergency response and risk assessment processes. We propose an improved information infrastructure to assist emergency personnel in responding effectively and proportionally to large-scale, distributed, unstructured natural and man-made hazards such as multi-vehicle accidents, outbreaks of human or animal diseases, major weather events, large fires, and terrorist attacks.

Our infrastructure consists of three components: (1) large-scale crowdsensing and data quality valuation, (2) heterogeneous data integration and analytics, and (3) decision making, alternative generation and recommendations.

Gauging population sentiment for targeted response areas and having the ability to predict or control sentiment within these areas is invaluable. Review of reception towards deployed forces must be analyzed, especially in areas vital for U.S. national interests. Predicting population behavior is critical for success and must include a qualitative as well as a quantitative solution. Additionally, a feedback mechanism is needed for periodically updating reception towards presence of U.S. Forces over time. We propose a method for predicting sentiment towards deployed U.S. Forces in near real time, to efficiently propitiate manpower resources, allocate equipment assets, and reduce cost of analyses. Sentiment prediction is becoming an increasingly important and feasible task based on social media, open source data, physical imagery and abundance of video data feeds. Predicting reaction to events can be time consuming. Locating the most likely affected areas is very tedious, requiring much human labor effort, and it is often difficult to obtain the best information on a timely basis.

The traditional practice of signing documents on verified stamp papers could no longer serve as an adequate countermeasure against modern-day digital malpractices. The most common digital methods currently circulating provide either secure document delivery through cryptographic signatures or document analysis via AI, while very few cover both. This paper aims to present an integrated online application embracing two independent functions: document verification using blockchain techniques and document summarization using AI. This guarantees secure verification of documents through a mechanism that generates cryptographic hashes and compares them to the entries on a privately deployed Ethereum blockchain for tamper-evident yet nonrevealing authentication. Concurrently, the summarization module uses machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to allow users to extract key clauses and important terms from documents, thus saving a great deal of user effort in interpreting lengthy legal content. In contrast to existing systems focusing separately on security or content processing, this integrated platform unlike existing systems that focus either only on security or only on content processing, addresses both integrity and accessibility.

To address these challenges, in this study, we developed a robust multi-object detection and tracking method for moving objects based on radar and camera data fusion. First, the radar and camera perform target detection independently, and the detection results are correlated in the image plane to generate a random finite set with an object type. Then, based on the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density algorithm framework, the tracking process is improved using elliptic discriminant thresholds, an attenuation function, and simplified pruning methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can accurately estimate the number and state of targets in object occlusion, measurement loss scenarios, and achieve robust continuous multi-object tracking. The proposed method could guide the design of safer and more efficient intelligent driving systems.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3049449","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0105002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314172","Sensor fusion;detection and tracking of moving object;attenuation function;robust","Target tracking;Radar detection;Radar;Object detection;Radar imaging;Radar tracking;Cameras","","68","","40","IEEE","5 Jan 2021","1 May1, 2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, it is essential to analyze the stability of slopes continuously to identify the potential landslide sections. The stability of slopes is defined by the factor of safety (FOS). To track the immediate changes in soil stability, it is essential to monitor multiple environmental parameters using Internet of Things (IoT) devices for real-time decision making. Further, the relation between the environmental parameters and FOS is nonlinear which makes it a multivariate and complex problem. To motivate the above-mentioned challenges, in this article, we propose a new fusion-based bag-of-neural network (FuBoNN) model for predicting FOS using a set of IoT devices in edge networks. Besides that, for increasing the prediction accuracy of FOS, multiple laboratory data related to FOS are fused over the monitoring parameters and prepare a rich data set. The newly created fused data set is fed into the population-based neural network (NN) and the best NN is selected in each iteration that transfers its knowledge to the population. The fused data set is categorized into four class labels to simulate the stability issue of residual soil and fed to the input of the proposed FuBoNN model, which provides a 0.0003% of error in predicting the multiple categories of the FOS.

Command by intent is a paradigm that empowers subordinate units to exercise measured initiative to meet mission goals and accept prudent risk within commander's intent. It improves agility of military operations by allowing exploitation of local opportunities without an explicit directive from the commander to do so. This paper discusses what the paradigm entails in terms of architectural decisions for data fusion systems tasked with real-time information collection to satisfy operational mission goals. In our system, information needs of decisions are expressed at a high level, and shared among relevant nodes. The selected nodes, then, jointly operate to meet mission information needs by forwarding and caching relevant data without explicit directives regarding the objects to fetch and sources to contact. A preliminary evaluation of the system is presented using a target tracking application, set in the context of a NATO-based mission scenario, called Anglova. Evaluation results show that delegating some decision authority to the data fusion system (in terms of objects to fetch and sources to contact) allows it to save more network resources, while also increasing mission success rate. The system is therefore particularly well-suited to operation in partially denied or contested environments, where resource bottlenecks caused by adversarial activity impair one's ability to collect real-time information for mission-critical decision making.","","978-0-9964527-6-2","10.23919/ICIF.2018.8455376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8455376","IoBT;Command-by-intent;Decision-centric","Decision trees;Data integration;Sensor systems;Prefetching;Bandwidth;Sensor fusion","","2","","14","","6 Sep 2018","10-13 July 2018","10-13 July 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The standard Closest Point of Approach (CPA) method, used to estimate collision risk, has limitations due to its reliance on constant Course Over Ground (COG) and Speed Over Ground (SOG) assumptions, neglecting dynamic vessel behaviours, true ship dimensions, and environmental influences. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces an enhanced CPA (eCPA) method that counters these deficits by incorporating ship trajectory predictions, probabilistic risk assessment, and real-time data integration. The eCPA method includes user-adjustable tools for trajectory interpolation, prediction, and anomaly elimination, making it adaptable to various maritime scenarios. Extensive testing in encounter scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving maritime safety through robust and probabilistic estimation of encounter points.

However, these models are inherently statistical predictors rather than real-time reasoning systems, leading to fundamental limitations in accessing up-to-date information and verifying factual accuracy. This issue is particularly critical in high-stakes domains such as cryptocurrency markets, decentralized finance (DeFi), and autonomous AI agents, where real-time, verifiable, and tamper-proof information is essential for decision-making.In this paper, we introduce AI Oracle, a novel framework that integrates blockchain-powered oracles with LLMs and autonomous agents to ensure real-time access to cryptographically verified knowledge. We compare AI Oracle with both standalone LLMs and retrieval-based systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), highlighting significant advantages in factual reliability, adversarial robustness, and interpretability. AI Oracle combines decentralized consensus, immutable storage, and cryptographic attestation to equip AI agents with enhanced resistance to manipulation, hallucination, and misinformation.Beyond architectural improvements, we explore the broader applicability of AI Oracle across domains that require provable correctness and trust—ranging from real-world asset (RWA) tokenization to autonomous agent coordination and decentralized governance. By positioning AI Oracle as a trust-minimized epistemic infrastructure, we propose a new paradigm in AI systems: the fusion of decentralized trust with autonomous reasoning, enabling agents to operate with resilience, transparency, and embedded verifiability across dynamic environments.","","979-8-3315-8749-9","10.1109/CVC65719.2025.00007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11068814","Price Oracle;Blockchain Technology;LLM;AI Agent;RWA","Protocols;Finance;Training data;Decentralized applications;Real-time systems;Cognition;Autonomous agents;Tokenization;Cryptocurrency;Artificial intelligence","","1","","18","IEEE","8 Jul 2025","5-6 June 2025","5-6 June 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, despite the pilot can be equipped with an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) and he can rely on a Decision Support System (DSS), he still lacks in weather-related information. In fact, generally he has available only preflight-loaded forecasts and periodic updates data, usually in text format (such as METAR bulletin, NOTAM and PIREP messages, etc.) from the competent authorities. To increase the amount of information available to the pilot, perhaps by upgrading the avionic weather radar (AWR) to a polarimetric AWR and by introducing and integrating next generation avionic sensors (for humidity, pressure, wind shear, etc.) by itself does not directly help the pilot's decision-making process. In other words, the amount of heterogeneous data gathered in real time by the avionic systems need to be processed together with the stored information and to be provided to the pilot in a fast-interpreting format. In order to accomplish this task, a continuously updated risk map is necessary both to the pilot, through direct display, and to the DSS, which evaluates and suggests alternative routes. In this paper, we outline a method for determining the risk map related to weather phenomena encountered by the aircraft. Such method, based on the processing of heterogeneous information from multiple source (in particular from an advanced, polarimetric AWR with improved functionalities and increased performances), is conceived to provide the input to algorithms suggesting to the pilot the optimum path in terms of safety and emission reduction.","","978-1-4799-7569-3","10.1109/MetroAeroSpace.2015.7180700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7180700","avionic weather hazard;risk map;risk factor","Aircraft;Hazards;Aerospace electronics;Radar;Rain;Sensors","","6","","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2015","4-5 June 2015","4-5 June 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present Kilo-UAV, the first multispectral micro-UAV detection dataset specifically designed for kilometer-range imaging, comprising 21 940 synchronously acquired multispectral remote sensing (RS) observations (visible-light, near-infrared (NIR), polarized imagery, and atmospheric attenuation-corrected data). The dataset focuses on UAV targets characterized by submeter dimensions and minimal pixel occupancy (average pixel area ratio <0.7%), systematically encompassing ten types, including urban built-up areas, coastal zones, and montane forests. To resolve the critical bottleneck of multisource RS data fusion, we propose the adaptive decision fusion network for remote sensing (ADF-RS). This architecture integrates an anomaly-modality sensitivity assessment module to dynamically optimize sensor-specific contribution weights, thereby enabling spatially coordinated representation of multispectral features. Experimental validation demonstrates that ADF-RS achieves state-of-the-art performance with an 86.57% detection accuracy ( $\text {mAP}_{{50}}$ ) on the test set, outperforming conventional visible-light-based approaches by a 23%-point margin, while maintaining real-time processing efficiency (57 frames/s on NVIDIA RTX3090 hardware). We further propose a lightweight computational framework optimized for edge computing devices, offering an embeddable solution for UAV airspace regulation within existing RS infrastructures.

Access to high-frequency spatial and temporal information facilitates real-time event detection or then understanding the impact of pollution to the water quality in natural water resources. In this paper, we report a multi-sensor process that we developed for in-situ monitoring of water pollution in rivers/lakes in which we acquire real-time water quality data using (a) a multiparametric sensor probe for quantitative data, (b) a crowd sensor via a mobile app for qualitative data and integrate these data onto a cloud platform i.e Bluemix which enables interactive visualization of data as Heatmap combined with geographical mapping. This type of visualization technique not only facilitates effective handling of high-resolution data but also allows large-scale data-driven inspection to identify affected/polluted zones and detection of pollution violations, thereby making it an important tool for enabling decision-making. Data analysis based on clustering techniques is also presented. We compare our techniques to traditional data collection methods. Furthermore, to support our efforts in water quality monitoring, we have also developed several web-based applications that are aimed at incorporating sensing data as well as data from various other sources onto a common online platform.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid framework named A*D3QN, which integrates the heuristic efficiency of the A* algorithm with the adaptive decision-making of a dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN), associated with the multimodal data fusion for precise environment modeling. The proposed A*D3QN incorporates prior knowledge from the global paths generated by A* to initialize and guide the D3QN learning process. The prior knowledge, formatted as RL transition tuples, is used in the reward function design and the N-step prioritized experience replay, which significantly accelerates overall learning efficiency. Moreover, an improved D3QN architecture is designed to dynamically fuse visual data and navigation states via a cross-entropy attention mechanism, enabling multimodal perception in partially unknown environments. Extensive experiments across three scenarios with varying obstacle densities demonstrate that A*D3QN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DRL baselines.

The conventional centralized systems usually have difficulties in providing end-to-end visibility, effective resource distribution, and secure exchange of data among various stakeholders. To overcome these challenges, this paper will present a framework of the Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Optimization (BISCON), which uses Intelligent Edge Computing (IEC) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to achieve better efficiency and reliability of its operations. BISCON incorporates blockchain technology to facilitate immutable, transparent, and decentralized data management, and IEC facilitates low-latency processing and analytics of data at the network edge, eliminating the need to rely on centralized cloud servers. Moreover, the use of evolutionary algorithms maximizes the logistics parameters like inventory management, transportation planning, and forecasts the demand based on the data-driven adaptive decision-making process. The suggested BISCON model design was modeled in terms of a hybrid testbed that consists of blockchain nodes and edge devices, and it demonstrated a tremendous enhancement in transaction speed, data integrity, and energy efficiency over traditional cloud-based methods. The findings of the experiments prove a 32 percent decrease in the computational delay, a 25 percent increase in the supply chain throughput, and increased resilience to cyber attacks. Finally, the BISCON framework creates a robust, scalable, and intelligent supply chain ecosystem that fills the gap between blockchain trust mechanisms and instantaneous edge intelligence that supports next-generation industrial automation and secure exchange of data.","","979-8-3315-9103-8","10.1109/ICIIET65921.2025.11378065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11378065","Blockchain;Edge Computing;Evolutionary Algorithm;Supply Chain Optimization;Data Security;Intelligent Systems","Adaptation models;Data security;Computational modeling;Supply chains;IEC;Evolutionary computation;Data models;Blockchains;Optimization;Edge computing","","","","19","IEEE","19 Feb 2026","4-6 Dec. 2025","4-6 Dec. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The accuracy of trust evaluations may be impacted by the failure of traditional trust measurements to take resilience under dynamic settings into consideration. In order to assess the flexibility and resilience of trust assessment models in cloud computing, this research presents a new metric called the Resilience-Aware Assessment. The Risk Assessment offers a thorough assessment of trust models in a variety of cloud environments by taking into account elements including system performance during high stress, reaction to malevolent activity, and recovery time following interruptions. In order to compare various trust evaluation models already in use, this study evaluates them using the RAA in addition to other traditional criteria like accuracy, scalability, and convergence time. The findings show that the RAA metric, especially in situations with uncertainty and volatility, successfully draws attention to trust model strengths and shortcomings that are missed by traditional metrics. The integration of the RAA metric into multi-criteria decision-making frameworks for cloud service selection is also covered in the article, offering a more adaptable and robust method for evaluating trust.

In order to provide a solid foundation for the administration and optimization of smart city systems, this paper will suggest using blockchain and digital twin (DT) technologies. Virtual copies of physical objects called “digital twins” provide real‐time monitoring, analysis, and management of urban assets. Distributed and immutable ledger technology, blockchain ensures data integrity, security, and transparency. Data silos, security holes, and trust issues are some of the major challenges in smart city management that the proposed framework aims to address by integrating different technologies. This statement outlines a number of difficulties. Create digital twins of buildings, transportation networks, and utility networks as a first step in the integration process. These digital twins are constantly updating their data sets with information gathered from sensors, IoT devices, and other sources so they can provide a comprehensive view of the city's operational status. The next step is to employ blockchain technology to decentralize and secure the storage of digital twin data, making it impossible for unauthorized parties to access, alter, or damage the data. Smart contracts, which are executable codes stored on the blockchain, may automate and streamline processes inside the smart city ecosystem. Among the many advantages of this integrated approach are improved transparency in smart city operations, more security, and more accurate data. Blockchain's distributed ledger technology ensures that no one party has exclusive control over the data it stores, which fosters confidence and collaboration among all parties involved. The Blockchain Foundation is responsible for creating the blockchain.

Traditional maintenance strategies, such as reactive maintenance (repair after failure) and preventive maintenance (scheduled maintenance), often prove inadequate in addressing these issues. This not only minimizes downtime but also optimizes maintenance resources and extends the lifespan of equipment. Machine learning models used in Predictive maintenance (PdM) are designed to analyze large volumes of data generated by industrial equipment. Reinforcement learning optimizes maintenance schedules by learning from interactions with the environment, balancing the trade-off between maintenance costs and equipment reliability. Black-box models, such as deep learning, often provide high accuracy but lack transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are being developed to make these models more interpretable, enabling users to gain insights into the decision-making process and build confidence in the predictions. The deployment of ML models in industrial environments also requires seamless integration with existing systems. This involves addressing issues related to real-time data processing, scalability, and model retraining. Edge computing and cloud-based solutions are being explored to handle large-scale data processing and storage, while online learning techniques allow models to adapt to new data continuously. This paper presents several case studies from industries such as manufacturing, energy, transportation, and healthcare, illustrating the successful application of ML in PdM. In manufacturing, ML models have been used to predict failures in machinery such as turbines, compressors, and conveyor belts, leading to significant reductions in downtime and maintenance costs. The energy sector has employed ML for the maintenance of critical infrastructure, including power grids and wind turbines, enhancing operational efficiency and reliability.","","979-8-3503-5421-8","10.1109/ASIANCON62057.2024.10837862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10837862","Predictive maintenance;XAI;Reinforcement learning;IIOT;ROI,","Industries;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Transportation;Medical services;Predictive models;Data models;Real-time systems;Maintenance;Predictive maintenance","","5","","15","IEEE","21 Jan 2025","23-25 Aug. 2024","23-25 Aug. 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Financial data, comprising economic indicators, stock market information, and monetary transactions, needs protection against unauthorized access and leakage. The study introduces a privacy preservation framework named SecureFinGuard that has been specifically developed for financial information in a cloud environment. It consists of two major steps: Data Sanitization and Data Restoration. SecureFinGuard Algorithm is a new meta-heuristic approach that generates an optimal key that is utilized to hide sensitive data in cloud storage and transmission processes. Later, the same key is employed by legitimate users to recover the data, which recovers the original dataset. The performance of the framework is quantified in terms of three key parameters: Degree of Modification (DM), Hiding Rate (HR), and Information Preservation Rate (IP) at the cost of compromising data quality and privacy. Minimization in the amount of modification done on private data and maximization in information retention can be formulated as an objective function. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs a 92% reduction in data modification, a 90% improvement in hiding rate, and an 85% preservation of essential information, successfully achieving a trade-off between privacy and data integrity. The results indicate the efficiency of the framework as a robust solution for secure money-related cloud-based data management.","","979-8-3315-2476-0","10.1109/ETCC65847.2025.11108508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11108508","SecureFinGuard;Data Integrity;Data Confidentiality;Privacy Preservation;Data Sanitization;Data Restoration","Cloud computing;Data privacy;Privacy;Differential privacy;Data integrity;Scalability;Real-time systems;Homomorphic encryption;Stock markets;Protection","","","","16","IEEE","12 Aug 2025","26-27 June 2025","26-27 June 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Autonomy and networking are crucial aspects to consider in order to overcome the challenges typical of the marine environment, such as the limitations in underwater communications. This paper addresses both these aspects, describing the cooperative autonomy architecture and the strategies of the AUVs of the CMRE Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) network. We report tests from the LCAS18 trial. In this trial, cooperative strategies were supported by data sharing, facilitating track classification and the creation of a common tactical picture. The CMRE intelligent Cooperative Autonomous Decision Making Engine (iCADME) controlled the various phases of the robot mission. The produced tracks were classified in real-time and the ones likely to be generated by a target were selected to trigger a cooperative track prosecution strategy. The final objective was to facilitate track-to-track associations for the final target confirmation. To support cooperative autonomy, in LCAS18, the novel CMRE Cognitive Communication Architecture (CCA) was used in the CMRE ASW network for the first time. CCA managed the communications, with the aim of improving the use of the available bandwidth.The results from LCAS18 are one of the first examples in literature demonstrating the potentials of cooperative autonomy strategies and data fusion in realistic surveillance scenarios. Only autonomous decisions can in fact improve the mission performance when a reliable communication channel with the Command and Control centre cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, cooperative decisions and data sharing allow to exploit the spatial diversity that robotic networks can provide.","","978-1-7281-1450-7","10.1109/OCEANSE.2019.8867431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8867431","Anti-Submarine Warfare;Robotic Networks;Cooperative Autonomy;Data Fusion;Underwater Acoustic Communications;Data-Driven Strategies","Target tracking;Robot sensing systems;Sonar;Task analysis;Data integration","","13","","25","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","17-20 June 2019","17-20 June 2019","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Federated Learning (FL) allows AVs to collaboratively train models while keeping raw data localized. However, traditional FL systems are vulnerable to security threats, including adversarial attacks, data breaches, and dependency on a central aggregator, which can be a single point of failure. To address these concerns, this paper introduces a peer-to-peer decentralized federated learning system that integrates lightweight blockchain technology and Binius Zero- Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enhance security and privacy. In this system, Binius ZKPs ensure that model updates are cryptographically verified without exposing sensitive information, guaranteeing data confidentiality and integrity during the learning process. The lightweight blockchain framework secures the network by creating an immutable, decentralized record of all model updates, thus preventing tampering, fraud, or unauthorized modifications. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for a central aggregator, significantly enhancing system resilience to attacks and making it suitable for dynamic environments like AV networks. Additionally, the system's design includes Byzantine resilience, providing protection against adversarial nodes and ensuring that the global model aggregation process remains robust even in the presence of malicious actors. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves low-latency, scalability, and efficient resource usage while maintaining strong security and privacy guarantees, making it an ideal solution for real-time federated learning in autonomous vehicle networks. The proposed framework not only ensures privacy but also fosters trust among participants in a fully decentralized environment.","","979-8-3315-0973-6","10.1109/SIN63213.2024.10871337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10871337","ZKPs;Data Integrity;Peer-to-Peer;Cryptography;Model Poisoning","Privacy;Fault tolerance;Differential privacy;Federated learning;Scalability;Data models;Real-time systems;Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Autonomous vehicles","","2","","17","IEEE","13 Feb 2025","2-4 Dec. 2024","2-4 Dec. 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the widespread use of IoT devices, more than 75 percent of businesses do not follow a data-driven methodology. This is mainly due to obstacles such as the complexity of data integration, a lack of standardization, and insufficient technical skills. This paper examines the obstacles and highlights the transforming impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in converting IoT data into actionable insights that improve decision-making processes across diverse industries in smart cities. By addressing the complexities of data integration, AI and machine learning (ML) offer scalable solutions enabling real-time analytics, predictive modeling, and effi- cient resource management. This paper discusses specific applications of AI and ML in different industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, and agriculture. For example, AI-powered predictive maintenance in manufacturing helps reduce maintenance costs by up to 25 percent, while intelligent energy management in buildings can optimize energy consumption, enabling reduced costs by up to 30percent. In healthcare, AI-powered monitoring improves patient outcomes, and in agriculture, data-driven precision techniques can increase agricultural yields by 15percent. These figures indicate how important the role of Machine Learning is expected to be across verticals of the industry in the next few decades. The IoT trends indicate that implementing edge an-alytics further enhances the capabilities and efficiency of AI and ML. It allows for quick decision-making at the main source of data, therefore reducing latency and bandwidth demands. This paper is concluded by discussing the importance of AI and ML in unlocking the full potential of IoT investments, driving efficiencies, reducing costs, and improving the quality of urban living.

To achieve the goals, the approach relies on the optoelectronic properties of carbon nanomaterials and already combines AI and deep learning. This raises the level of sensing, real-time data fusion, and adaptive decision-making within the environment to unprecedented levels. To enhance sensor evaluation in sensor manufacturing, we take a step further and implement Dombi Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (D-IVIFs) and work with Dombi Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Dombi Bonferroni Mean (D-IVIFDBM) for hierarchical decision-making. Moreover, two Multi-Attribute Group Decision Making (MAGDM) methods IVIFWDBM and IVIFWDGBM are developed for expert evaluation aggregation in selection tasks of different criteria to enhance selection accuracy. These experiments did demonstrate improvements in decision accuracy as well as better overall performance than conventional models of comparison. The numerical experiments showed that these methods are more effective than traditional MAGDM models. Introducing such an advanced decision framework in deep learning systems enables improved adaptability, security, and resilience in next-generation sensor networks and biosensor devices. The new paradigm enables real-time signal interpretation and adaptive learning and provides effective solutions in harsh environments where severe fluctuations are common. This study assists in addressing the discrepancy between conceptual decision models and actual physical achievements in smart sensing, which will foster the development of more sophisticated and efficient optoelectronic devices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3567561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10988855","Modern smart sensor networks;biosensor systems based on carbon materials;hybrid neural-fuzzy systems with deep learning;Dombi operations;innovations in optoelectronic devices and artificial intelligence;systems of uncertainty modeling","Decision making;Biosensors;Deep learning;Biological system modeling;Intelligent sensors;Optoelectronic devices;Mathematical models;Accuracy;Uncertainty;Computational modeling","","2","","49","CCBY","6 May 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The majority of production lines employ numerous sensors to generate data that is nearly real‐time. Analyzing industrial IoT datasets and extracting useful information, such as failure spots with overhead estimates, is difficult. This study offers a simple technique for building a digital twin from sensor data collected from industrial production lines. With the capacity to offer a semantic query mechanism, we give a way for extracting and inferring information from wide production line data and improving production process management. The suggested system frequently employs inference‐based questions that are analogous to formal queries and are supported by sentences. Sensors on industrial production lines generate massive volumes of data that may be utilized to build digital twin models, which are simulations of actual assets. These models can give useful insights while also assisting in the analysis and optimization of industrial processes. However, without a semantic query method, extracting and inferring information from this data may be difficult. Knowledge graphs, a sort of graph‐based structure that records interactions between objects, are used as a basic way for formalizing knowledge into digital twin models in this work. Conjunctive queries and inference rules can be applied to knowledge graphs using the semantic query language that is introduced by the proposed system. The suggested system uses a dataset from an actual industrial production line to show the efficacy of our methodology.</p>","","9781394195312","10.1002/9781394195336.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10705135.pdf&bkn=10705130&pdfType=chapter","","Data models;Predictive models;Deep learning;Prediction algorithms;Monitoring;Maintenance;Load modeling;Industries;Business;Analytical models","","","","","","4 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Static analytic approaches provide a thorough and quantitative evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic by utilising data from numerous sources, including epidemiological reports, medical records, and social media platforms. With the help of this method, scientists and decision-makers can better understand the behaviour of the virus, locate possible hotspots, and create evidence-based mitigation strategies. In the context of COVID-19, static analysis is applied across a wide range of fields, including but not limited to data mining, machine learning, and statistical modelling. These methods make it possible to find hidden trends, forecast illness progression, and assess the success of public health initiatives. Furthermore, the efficiency and precision of decision-making processes are improved by the incorporation of static analysis with real-time data streams. Stakeholders can quickly adapt to new difficulties by keeping an eye on crucial indicators like infection rates, hospitalisations, and vaccine coverage. They can then tailor their activities to address these challenges.","","979-8-3503-3324-4","10.1109/ICCPCT58313.2023.10245554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10245554","Algorithm;data-set;deep learning;Large language model (LLM);Prediction","COVID-19;Analytical models;Pandemics;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Static analysis;Data models","","","","11","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","10-11 Aug. 2023","10-11 Aug. 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The developed system addresses the inefficiencies and human errors of traditional quality control methods, which delay defect detection, product recalls, or legal risks. While Industry 4.0 technologies, particularly ML, enable predictive analytics and process optimization, existing solutions are scenario-specific, so they lack adaptability across diverse manufacturing settings. To overcome this limitation, we investigated the needs of three different manufacturing companies (A, B, and C) through interviews and identified system requirements such as integration of heterogeneous data, flexible model deployment, real-time monitoring, anomaly alerts, and compatibility with multiple platforms. The developed system was implemented in Python, featuring an extract, load, transform (ELT) pipeline using Apache Spark (PySpark) and Apache Airflow for large-scale data processing and automation. A lightweight web-based interface developed with Streamlit enables users to explore data, adjust parameters, and visualize results interactively. The system performs data integration, machine learning model deployment, real-time visualization, and quality analytics.

Targeting generalized problem domains, our framework can naturally handle the scenarios where different sensor nodes observe different sets of events whose numbers of possible classes may also be different. GDA also makes no assumption about the availability level of ground truth label information, while being able to take advantage of any if present. For these reasons, our approach can be applied to a much broader spectrum of sensing scenarios.

Whether it is urban NOA or AVP (Automated Valet Parking), multi-source data fusion technology is needed, involving cameras, lidars, radars, ultrasonic sensors, etc. However, the key factor affecting multi-source data fusion is the weight distribution problem. The target motion attributes output by multiple sensors when detecting the same target at different positions are different, especially the accuracy of the target at the edge of the FOV (field of view) is significantly reduced. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-sensor dynamic weight distribution algorithm with improved Kalman filtering. The influence factors of the algorithm in this paper consider the longitudinal distance and the circumferential angle, and the reliability of the theoretical model is verified by numerical simulation results, which can provide an important reference for the fusion technology of radars, lidars and ultrasonic radars. In addition, based on the dynamic weight distribution algorithm, this paper also gives a dynamic effective detection area, which can improve the early warning measurement when the moving target enters the area, and also effectively improves the safety factor of autonomous driving, which provides a new theoretical model for the realization of intelligent transportation and the realization of more advanced autonomous driving.","","978-1-83724-021-0","10.1049/icp.2023.3350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10400682","","","","1","","","","16 Jan 2024","10-12 Nov. 2023","10-12 Nov. 2023","IET","IET Conferences"

Severe diseases such as cholera, giardia, and typhoid are spread by drinking polluted water. In the region of interest, Rwanda, policymakers are not alerted of the flood plague before its hazards and consequences to the community, including shortage of inhabitants and clean water. Approaches to implementing flood risk reduction exist elsewhere in the world, but there is still a need for an effective and smarter system for flood forecasting and alerting. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT), this research paper presents a designed and prototyped system that will collect data from the sensor nodes distributed in flood-prone areas on a real-time basis, and store data on the cloud server. It will then analyze the stored data to help decision-making. The study also demonstrates how the integration of data from multiple sources contributes to an improved level of accuracy. It also features an entity that provides warnings where the usage of the GSM module will assist in disseminating the warning messages in the form of SMS to the concerned end users.

Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT, big data, cloud computing and machine learning, along with the creation of predictive and proactive digital twins, can help to reduce this number. However, buildings' thermal dynamics is a very complex process that depends on many variables. As a result, commonly used physics-based white box models are time-consuming and require vast expertise.

The architecture is validated in a case study creating a digital twin platform that enables users to define the thermal dynamics of buildings based on physical laws and real data, thus facilitating informed decision making for the best heating energy optimization strategy.

Current research on digital healthcare has focused on incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and wearable technology to deliver personalized care to the elderly population. Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual models that replicate real-world entities using real-time data and offer new possibilities for personalized healthcare. While prior studies have explored the adaptation of DTs for personalized healthcare, especially for older adults, the integration of generative AI (Gen AI) for real-time contextualized caregiver support remains underdeveloped. This study introduces an Elderly Digital Twin (EDT) framework that places Gen AI-driven personalized feedback and decision support at its core, supported by a comprehensive data pipeline, predictive modeling, and interactive user interaction. The framework integrates diverse physiological data (heart rate, SpO2, and sleep) and demonstrates feasibility and applicability by developing cardiac DT, sleep quality DT, and SpO2 monitoring DT models. Advanced predictive modeling achieved strong performance, with LSTM reaching 92% validation accuracy in sleep stage prediction, and Bi-LSTM yielding robust performance in real-time heart rate forecasting (MSE = 0.2944 and MAE = 0.3410). The EDT framework was deployed via a Node.js-based web application that offers real-time physiological monitoring, interactive 3D cardiac simulation, and GPT-4o-powered personalized feedback to enhance caregiver decision-making and elderly self-management. The primary contribution of this study is the incorporation of Gen AI into EDT to translate sensor data and predictive outputs into actionable recommendations for caregivers. The pipeline, predictive models, and ethical safeguards serve as enabling components, and this proof-of-concept study lays the groundwork for future multi-organ EDT and broader clinical use.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3607603","Petchra Pra Jom Klao Doctoral Scholarship Research Funding through the King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11153809","Elderly digital twin;human digital twins;personalized healthcare;physiological data integration;predictive models","Older adults;Medical services;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Artificial intelligence;Predictive models;Digital twins;Data models;Accuracy","","","","119","CCBY","9 Sep 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the research, the hybrid networking technology of LoRa and 5G is used to optimize the data transmission efficiency, and the evolution of line state under complex working conditions such as icing is accurately predicted by the physical-data fusion modeling method. Taking the icing growth process of a 220kV transmission line in southwest China during the winter cold wave as an example, the validity of the model is verified, and the average error of icing thickness prediction is less than 7.5%, which is significantly better than the industry standard.

This trend exacerbates structural imbalances between spectrum supply and demand and heightens the risk of cross-system interference. Traditional spectrum management now faces two major challenges: first, vast amounts of radio signal data, device parameters, and regulatory information remain fragmented without unified semantic representation or intelligent analysis, limiting their utility; second, general-purpose large models struggle with factual accuracy in specialized tasks such as frequency planning and interference tracing, falling short of the high-precision, real-time decision-making required by emerging services.

They are understood to be related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although agriculture suffers the consequences of these changes, it is one of the top global emitters of GHG. While it is complex in environmental, social, and economic aspects, there is a need to advance solutions for more sustainable agriculture. In the farm environment, an important step is the generation of GHG inventories. A GHG inventory is a systematic process for measuring and recording gas emissions and sequestration. However, generating inventories on rural properties presents many challenges due to the many variables involved, such as land use, animal husbandry, use of electricity, and fuels. One of the main challenges is to deal with this data heterogeneity. The data landscape presents obstacles such as managing source diversity, handling massive data volumes, adapting to various data formats, and ensuring real-time integration for decision-making. In this complex data landscape, ontologies emerge as a potential solution. An ontology is defined as a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. This study proposes an ontological model called CarbOnto for the syntactic and semantic integration of heterogeneous databases. Using an ontology, we intend to contribute to the standardization and interpretation of domain concepts and the addition of semantic information to generate complete GHG inventories. CarboOnto provides the means to generate farm inventories, identify imbalances, and search for solutions to neutralize gas emissions.

The IoV has evolved from basic in-vehicle information services to intelligent networking, enhancing perception and decision-making. It is now developing towards coordinated vehicle-infrastructure control with moderate sensing and decision-making. However, the traditional separation of sensing, communication, and computation functions—and even their pairwise integrations, such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), Integrated Communication and Computation (ICC), and Integrated Sensing and Computation (ISC)—create systemic inefficiencies like data redundancy and resource imbalance, which pose a critical bottleneck to the advancement of IoV. The unique characteristics of the IoV, particularly its mission objectives centered on safety and sensing, and the highly dynamic, resource-constrained network environment—compound these systemic inefficiencies, necessitating a dedicated investigation into an IoV-specific ISCC paradigm. Motivated by this, this paper provides the first in-depth, IoV-centric survey of the ISCC paradigm. First, we comprehensively review the development trajectory of the IoV, and based on this evolutionary path, define and categorize the development of ISCC into three distinct phases—Collaborative, Fusion, and Integrated—to clarify its integration process. Second, we analyze the limitations of partial integration paradigms (ISAC, ICC, ISC) and then establish a comprehensive taxonomy of ISCC implementation pathways, encompassing both physical-layer signal integration and network-level task-oriented resource management. Third, we survey the preliminary applications and research on the ISCC in the IoV and related fields. Finally, we outline the challenges and potential solutions to facilitate the realization of the ISCC in the IoV.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2025.3612388","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62231020); Innovation Capability Support Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2024RS-CXTD-01); Technology Innovation Leading Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2023KXJ-116); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11175176","ISCC;IoV;autonomous driving;ISAC;ICC;ISC","Sensors;Reliability;Autonomous vehicles;Real-time systems;Integrated sensing and communication;Bandwidth;Decision making;Computational efficiency;Data communication;Collision avoidance","","3","","239","CCBY","22 Sep 2025","2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has enabled precision farming, real-time monitoring, and decision-making that is driven by data. These interconnected systems are susceptible to assaults that could interrupt operations, damage data integrity, and cause financial losses. However, the growing reliance on IIoT devices in farming has also created new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have been developed as a result of the rising reliance on these devices. This research presents an advanced cybersecurity framework that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) with big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) in order to detect attacks and protect smart farming systems. This framework is intended to answer the issues that have been presented. In order to evaluate huge amounts of data that are produced by IIoT devices, the framework makes use of AIpowered techniques such as machine learning and deep learning. This allows for the detection of cyber risks and abnormalities in real time. The use of big data analytics makes it possible to collect and examine a wide variety of data sources, such as sensor data, weather patterns, and the operation of machinery, in order to uncover potentially malicious behaviors and weaknesses inside the system. The framework offers a complete strategy to securing smart farming operations against evolving cyber threats, such as malware assaults, unauthorized access, and data breaches. This is accomplished by combining the predictive capabilities of artificial intelligence with the scalability of big data analytics. The results of this study show that incorporating artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and industrial internet of things (IIoT) into a cybersecurity framework results in a considerable improvement in the detection and response times of threats in smart farming environments. The framework that has been provided has been shown to be capable of effectively identifying and mitigating cyberattacks while simultaneously maintaining the efficiency and reliability of farming operations, as demonstrated by experimental assessments.

Actual flight paths often deviate from these standard terminal arrival routes due to pilots requesting shortcut arrivals or ATC officers implementing holding procedures to alleviate congestion. These deviations exacerbate the dynamic complexity of air traffic management (ATM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel online learning Transformer-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Transformer-BiGRU) framework for tactical spatiotemporal flight trajectory prediction. BiGRU further obtains bidirectional sequence information to improve the Transformer’s spatiotemporal prediction. The proposed research utilises image processing techniques to produce ATC aeronautical holding instructions from historical automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast data. The framework significantly improves real-time prediction ability and environment adaptability by integrating holding instructions and online learning. Experiment results demonstrate that incorporating holding instructions with the proposed Transformer-BiGRU reduces the mean absolute error by approximately 10% in latitude, 8.9% in longitude, and 13.1% in flight level compared to the best baseline model. Furthermore, the mean deviation error of horizontal distance decreases from 0.49 to 0.42 nautical miles (a 13% improvement).

However, DTN modeling faces significant challenges, particularly in meeting diverse and dynamic requirements across heterogeneous network domains. Traditional methods often rely on predefined scalar reward functions that compress multi-objective feedback into a single value, limiting interpretability and hindering generalization and adaptability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an intelligence-based reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for adaptive 6G DTN modeling. The method introduces a high-level metric, termed “intelligence,” to quantify cognitive improvement. It models requirements as multi-dimensional random variables and replaces conventional scalar rewards to better capture the complex optimization objectives of DTN modeling.

Here, uRLLC has transformed wireless networks, enabling applications that demand unparalleled reliability, low latency, and scalability. The proposed framework employs LLMs to analyze network traffic, identify vulnerabilities, and generate dynamic security policies. Its effectiveness is evaluated based on critical performance metrics, including scalability, accuracy, jitter rate, and packet arrival rate.

However, an MSA differs from traditional one-off network attacks as it requires a set of sequential stages, whereby each stage may not be malicious when manifested individually, therefore, potentially be underestimated by current IDSs. This work proposes a new approach towards addressing this challenging type of cyber-attacks by employing external sources of information, beyond the conventional use of signatures and monitored network data. In particular, both expert knowledge and contextual information in the form of Pattern-of-Life (PoL) of the network are shown to be influential in giving an advantage against SOTA techniques.

The aim is to shift the paradigm of precision medicine further by improving risk estimates and the options of patient care that are available in the market. Once there is such data footprint, a person’s risk of developing a condition may be real. Medical predictive analytics helps in this reliance struggle. ML models similar to ""K-Nearest Neighbors"", ""Naive Bayes"", and ""Decision trees"" are applied for the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and can classify and provide predictions based on previous datasets of such. In a sense, the presented approach depends on the idea of combining and integrating information from multiple genetic components, and in turn, the genetic framework fosters analysis that is helpful for prompt action as well as therapy that are personalized. ML was done to help form models that would emphasize mechanisms of precision medicine that focuses on catching health conditions early and managing them effectively, helping people stay healthier while making healthcare more efficient. This change argues for the potential of the precision medicine’s ML targeted modeling towards the early recognition of conditions and optimizing care for better patient monitoring.

Examples of these applications include floods, earthquakes, and other kinds of natural disasters, such as typhoons. To address this issue, social media data have gradually been adopted to fill possible gaps in the analysis when remote sensing data are lacking or incomplete. In this case, the fusion of heterogeneous big data streams from multiple data sources introduces significant demands from a computational viewpoint. In order to meet these challenges, distributed computing is increasingly viewed as a feasible solution to parallelize the analysis of massive data coming from different sources (e.g., remote sensing and social media data). In this article, we provide an overview of available and new distributed strategies to address the computational challenges brought by massive heterogeneous data processing and fusion for real-time environmental monitoring and decision-making. The 2013 Boulder (Colorado) flood event is taken as a case study to evaluate several new distributed data fusion frameworks.

From civilian surfers to government managers, each user must not only navigate the vast sea of available data, but also understand it enough to select appropriate data relevant to their unique situation. Over recent years, the MARACOOS data management ecosystem has worked to remove barriers in the initial portion of the user's journey; by centralizing relevant data into one platform, MARACOOS OceansMap, data discovery has become much easier and quicker for mid-Atlantic users. However, decision fatigue quickly sets in as users must still understand and select the appropriate data sources (i.e., models vs. observations), determine which analytical tools are beneficial (i.e., weather window planning vs. validation statistics), and make other decisions to dive deeper into their analyses and interpretations. In this session, we will explore MARACOOS's experiences in combating this issue by providing users with simplified and streamlined solutions, known as Mini Apps. Tailored to distinct stakeholder groups, Mini Apps are powerful tools that provide foundational information and analyses to users, while maintaining enough flexibility that users can further customize, save, and share their own unique version of the app. Leveraging spatial views and in-depth dashboards, Mini Apps currently serve boaters and pilots, surfers, beachgoers, offshore wind developers, the general public as a stakeholder of the offshore wind industry, and other users or researchers interested in studying storm movements and climate change. Our goal in this paper will be to explore how Mini Apps could be leveraged across new stakeholder groups or provide added value to these users, and discuss their scalability across other regions and nations. MARACOOS OceansMap, powered by RPS, is a dynamic data visualization tool integrating near real-time observational assets and model forecasts that contribute to ocean monitoring in the Mid-Atlantic region. OceansMap is the flagship ocean data portal of MARACOOS, one of the eleven U.S. IOOS Regional Associations that are certified by the federal government for the quality of the data they serve. MARACOOS OceansMap enables stakeholders, partners, and the public free and open access to high quality data and information products to support decision-making on our waters and along our coasts and estuaries in the Mid-Atlantic region, from Cape Cod, MA, to Cape Hatteras, NC. By working with stakeholders and partners, MARACOOS OceansMap has evolved into a key tool used for decision making in the Mid-Atlantic. Through specialized instances of MARACOOS OceansMap, users can explore the different themes to find data relevant to a specific topic. To further improve data usability, the next generation of MARACOOS OceansMap has been created in close collaboration with NOAA CO-OPS, and with significant input from stakeholders and partners working within the maritime sector, offshore wind development, and the National Weather Service's regional Weather Forecast Offices. By engaging users across the region to provide input and feedback on OceansMap, we reduce barriers to data use by providing a more intuitive, tailored, and accessible interface that focuses on turning data into insight. MARACOOS OceansMap enhances stakeholders’ ability to prepare, manage, and respond to changing conditions in the Mid-Atlantic to protect lives and property, public and environmental health, jobs and our economy, and the overall well-being of the 79 million people residing in the Mid-Atlantic region.","2996-1882","979-8-3315-4008-1","10.1109/OCEANS55160.2024.10753881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10753881","U.S. IOOS;MARACOOS;NOAA;Data integration;Data visualization;Validation;Met-ocean;Waves;Currents;Wind;Temperature;Data stations;Mini Apps;Dashboards","Oceans;Biological system modeling;Decision making;Government;Data visualization;Turning;Data models;Stakeholders;Wind forecasting;Usability","","","","0","IEEE","25 Nov 2024","23-26 Sept. 2024","23-26 Sept. 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By integrating geographic information systems (GIS) and various spectral bands for element and terrain analysis, virtual environmental modeling has been developed, leading to the development of interactive virtual geographic atmospheres (VGA). This paper presents a novel approach to constructing a VGA using geographic information to simulate realistic atmospheric conditions in virtual environments. Here, virtual environments are created in Blender. By leveraging spatial data, topographic features and their various elements, and climate parameters, the proposed system enhances the accuracy and interactivity of the geographic simulations. The methodology involves processing geospatial datasets, integrating machine learning models, and applying visualization techniques to generate dynamic atmospheric conditions. The VGA framework has potential applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster management, and virtual tourism. This will result in more implementation and diversified usage in AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality). We also present a comparison with IoT (Internet of Things).

To solve the hidden terminal problem, collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS), which benifits from spatial diversity, has been studied intensively in CR networks. For current CSS schemes, secondary users (SUs) are generally assumed to send sensing information honestly, however, misbehaved SUs may report false sensing data to mislead and compromise the system, which is called spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. In order to defense against malicious SSDF attacks, certain evidence-theory-based secure sensing approaches have been proposed. However, in most of the current evidence-theory-based CSS schemes, only real-time evidence information is utilized to estimate the sensing reliability of cognitive users, like the difference in SNR or similarity degree. Inadequate consideration causes CSS system being vulnerable to SSDF attacks, and the correctness of global decision making cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a credible CSS scheme based on evidence theory. It evaluates the credibility of each SU with two indexes, which are the statistical reputation factor and the real-time reliability factor, respectively. In addition, considering the transmitted data rises with the number of SUs increasing, we propose a rational mass distribution (RMD) approach to adjust evidence theory to binary hypothesis test in spectrum sensing context. As a consequence, both the data volume to be transmitted and the workload at data fusion center has been reduced. Simulation results have proved that the proposed scheme is effective and robust to defense against distinctive SSDF attack patterns.","","978-1-5386-1211-8","10.1109/PIERS-FALL.2017.8293109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293109","","Sensors;Cascading style sheets;Reliability;Real-time systems;Electromagnetics;Collaboration;Cognitive radio","","","","12","IEEE","19 Feb 2018","19-22 Nov. 2017","19-22 Nov. 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, with the expansion of the sensing range, the tens of thousands of vehicles and the openness of urban road networks pose a huge challenge for real-time participant recruitment in online VCS systems. To achieve efficient city-scale VCS, this paper proposes Dec-Recruiter, a decentralized framework for online participant recruitment. Specifically, Dec-Recruiter adopts a novel decision-making mode based on virtual grid agents, where vehicles traveling in the same direction within the same grid are considered homogeneous, simplifying the recruitment of specific vehicles to the selection of the number of vehicles in each direction. Meanwhile, through policy sharing among grid agents with the same geographic features, the complexity of city-scale VCS participant recruitment is further reduced. The core of Dec-Recruiter is a multi-agent contextual double-deep Q-network algorithm, which enables grid agents with different geographic features to collaborate on network-wide sensing tasks through their asynchronous decision-making. In this process, the Gaussian function is employed to adjust the reward distribution to address cold-start and data integrity issues in VCS. In addition, to ensure the convergence and training efficiency of the model on large-scale road networks, a pre-training-based transfer learning paradigm is also introduced. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that Dec-Recruiter can effectively recruit appropriate participants in the large-scale VCS and outperforms all baselines.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2025.3547484","National Key Research and Development Project of China(grant numbers:2022YFB4300400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10923643","Vehicular crowd sensing;online participant recruitment;large-scale road network;multi-agent reinforcement learning","Sensors;Recruitment;Roads;Data integrity;Trajectory;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Decision making;Vehicle dynamics;Transportation","","15","","42","IEEE","11 Mar 2025","Oct. 2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this shift also raises critical challenges in ensuring data security, privacy, and integrity. To address these challenges, this research proposes a secure, scalable, and energy-efficient healthcare data-sharing framework by integrating Ethereum 2.0's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). The methodology involves dataset acquisition from a simulated Intensive Care Unit (ICU), data pre-processing using Min-Max normalization, Ethereum 2.0 integration for decentralized, tamper-proof data management, and ECC-based encryption for lightweight, high-security authentication. The proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in throughput ($\sim 491$ TPS), energy efficiency $(\sim 70 \%)$ reduction compared to Proof-of-Work systems), and rapid signature verification, making it suitable for real-time and high-risk healthcare environments. This system ensures secure, confidential, and authenticated data exchange, supporting cognitive decision-making in IoT-enabled healthcare applications such as ICU monitoring, remote patient management, and telehealth services. The framework provides a practical, environmentally responsible solution for next-generation healthcare infrastructures.

In this article, we propose a novel, adaptive, and unsupervised matching approach based on an Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Mechanism (EGAM). EGAM integrates a Genetic Programming (GP)-based similarity generator and a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based discriminator within an adversarial co-evolutionary framework to construct and iteratively refine similarity measures without requiring ground-truth alignments. To mitigate evaluation bias, we introduce three lightweight, reference-free metrics that guide the evolutionary search process. This design enables EGAM to operate effectively under edge conditions while accommodating semantic variability across ontologies. We validate EGAM using the OAEI Conference dataset and a suite of real-world robotic ontology matching tasks.

The increase in adoption of non-renewable energy sources has raised major concerns regarding depletion and sustainability factors. To address these emerging challenges, we propose our novel framework that incorporates comprehensive ML (abbreviated as Machine Learning) mathematical models, supervised and unsupervised ML models integrated with multi-source geospatial datasets to help identify possible contiguous regenerating renewable energy source sites, including solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro-based. By leveraging data-driven modeling, deep neural networks, and spatial intelligence, the framework improves precision in determining energy-specific sites and generates high-resolution suitability maps that demonstrate energy classification accuracies. This research highlights the essence of the proposed framework in providing sustainability outcomes and reducing dependency on non-renewable energy sources for a cleaner, greener, and more eco-friendly environment. Unlike traditional methods and conventional frameworks that rely on single-source datasets, are less adaptive towards integration with geospatial intelligence, and operate as isolated systems, the proposed framework helps save manual efforts, production costs, extensive environmental destruction, and pollution, while leveraging data-driven decision making for identifying high-potential sustainable energy infrastructure development. It also enables real-time data-driven integration with high-precision defined parameters to enhance site recommendation. The proposed framework was evaluated using both proposed and publicly accessible datasets such as NASA POWER Project, SRTM, NGDS, achieving an accuracy exceeding +85%. The framework’s mathematical modeling was assessed using multiple influential factors across distinct energy types.

But the increasing number of connected devices poses major challenges for communication efficiency, cybersecurity, and data transfer reliability. Conventional methods of resource allocation are frequently unable to accommodate changing dynamics within a network, resulting in less-than-optimum performance, security issues, and wasteful bandwidth usage. We focused on the utilization of ML approaches for adaptive resources management to improve the communication, security, and data transmission processes in IoT. The use of machine learning encompasses the adoption of these capabilities through adaptive and intelligent decision making, improving network resource management through the analysis of real-time traffic trends, the prediction of congestion and the dynamic allocation of bandwidth. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a well-established method in the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that can adapt in real-time when combined with deep neural networks (DNN), allowing IoT devices to allocate processing power and communication resources efficiently, minimizing latency and energy consumption with high throughput. Additionally, even more secure ML-based anomaly detection techniques provide a robust cybersecurity approach through the identification of intrusions, the detection of malware, and the prevention of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in IoT environments. The proposed work combines the supervised & unsupervised machine learning models to use supervised models for enhancing efficiency of transmission of data. Decentralized processing techniques, including federated learning and edge AI, decrease reliance on cloud infrastructure and boost privacy. Further, blockchain integration prevents the impossibility of unauthorized in IoT nodes, which can strengthen trust and data integrity in IoT communication. Experiments show that using the proposed ML-based resource allocation model leads to improved network performance through minimizing packet loss, reducing latency, and enhancing QoS. The results illustrate that ML-based dynamic resource allocation clearly outmaneuvers conventional static allocation methodologies to enhance IoT networks' robustness, adaptability, and fortress.","","979-8-3315-2345-9","10.1109/ICEC2NT65402.2025.11379983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11379983","Data Transmission;Dynamic Resource Allocation;IoT Communication;Federated Learning;Reinforcement Learning;Anomaly Detection;Quality of Service (QoS);Bandwidth Optimization;Network Security","Performance evaluation;Federated learning;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Quality of service;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Resource management;Security","","","","15","IEEE","19 Feb 2026","3-4 Sept. 2025","3-4 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But this move also makes things a lot more dangerous for cybersecurity. This is because enterprise systems are complicated, they keep data from a lot of different areas, and cyber attacks can get to crucial operational and financial data. Risks in SAP S/4HANA systems are continually changing and are often highly complicated. This makes it challenging for standard security systems to handle them. This is especially true when it comes to countering advanced persistent attacks, discovering fraud, and dealing with insider threats. This study recommends employing a synergistic integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain technology to enhance the security of SAP S/4HANA systems. The major goals are to lower risks, identify fraud, and keep firm data safe. The suggested method leverages AI-powered algorithms to discover unusual behavior, spot fraud tendencies, and guess where attacks might happen in real time. The system is always learning from new datasets due to deep learning and machine learning. This makes it more accurate and cuts down on false positives. Blockchain also makes sure that transactions of business data are open, immutable, and safe. We can keep audit trails safe, maintain track of financial and operational activity, and record sensitive information in a way that can't be changed with distributed ledger technology. This dual link can help businesses stay in line with requirements like GDPR, SOX, and other industry-specific rules while also making their systems safer. SAP S/4HANA is also a safer place to work because AI and blockchain work together. AI helps systems deal with tough problems, and blockchain keeps data safe and makes sure that system activities are checked in a reliable way. When utilized collectively, they can discover fraud in real time, give out early warning signals, and protect the company from hackers from outside and threats from inside. Case studies and experimental simulations demonstrate that this integrated method enhances fraud detection, accelerates its identification, and fosters greater confidence in SAP-driven decision-making across the organization. This research improves enterprise cybersecurity by providing a security architecture for SAP S/4HANA that is easy to use, scalable, and flexible. The results show that using AI with blockchain not only decreases risks but also makes security a help instead of a hindrance to business operations. This helps sure that projects for digital transformation are strong, dependable, and ready for the future.","","979-8-3315-7981-4","10.1109/ICTBIG68706.2025.11323634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11323634","Cybersecurity;Blockchain;SAP S/4HANA;Fraud Detection;Enterprise Data Protection;Digital Transformation;Artificial Intelligence;Threat Mitigation","Digital transformation;Companies;Real-time systems;Blockchains;Fraud;Security;Reliability;Artificial intelligence;Computer security;Business","","","","18","IEEE","13 Jan 2026","12-13 Dec. 2025","12-13 Dec. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional cloud-centric monitoring solutions, however, have a number of drawbacks, such as high latency, high bandwidth usage, and possible privacy threats to patient data. These restrictions jeopardise the scalability of healthcare infrastructures and impede prompt decision-making. An AI-enabled RPM architecture that combines real-time visualisation, secure cloud storage, edge computing, and machine learning is proposed in this study. The system does risk prediction and anomaly detection by utilising Random Forest classifiers that have been trained on diabetes and vitals datasets.The system minimises network dependence and reaction time by implementing inference at the edge, while the cloud backend facilitates long-term pooled analytics, storage, and model retraining. An Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) security layer is used to safeguard private health data, guaranteeing data integrity and confidentiality throughout transmission. Clinicians can view vital signs in real time, receive anomaly alerts, and analyse population-level risk using a dashboard built with Streamlit. The experimental results show that the accuracy of diabetes prediction is close to $89 \%$, anomaly detection is above $92 \%$, latency is reduced by $45 \%$, and bandwidth is saved by $47 \%$ when compared to cloud-only baselines.

AR interfaces bridge the communication gap by overlaying digital information, such as task instructions, robot intentions, and real-time performance data, directly onto the human operator's physical workspace. Concurrently, DNNs empower robotic systems with advanced perceptual capabilities, enabling real-time scene understanding, human action recognition, and predictive analytics for safe and context-aware interaction. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art, analyzing how AR enhances human situational awareness and decision-making, while DNNs facilitate robot cognition and autonomy. We further discuss the architectural integration of these technologies, present illustrative use-cases in assembly and quality inspection, and critically examine persistent challenges, including system latency, data security, and user acceptance. The convergence of AR and DNNs is posited as a cornerstone for developing truly intelligent, responsive, and efficient collaborative manufacturing ecosystems.","","979-8-3315-7981-4","10.1109/ICTBIG68706.2025.11323770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11323770","Human-Robot Collaboration;Smart Manufacturing;Augmented Reality;Deep Neural Networks;Industrial Robotics;Cyber-Physical Systems","Ergonomics;Ecosystems;Human-robot interaction;Collaboration;Artificial neural networks;Real-time systems;Safety;Human activity recognition;Augmented reality;Smart manufacturing","","","","15","IEEE","13 Jan 2026","12-13 Dec. 2025","12-13 Dec. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A technical framework addresses integration challenges with legacy infrastructure, while empirical benchmarks quantify blockchain’s trade-offs in throughput i.e. 100–3,000 Transaction per Second (TPS), latency (0.5–15 seconds), and energy efficiency. The analysis demonstrates blockchain’s unique value in tamper-proof auditability (85% completeness gains) and decentralized cross-organizational trust but reveals limitations in real-time performance and smart contract vulnerabilities (43% flaw prevalence). By contrasting blockchain with alternatives like AI-driven threat detection and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), this work provides a decision-making framework for practitioners, emphasizing hybrid models that pair blockchain’s immutability with ZTA’s granular access control.

However, introducing edge computing to IIoT inevitably results in hybrid intrusion problems and fails to satisfy the security demands of IIoT. Fortunately, Lagrange coded computing has emerged as a low-complexity and low-overhead solution for resisting hybrid intrusions during data offloading and processing. However, how to make decentralized, accurate, and real-time encoding/offloading/decoding decisions remains challenging. This article designs a fully decentralized training and decision-making framework to address the joint secure data offloading and resource allocation problem against hybrid intrusions for dynamic and uncertain IIoT, attempting to minimize the long-run energy and delay costs while improving the data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is proposed a fully decentralized multiagent actor–critic-based secure data offloading (FM-SDO) algorithm to solve the secure data offloading subproblem, wherein each industrial end device utilizes its local information to learn and execute its policy independently. This algorithm improves the structure of actor and critic networks and designs a multiagent alternant updating mechanism to increase learning accuracy, convergence, and stability. Based on the received offloading decisions of each device, each edge server leverages the Lagrange multiplier approach and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition to make fast and decentralized resource allocation decisions. Finally, we employed an IIoT intelligent production line platform named iCandyBox to test the performance of the FM-SDO algorithm. Experiment results suggest that the FM-SDO algorithm effectively reduces the total energy and delay costs while increasing the capability of resisting hybrid intrusions.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2024.3506595","Autonomous Research Program of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Power Transmission and Distribution Equipment Technology(grant numbers:2023JSSPD02); Changzhou Foundation of Science and Technology(grant numbers:CJ20220052); Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Robotics(grant numbers:2022-KF-22-10); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767677","Fully decentralized multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL);Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);Lagrange coded computing (LCC);resource allocation;secure data offloading","Industrial Internet of Things;Resource management;Servers;Computational modeling;Games;Accuracy;Training;Resists;Real-time systems;Privacy","","","","57","IEEE","27 Nov 2024","1 April1, 2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multimodal techniques increase predictive accuracy, enable strong decision-making, and enhance tailored treatments by incorporating visuals, text, sensor outputs, and genomic sequences-many different data kinds. However, handling diverse, high-dimensional data presents significant difficulties in scalability, integration, and processing efficiency; hence, creative fusion methods and AI-driven models are quite necessary. With an eye on applications in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis, cancer detection, and precision medicine, this work investigates developing trends, approaches, and obstacles in multimodal data processing. With statistical and deep learning systems, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and Bayesian models, we cover fusion methodologies, including early/late integration, kernel-based alignment, and active subspace analysis. Unified data pipelines are shown in case studies of multimodal systems, including INSMA for ICU monitoring and SCALA for genetic profiling, to be rather useful. While it offers scalable infrastructure, interpretable artificial intelligence, and cost effective computational solutions, multimodal analysis constantly struggles with noise reduction, data harmonization, and cross-modal learning. Real-time multimodal integration, including social variables in disease prediction and translational bioinformatics, should be a top priority in future studies to increase clinical relevance and extend society's impact.","","978-93-80544-60-1","10.23919/INDIACom66777.2025.11115680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11115680","Artificial Intelligence;Multimodal;deep learning;healthcare;frameworks","Deep learning;Visualization;Translation;Computational modeling;Precision medicine;Noise reduction;Genomics;Market research;Real-time systems;Diseases","","","","33","","21 Aug 2025","2-4 April 2025","2-4 April 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to manage, treat and intervene, early and accurate identification of the neurological condition is essential. This paper presents an integrated hybrid detection framework that combines bio signal-based monitoring and in-the-wild facial feature recognition, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Cat Boost as state of the art machine learning approaches. To distinguish between these neurological disorders, facial images are analyzed using a deep CNN-dense architecture, trained on a large data set. At the same time, hardware sensors provide physiological data in real-time, including heart rate (BPM), oxygen saturation (SpO2), infrared (IR) signals and motion using an MPU6050. Fusing bio signal and image data improves accuracy and reliability in the system. Results are displayed through an interactive web application, allowing for the remote tracking of patients, as well as clinical decision-making. The system proposes a non-contact, scalable and efficient solution for the early identification and ongoing monitoring of neurological disorders.

Studies have recently developed to detect the stress in a person while performing different tasks. One of the methods is through Electroencephalograph (EEG). These are the bioelectrical signals generated in a human body while performing the tasks and thus describes the activity of the brain. Any action taken by a person changes the properties of these signals. This present work focuses on the classification of baseline (relax) and stress detection using EEG sub-band power ratio as features. Support vector machine (SVM) classifier with different kernel function parameters and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with a different number of neighbors with holdout and 10-fold cross-validation technique were used to classify power ratio features in order to detect stress. To evaluate the classifier performance various performance metrics were used. It is observed that KNN with a number of neighbors as one, with Euclidean distance gives better performance in both validation techniques and also anterior frontal channel Fpl that is placed at the left side of the brain itself gives a good accuracy of 99.42%. The performance of the proposed method is verified on a publicly available mental arithmetic dataset where stress is induced while performing the mental cognitive workload i.e., mental serial subtraction.","","978-1-7281-4142-8","10.1109/ic-ETITE47903.2020.401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9077755","Stress analysis;EEG sub-bands;SVM Classifier;KNN Classifier;Power ratio;Machine-learning","Support vector machines;Measurement;Feature extraction;Market research;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Task analysis","","31","","11","IEEE","27 Apr 2020","24-25 Feb. 2020","24-25 Feb. 2020","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important aspect in these efforts is the acquisition of relevant data from various parts of a plant facility, transmitting it to a remotely-located central server in real time, contextually analyzing this data, and making it ubiquitous and readily available to authorized users for decentralized and efficient decision making for corrective action. While there are numerous ways to achieve data transmission via wired sensors and devices, the implementation is challenging in mobile assets, such as overhead cranes. Measurement and transmission devices are often installed in locations difficult to approach, and the sensor wiring is susceptible to moving members and exposure to hot and corrosive environment. This makes it difficult to ensure overall Reliability. For the same reasons, transmission of acquired data to the remote server is also impractical using wired communication in mobile assets. In this paper, we present two wireless configurations for data telemetry in mobile assets, such as overhead cranes, for the purpose of Remote Monitoring and Intelligent Predictive Diagnostics of critical systems.

There is a great need for sharing the generated data sets to enable timely decision-making across various agencies/institutions. However, this requires tremendous efforts and coordination among different sensor network agencies to come to a shared understanding for disseminating the information in a uniform and standardized way. To address these needs and achieve interoperability, syntactic standardization provides to a certain extent the data description models. In addition, semantic enrichment of the information sources is also required to understand the context of the data. In this paper we adopt standardized data models based on the Open Geospatial Consoritum (OGC) sensor web enablement framework for coastal sensor networks, which facilitates improved information retrieval on a variety of spatio-temporal scales. The semantic enrichment is achieved in terms of conceptualization of selected sensor types and other terminology involved in the coastal domain in the form of Ontologies. A coastal semantic mapping (COSEM-Map) tool developed as a part of this work facilitates the harmonization of different representations. This ontological model is amenable to querying using SPARQL, which is a standardized RDF query language. Further, sensor web services discovery aspects have been addressed by augmenting the Universal Description, discovery and Integration (UDDI) registry with Web Ontology Language for Services (OWL-S) and using a semantic matching algorithm for services discovery.

In this work, we investigate the robustness of a previously proposed ensemble-based tracking system for maneuvering target tracking, called Ensemble of KalmanNets. By drawing inspiration from the Interacting Multiple Models filter and Bayesian recursive estimation, the proposed approach preserves the interpretability of the filtering process. The system combines neural networks integration in the filtering process, with the simple Global Nearest Neighbor association method, enabling transparent optimization of measurement-to-target assignments through Mahalanobis distances. We demonstrate how improved state estimation reinforces consistent associations and, conversely, how robust association improves tracking accuracy.

Coupling this framework with the principle of security as a shared responsibility further enhances the efficacy of an integrated Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) Team within organizations to deliver secured digital solutions. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved through multi-year, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts—in terms of new capabilities—in constant investment decision planning cycles, costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this automation evolution vision for ANSPs.This paper examines the migration from today’s systems to secure, cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations, like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that must be considered for this evolution.","2155-7209","978-1-6654-3420-1","10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9594313","Automation;ATM;Cloud-native;Microservices","Automation;Costs;Online banking;Clouds;Safety;Stakeholders;Security","","3","","7","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","3-7 Oct. 2021","3-7 Oct. 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles. The system’s coordination and automation capabilities ensure efficient information flow and seamless coordination across sensing, communication, decision-making, and action stages.","","978-1-6654-7477-1","10.1109/UV56588.2022.10185519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10185519","smart home;vulnerable group support;homeless support;chronic disease management;senior care;independent living;smart energy management;smart infrastructure support;smart response system for urgent situations;smart mobility;smart humanity;information flow;material cycle;smart lifestyle management;smart community user acceptance;Universal Village;smart monitoring;smart activity understanding;human-computer interaction;computer vision;machine learning;safety and security;adversarial attach;reinforcement learning;adaptive control;system theory;dynamic relationship;coordination & automation;closed feedback loop;robustness & resilience;sustainability","Home appliances;Smart cities;Decision making;Smart homes;Medical services;Safety;Older adults","","3","","471","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","22-25 Oct. 2022","22-25 Oct. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Sleipnir: Multi-agent based stock operator framework with interpretability","X. Qian; S. Chen; Z. Sun","Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China; Thomas More Prep-Marian High School, 1701 Hall Street Hays, Kansas, USA; Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China",IEEE Access,"","2026","PP","99","1","1","The increasing complexity and volatility of modern financial markets have exposed fundamental limitations in traditional investment decision-making systems, which struggle to capture nonlinear market dynamics and adapt to rapidly evolving conditions. While deep learning approaches have shown promise in financial modeling, existing single-model frameworks remain inadequate for handling the multifaceted nature of contemporary markets, including cross-asset contagion effects, multimodal data integration, and the need for interpretable decision-making that complies with regulatory transparency requirements. To address these challenges, we propose Sleipnir, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that replaces monolithic architectures with a debate-driven ensemble of heterogeneous agents powered by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek-Reasoning). To establish a scalable and interpretable automated investment system, our framework 1) introduces an Interface Module for orchestrating multi-agent collaboration via strategic leader-follower coordination, 2) deploys a Dynamic Router for intelligent agent selection based on market conditions and query complexity, 3) integrates a ReAct Module to deliver tool-augmented analytical capabilities, and 4) implements a Reflect Module that enables interpretable decision tracing through atomic operation decomposition. Furthermore, the system incorporates a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that dynamically correlates macro-level news events with micro-level trading patterns, supporting minute-level market responsiveness. Our framework delivers three principal advances: 1) a multi-agent collaborative architecture that combines consensus-driven decision-making with specialized investment perspectives, 2) a RAG-enhanced real-time intelligence engine equipped with time-adaptive retrieval mechanisms, and 3) an interpretable decision-tracing system that provides transparent, auditable reasoning paths while ensuring regulatory compliance. Comprehensive evaluation across NIO stock (a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index (2024), high-frequency Bitcoin (BTC) trading data, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and diverse investor profiles demonstrates substantial improvements: 38.7% Sharpe ratio enhancement, reduced maximum drawdown, and superior diversification. In cryptocurrency trading, the framework achieved 0.67% returns versus 0.35% buy-and-hold with -0.82% maximum drawdown, while reducing computational costs and providing confidence-calibrated allocation strategies. These enhancements demonstrate the framework’s potential to serve as a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution that bridges theoretical economic models with practical investment implementation, supporting automated investment management across diverse market conditions.

There are few IoT systems in the present literature that are focused on monitoring and management of COPD patients, but they are not focused on the vast amount of data that IoT generates in a large scale deployment, and the integration of Smart City services. For these reasons, this paper presents an innovative system based on Cloud Computing and Big Data technologies to integrate Smart City services into a large scale scenario. To do so, this system proposes a Big Data architecture based on Apache Spark libraries to provide data integration, storage, descriptive and predictive analysis. Also, the system provides a web interface application where users can visualize the data analysis results. They show that the data enrichment function performed on the Big Data architecture provides more information about the environment to improve decisionmaking.

To this purpose, we propose a novel Occupancy Grid (OG) mapping framework, based on an adaptation to the standard OG method. The method iteratively builds an OG map from successive acoustic measurements. The resulting maps, produced in real-time by each robot, show the probability of each grid cell containing a target. The algorithm is designed to handle the presence of multiple targets and takes into account a dynamic world (moving targets). Albeit generic, the proposed method was adapted to work with passive sonar sensors that produce bearing-only measurements. Results from simulations demonstrate the capability of the method to create maps showing regions likely containing targets. They also show how data fusion between maps produced with sensors spatially separated can achieve target localisation and tracking. The produced OG maps provide valuable guidance for robot cooperative decision making. They identify interesting areas to survey (higher target presence probability), regions likely empty and areas not adequately monitored.","","978-1-7281-1450-7","10.1109/OCEANSE.2019.8867152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8867152","Occupancy Grid Mapping;Passive sonar;Underwater gliders;Multi-robot autonomy;Autonomous Underwater Vehicle;Underwater Surveillance.","Sonar;Standards;Robot sensing systems;Bayes methods;Surveillance","","18","","20","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","17-20 June 2019","17-20 June 2019","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Robust prognosis within well defined uncertainty bounds promises the ability to lower system sustainment costs and improve maintenance decision making. In ideal scenarios, the degradation of many assets is predictable from measurements taken during operation. These measurements, accompanied by appropriate knowledge, have been successfully used with various prognostic trending and prediction techniques to estimate the remaining useful life. However, there are scenarios where changes in operating environment or emerging fault modes can alter the degradation path an asset takes and thus invalidate previous predictions. One approach to overcoming these challenges is to develop prognostic techniques sensitive to change, however this sensitivity must be traded for robustness to imperfect degradation measurements. As an alternative, we develop multiple predictors, each with differing properties so that multiple estimates can be made based on different possible scenarios. A data fusion architecture is presented that combines multiple prognostic techniques weighted by their individual prediction uncertainty for the remaining useful life of an asset. The architecture is based on the concept of an ensemble Kalman Filter with an adaptive error co-variance parameter. The parameter is updated in real-time with the prediction variances produced by the set of prognostic predictions. Using real civil aerospace data, the technique is demonstrated to provide an amalgamated estimate of RUL to a fleet management operator. The developed architecture provides improved decision support to fleet maintainers in comparison to existing single prognostic technique methods.","1095-323X","978-1-4799-1622-1","10.1109/AERO.2014.6836267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836267","","Trajectory;Kalman filters;Degradation;Noise;Data models;Mathematical model;Predictive models","","5","","29","IEEE","19 Jun 2014","1-8 March 2014","1-8 March 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Dynamic Weighted Multimodal Financial Forecasting Models: Fusion Strategies and Market Validation","D. Yue","Business School, Xiamen Institute of Technology, Fujian, China","2025 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Internet and Digital Economy (ICAID)","17 Jun 2025","2025","","","60","66","The complexity and multi-source heterogeneous nature of financial markets pose challenges to traditional prediction models, where a critical challenge lies in effectively integrating multi-modal data and dynamically capturing the evolution of market states. Addressing the limitations of existing financial prediction models that rely on static weighting or singlemodal data, this paper proposes a Dynamic Weighting Multimodal Fusion (DWMF) framework. The model introduces an attention mechanism-based dynamic weighting allocation module to analyze real-time information contributions from multi-modal data, including market volatility, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic events. It adaptively adjusts fusion weights of different modalities in time-series forecasting. Furthermore, adversarial training strategies are incorporated to enhance feature representation robustness, while Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are employed to capture cross-modal temporal dependencies. Empirical studies on the A-share and U.S. stock markets validate the framework through multi-scenario tests using the CSI 300 Index, S&P 500 constituent stocks, and social media sentiment data. Results demonstrate that compared to static fusion models and single-modal benchmarks, DWMF reduces prediction errors by an average of $25.4 \%$, improves the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) by $\mathbf{3 8. 5 \%}$, and exhibits superior robustness during extreme market fluctuations. Additionally, a coupling effect is identified between enhanced pricing efficiency and volatility suppression, with the model achieving $83 \%$ of information pricing within one hour following a policy shock. This study establishes a dynamic decision-making paradigm for multi-modal financial data fusion, while its modular architecture demonstrates scalability for cross-market and cross-asset prediction tasks.","","979-8-3315-1066-4","10.1109/ICAID65275.2025.11034630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11034630","Dynamic weighting;Multi-modal finance;Fusion forecasting","Training;Adaptation models;Social networking (online);Biological system modeling;Pricing;Predictive models;Data models;Robustness;Forecasting;Stock markets","","2","","25","IEEE","17 Jun 2025","25-27 April 2025","25-27 April 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the current infrastructure will not be able to handle the massive volume of data that will be generated by these devices, hence a new paradigm known as Fog Computing has been proposed. Fog computing extends the cloud platform model by providing computing resources at the edge of the network which results in better performance. However, researchers have raised challenges such as security and privacy, which arise from IoT-based Fog computing environments. Although technologies and solutions enabling connectivity and data delivery are growing rapidly, not enough attention has been given to the security of these computing paradigms and the associated IoT devices. Hence, this paper investigates and compare Fog Orchestrators that enable security in fog computing and further investigate the security techniques used in IoT-based Fog computing environments.

Traditional sentiment analysis models often struggle with understanding the nuanced and context-dependent nature of social media posts, which are typically short, informal, and laden with slang, emojis, and abbreviations. To address these challenges, this research proposes a Context-Aware Sentiment Analysis model leveraging a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN) integrated with an Attention Mechanism. The BiRNN captures dependencies in both forward and backward sequences, effectively learning the contextual flow of information. The attention mechanism further enhances model interpretability by focusing on the most informative words contributing to sentiment classification. The proposed model was trained and evaluated on benchmark datasets such as Twitter Sentiment140 and SemEval 2017 Task 4A, achieving an accuracy of 89.6% and F1-score of 88.2% on Sentiment140, and 86.4% accuracy with an F1-score of 85.1% on SemEval, outperforming baseline methods including unidirectional RNNs and CNN-based models by a margin of 4-6% in F1-score. Visualization of attention weights provided insights into how the model emphasizes contextually significant words and phrases, improving interpretability for end-users. The model also demonstrated robustness against noisy and ambiguous data prevalent in social media streams. This context-aware framework holds significant potential for applications in brand monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and social event detection, contributing to more precise sentiment insights and enhancing real-time decision-making on social platforms.

The scheme collects real-time data streams from digital sensors and devices to construct unified DT records for intelligent analytics and decision-making. The scheme integrates lightweight searchable encryption with blockchain-based trapdoor delegation and ciphertext-level indexing, enabling secure and low-complexity keyword matching.

Existing insulin dosing models based solely on electronic health records (EHR) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data fail to account for the effects of high-dose glucocorticoid tapering, which significantly impacts glucose control. Additionally, few platforms can seamlessly integrate structured clinical data with patient-reported inputs, limiting their utility for real-time decision-making and AIdriven insulin predictions. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-phase clinical study in collaboration with IBM and Cleveland Clinic. In phase 1, we retrospectively analyzed EHR and CGM data to examine how glucocorticoid tapering influenced insulin requirements. This analysis highlighted the need to incorporate additional factors-such as meal intake, activity levels, and sleep quality-to improve predictive modeling. In phase 2, we developed a customized Health Guardian (HG) web application to collect patient-reported measures. We also refined t he HG data pipeline to integrate EHR, CGM, and patient-reported data into a centralized PostgreSQL database, enabling realtime visualization through both clinician and patient interfaces.

These services are extents across various industries and applications, enhancing efficiency and decision-making through real-time data collection and analysis. In IoT services, authentication ensures that devices, users, and systems verify every other's individuality. It process is critical for establishing secure and trusted connections, preventing unauthorized access by malicious users. Context-aware authentication for IoT services improves security by incorporating contextual information during the authentication process. Hybridization of Segmented Regressive Signcryption and Extreme Learning Authentication (HSRS-ELA) Model proposed to enhance the security of context-sensitive IoT services with higher confidentiality and integrity. The proposed HSRS-ELM method includes four major processes. Initially, user information and web service lists are collected from the dataset. Via IoT device, user broadcast request toward cloud server. The server computes the priority of the request using a segmented regression function. High-priority requests are then served first than the others. For each user, a Congruential ephemeral key generation process is carried out to generate private and public keys. Next, the signcryption process is executed, which combines encryption and digital signature generation. For ensuring secure transmission, encrypted service information as well as signature convey toward receiver. The extreme learning machine (ELM) is then applied to verify both the signature and the context information of the users in the authentication process. If the verification is successful, the server grants access to the requested web services. Otherwise, the server denies access to the user. Finally, confidentiality and integrity is achieved during web service transmission. Experimental evaluations are conducted on metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confidentiality, integrity, computational overhead, and latency. HSRS-ELM outcome is achieved higher accuracy, confidentiality, and integrity during transmission, with minimal time consumption compared to existing methods.","","978-1-6654-5810-8","10.1109/ACROSET66531.2025.11281281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11281281","Security;Context sensitive IoT service;Signcryption;segmented regression;extreme learning machine;authentication","Accuracy;Sensitivity;Web services;Extreme learning machines;Computational modeling;Authentication;Receivers;Internet of Things;Servers;Context modeling","","","","15","IEEE","16 Dec 2025","27-28 Sept. 2025","27-28 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study constructs a data-driven research route planning framework, which integrates multi-source heterogeneous data through a Time Series Graph Neural Network (TGNN) to achieve deep correlation modeling of topic evolution, resource allocation, and achievement output. The framework design includes a four layer architecture consisting of data layer, feature engineering layer, association modeling layer, and visualization application layer. BERT semantic encoding is used to extract deep features of scientific research texts, and GraphSAGE graph convolution and temporal gating mechanism (GRU) are combined to capture spatiotemporal dynamic relationships. SHAP value analysis and critical path tracing are used to achieve transparency in the decision-making process. The experiment was based on five years of scientific research data in a certain field (12863 structured records, 5217 literature texts, and a collaborative network with 1543 nodes), and the results showed that the proposed framework was significantly better than traditional methods (SWOT analysis, ARIMA) and baseline models (GCN) in terms of trend prediction accuracy (81.3%) and link prediction accuracy (86.4%). The resource allocation error rate (MAE) was reduced by 4.7 percentage points compared to the comparative model. The analysis of feature importance reveals that the similarity of policy themes (0.32) and the strength of cross institutional cooperation (0.28) are the core influencing factors, confirming the crucial role of policy orientation and research network structure in planning decisions. Research breaks through the static modeling bottleneck of traditional methods, constructs a planning system that combines prediction accuracy and interpretability, and provides a new path for data intensive scientific research paradigms.

Within this broad concept, the Industrial Metaverse is particularly significant as it revolutionizes industrial processes through real-time data integration, predictive main-tenance, and advanced simulations, thereby boosting efficiency, reducing costs, and fostering innovation in manufacturing and supply chain management. However, the reliance on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices introduces significant cyber threats, as these devices often have minimal security measures and can serve as entry points for attackers. Therefore, the security of the Industrial Metaverse is crucial, requiring sophisticated protection mechanisms to safeguard against these evolving cyber threats and ensure the integrity of industrial operations. Furthermore, the transparency of these protection systems is vital for the effective reporting and managing of such attacks. To address the specific security needs of the Industrial Metaverse environment, a White-Box style Intrusion Detection System (IDS) model has been introduced, integrated into the Metaverse through the use of avatars. This model gives promising result as F1-micro of 0.95, reaching the performance of the best existing black-box model in the literature.

One of the main barriers to its full implementation is the lack of interoperable and automated inspection systems capable of detecting errors and enabling data feedback, with the potential for integration into closed-loop control systems. This article presents an integrated approach for the dimensional and geometric inspection of parts produced by additive manufacturing, combining a UR5e collaborative robot with a machine vision system. The proposed solution features an open architecture, is low-cost, and can operate directly in the production environment, reducing human intervention during the measurement process. The system performs both dimensional and geometric inspections on the same machine, leveraging the robot’s communication interfaces, control capabilities, and sensors to feed acquired data into a process control algorithm. Two evaluation strategies are presented: the first, based on machine vision, performs dimensional measurements and introduces a novel approach for parameterizing errors in printed corners using area-based analysis and linear regression; the second, based on the UR5e, performs contact-based inspection of geometric characteristics such as circularity, parallelism, and perpendicularity. The system achieved a standard deviation of 0.0378 mm and can generate indicators such as the Filling Quality Index (FQI), Non-Printed Area Index (NPAI), and Unnecessary Printed Regions (INR).

The mapping process entails Sentinel-2 multispectral (10-20 m) data (level 2 processed) and Landsat-8 OLI data integrated in GEE with cloud masking and radiometric calibration as preprocessing steps.

At its core is the sensing-to-action loop, which iteratively aligns sensor inputs with computational models to drive adaptive control strategies. These loops can adapt to hyper-local conditions, enhancing resource efficiency and responsiveness, but also face challenges such as resource constraints, synchronization delays in multimodal data fusion, and the risk of cascading errors in feedback loops. This article explores how proactive, context-aware sensing-to-action and action-to-sensing adaptations can enhance efficiency by dynamically adjusting sensing and computation based on task demands, such as sensing a very limited part of the environment and predicting the rest. By guiding sensing through control actions, action-to-sensing pathways can improve task relevance and resource use, but they also require robust monitoring to prevent cascading errors and maintain reliability. Multi-agent sensing-action loops further extend these capabilities through coordinated sensing and actions across distributed agents, optimizing resource use via collaboration. Additionally, neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological systems, provides an efficient framework for spike-based, event-driven processing that conserves energy, reduces latency, and supports hierarchical control-making it ideal for multi-agent optimization. This article highlights the importance of end-to-end co-design strategies that align algorithmic models with hardware and environmental dynamics, improve cross-layer inter-dependencies to improve throughput, precision, and adaptability for energy-efficient edge autonomy in complex environments.","1558-1101","978-3-9826741-0-0","10.23919/DATE64628.2025.10993258","NSF(grant numbers:2329096,2106964,2317974); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10993258","Edge computing;sensing-to-action loops;autonomous systems;neuromorphic computing;multi-agent systems;spike-based processing;energy-efficient architectures;hardware-software co-design;adaptive control;machine learning","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Robot sensing systems;Energy efficiency;Sensors;Computational efficiency;Synchronization;Reliability;Vehicle dynamics;Edge computing","","","","78","","21 May 2025","31 March-2 April 2025","31 March-2 April 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The growth of the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid development of technologies such as short range mobile communication and improved energy-efficiency is expected to create a pervasive connection of “things.” This will inevitably result in the generation of enormous amount of data, which have to be stored, processed, and accessed. Cloud computing has long been recognized as a paradigm for big data storage and analytics. The combination of cloud computing and IoT can enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual things, thus stimulating innovations in both fields. For example, cloud platforms allow the sensing data to be stored and used intelligently for smart monitoring and actuation with the smart devices. Novel data fusion algorithms, machine learning methods, and artificial intelligence techniques can be implemented and run centralized or distributed on the cloud to achieve automated decision making. These will boost the development of new applications, such as smart cities, grids, and transportation systems. New challenges, however, arise when IoT meets cloud—there is an urgent need for novel network architectures that seamlessly integrate them, and protocols that facilitate big data streaming from IoT to the cloud. QoS and QoE, as well as data security, privacy, and reliability, are critical concerns during the integration.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2554738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7467613","","Special issues and sections;Cloud computing;Embedded systems;Sensors;Data analysis;Actuators;Energy efficiency;Cyber-physical systems","","3","","","IEEE","10 May 2016","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Systems for early warning, command and control, and decision-making have been successfully implemented in many countries and regions all over the world. Many of these systems can meet requirements for early warning and real-time response, and provide suitable models for elaborated predictions, simulations and visualizations. However, some new paradigms such as 3D modelling and semantics are still insufficiently addressed. It is expected that 3D models can greatly improve situational awareness and enhance spatial analysis and simulations. Appropriate vocabularies and semantics to enrich the spatial information are extremely beneficial in data integration and sharing of information at national and international level as well as for developing of context aware applications. This talk will make an overview on systems for emergency response and will present results of systems based on semantically enriched 3D models.","","978-1-4799-4767-6","10.1109/ICT-DM.2014.6917780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6917780","","Educational institutions;Earthquakes;Computers;Teamwork;Emergency services;Three-dimensional displays","","","","","IEEE","9 Oct 2014","24-25 March 2014","24-25 March 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
