Data processing and communication to the user end of the vast amount of data degrades the system performance. Data fusion is a technique that produces the output that represents the information from the multiple sources. This output helps in the decision-making process more efficiently.

This model accurately detects hostile military personnel in darkness, smoke, and adverse weather. The detection outputs are georeferenced and passed to an Agent AI module that uses reinforcement learning for real time threat detection, prioritization, and mission adaptation, thereby reducing operator workload and response time. At the same time, every image, detection, and AI decision is immutably recorded on Pure Chain, a lightweight blockchain employing Smart Auto Mining Plus(SAM+) and a Proof of Authority and Association (PoA2) consensus mechanism to secure peer-to-peer transactions in under three seconds. Performance evaluation confirms robust detection, low latency decision making, and tamper-proof data integrity.

In safety-critical sectors, maintaining situational awareness is essential for performance and error prevention. Situational awareness (SAW) is crucial for the success of activities in many different domains, such as surveillance, humanitarian aid, and search and rescue efforts. SAW is however susceptible to enemy attacks. By giving users enhanced coverage, it increases survivability and mission capability. Recently, Smart gadgets used data to address crisis scenarios and provide real-time tracking to protect law enforcement personnel out in the field. Despite these developments, it might be challenging for first responders to get a precise feel of their surroundings due to an abundance of field data. Security teams need to be able to quickly transform this data into actionable intelligence using a few instruments at their disposal, including body cameras, fingerprint scanners, and facial recognition software. Officers can cut through the noise to acquire actual real-time situational awareness by integrating heterogeneous information into a cohesive platform. Therefore, the proposed work examines potential mitigation measures while considering hostile threats and assaults against SAW systems. Additionally, information and alarms can be instantly sent between operators and field officers using vital interface features. The optimization of the AutoML system is proposed for fusion of sensor data. AutoML classification with Bayesian and ASHA (Asynchronous successive halving algorithm) is used for situational forecasting and decision-making awareness, IoT is used to monitor data gathered from Kaggle and sensor readings, while thingspeak cloud is used to monitor sensor output.","","978-1-6654-5627-2","10.1109/ICAIA57370.2023.10169306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10169306","Sensors;Thing speak;IoT;Cloud monitoring;situation awareness;Real-time tracking;AutoML","Surveillance;Decision making;Transforms;Sensor fusion;Real-time systems;Software;Classification algorithms","","1","","23","IEEE","6 Jul 2023","21-22 April 2023","21-22 April 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Command by intent is a paradigm that empowers subordinate units to exercise measured initiative to meet mission goals and accept prudent risk within commander's intent. It improves agility of military operations by allowing exploitation of local opportunities without an explicit directive from the commander to do so. This paper discusses what the paradigm entails in terms of architectural decisions for data fusion systems tasked with real-time information collection to satisfy operational mission goals. In our system, information needs of decisions are expressed at a high level, and shared among relevant nodes. The selected nodes, then, jointly operate to meet mission information needs by forwarding and caching relevant data without explicit directives regarding the objects to fetch and sources to contact. A preliminary evaluation of the system is presented using a target tracking application, set in the context of a NATO-based mission scenario, called Anglova. Evaluation results show that delegating some decision authority to the data fusion system (in terms of objects to fetch and sources to contact) allows it to save more network resources, while also increasing mission success rate. The system is therefore particularly well-suited to operation in partially denied or contested environments, where resource bottlenecks caused by adversarial activity impair one's ability to collect real-time information for mission-critical decision making.","","978-0-9964527-6-2","10.23919/ICIF.2018.8455376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8455376","IoBT;Command-by-intent;Decision-centric","Decision trees;Data integration;Sensor systems;Prefetching;Bandwidth;Sensor fusion","","2","","14","","6 Sep 2018","10-13 July 2018","10-13 July 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary results include enhanced situational awareness and improvements in fire control, engagement support, operational planning, combat reaction times, threat prioritization, and the list continues. Bettering the use of sensors and weapons in concert with one another- effectively creating a system of distributed systems-provides major payoffs. The effectiveness of managing distributed resources depends on the ability to make complex decisions. The complexity is due in part to the circuitous nature of fusing data from multiple sensor sources to provide a representation of the operational environment from which to redirect sensors for further information optimization and from which to base military operations. The ""goodness"" of such complex decisions depends on the ""goodness"" of the information available and the understanding of the situation from a ""big picture"" perspective.

We conduct an extensive set of experiments to demonstrate that FogSurv using AI and data fusion help provide near real-time inferences and SA. Experimental results demonstrate that FogSurv provides a latency improvement of 37% on average over cloud architectures for the selected benchmarks. Results further indicate that combining AI with data fusion as in FogSurv can provide a speedup of up to  $9.8\times $  over AI without data fusion while also maintaining or improving the inference accuracy.

This paper introduces the Self-Explaining Decision Architecture (SEDA) for ML-based decision-making systems capable of generating intuitive explanations for their decisions in real time. SEDA makes use of a feature extraction subsystem and a sequence interpretation subsystem to identify patterns in data followed by a decision generation subsystem that determines appropriate actions based on those patterns. Internal state information from each of these subsystems is used to generate explanations of the system’s decisions. Using this information to create explanations provides insight as to the data elements the system focused on when making decisions as well as the reasoning that was used.

However, there is one major and critical difference between terrorist acts and the other types of disruptions: the terrorist acts are willful - and therefore also adaptive. One must counter these acts with the same, if not more sophisticated, willful, adaptive and informed approach. Real-time, information-based decision making or decision informatics is the approach advanced herein to help make the right decisions at the various stages of a disruption.

Gauging population sentiment for targeted response areas and having the ability to predict or control sentiment within these areas is invaluable. Review of reception towards deployed forces must be analyzed, especially in areas vital for U.S. national interests. Predicting population behavior is critical for success and must include a qualitative as well as a quantitative solution. Additionally, a feedback mechanism is needed for periodically updating reception towards presence of U.S. Forces over time. We propose a method for predicting sentiment towards deployed U.S. Forces in near real time, to efficiently propitiate manpower resources, allocate equipment assets, and reduce cost of analyses. Sentiment prediction is becoming an increasingly important and feasible task based on social media, open source data, physical imagery and abundance of video data feeds. Predicting reaction to events can be time consuming. Locating the most likely affected areas is very tedious, requiring much human labor effort, and it is often difficult to obtain the best information on a timely basis. An efficient tool would be helpful to rapidly parse text that has been extracted from an intelligent algorithm in order to evaluate the population sentiment for the targeted area. Multiple data inputs and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are required in order to support sound decision making theory.

AR-enabled productive spaces can connect virtual overlays with the user's real-world, overlaying relevant data directly into his/her field of view. But this smooth transition also presents major cybersecurity issues. Real-time AR data overlays that, in many scenarios, are wirelessly transmitted, are vulnerable to interception, manipulation and injection of adverse content by adversaries. These kinds of cyberattacks can result in data leaks, disruption to operations, or even health risks for personnel in mission-critical situations like factory floors, medical procedures or out in the field. A multitiered cybersecurity framework for safeguarding AR- enabled spaces from interception and tampering of real-time data overlays is proposed in this research. The cure uses encrypted data streaming, zero-trust network architecture, AI-based anomaly detection and handshake authentication. Encrypted communication paths, seeded with dynamic key exchange, guarantee against undue eavesdropping of transmitted overlays. Zero-trust guidelines allow for the dynamic authentication of both devices and users to protect against unauthorized access of AR streams AI-driven threat detection observes the flow of data in real-time to identify any abnormal behavior patterns, such as surprising overlay changes or suspicious traffic. Integrity verification mechanisms, deployed at the edge, cross-verify the data authenticity prior to rendering it on the user code naveen s3 s device, preventing the delivery of tampered content. The proposed framework was tested with a simulated AR environment which fuses collaborative CAD modelling, live IoT sensor feed and remote expert facility. Several hypothetical cyberattack models including the man-in-the- middle (MITM) interception, overlay injection and replay attacks were reproduced. The experimental results show that the proposed CGI can detect overlay manipulation attacks with a detection rate of 94.5% and prevent interception 98% of times with no visible delay in rendering ($<30 ~\text{ms}$). This research reveals the pressing requirement for strong cyber- defense within AR work environments, which are quickly expanding from niche applications to enterprise standards. This approach can protect real-time AR content against disclosure, alteration, and denial of service-related threats on both network level and application level.

"FraudFusion: A Multi-Modal Ensemble Framework for Anomaly-Based Fraud Detection in Retail POS Systems","L. N. Mishra; B. Senapati","Lowe’s, Mooresville, NC, USA; Department of Computer Science, UALR, Little Rock, AR, USA",IEEE Access,"23 Jan 2026","2026","14","","10436","10456","Fraudulent activities targeting retail Point-of-Sale (POS) systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated and surpassing the capabilities of predominant rule-based or single-modal machine learning model-based defense mechanisms, as they struggle to capture the complex and evolving fraudulent activity patterns. As a result, the digital economy is experiencing a growing concern originating from increasing financial losses based on fraudulent activities at retail POS systems. This paper presents FraudFusion, a novel multi-modal ensemble learning explainable framework designed to enhance fraud detection in retail POS environments. It fuses transactional, device telemetry, and behavioral context into a unified vector that ensures defense against a wide range of fraudulent attempts. A novel Context-Aware Dynamic Modality Weighting (CADMW) mechanism has been introduced in this framework that dynamically adjusts learner contributions per transaction based on real-time modality relevance. Besides, a unique combination of context-aware pruning and quantization further optimizes the system response and resource utilization for edge devices, making it an appropriate solution for resource-constrained environments. The application of the FraudFusion framework on real-world retail transactions demonstrates an impressive fraudulent activity detection accuracy of 94.9%. The precision, recall, and F1-score values are 94.2%, 94.8%, and 94.5%, respectively. With 41.9% CPU resources and 148 MB RAM, it responds in real-time with only 72.6 ms latency. Moreover, it demonstrates resilience to a wide range of adversarial attacks through Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples. Most importantly, it is an explainable system, which is essential for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the financial sector. In a nutshell, the FraudFusion framework is an interpretable, scalable, and optimized solution equipped with advanced capabilities to detect next-generation fraudulent activities at retail POS systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2026.3655398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11357914","Fraud detection;multi-modal learning;point-of-sale systems;anomaly detection;ensemble learning;context-aware systems;edge computing;explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);adversarial robustness;out-of-distribution detection;retail cybersecurity;real-time analytics","Fraud;Real-time systems;Image edge detection;Anomaly detection;Telemetry;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence;Robustness;Ensemble learning;Finance","","","","58","CCBY","19 Jan 2026","2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve the hidden terminal problem, collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS), which benifits from spatial diversity, has been studied intensively in CR networks. For current CSS schemes, secondary users (SUs) are generally assumed to send sensing information honestly, however, misbehaved SUs may report false sensing data to mislead and compromise the system, which is called spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. In order to defense against malicious SSDF attacks, certain evidence-theory-based secure sensing approaches have been proposed. However, in most of the current evidence-theory-based CSS schemes, only real-time evidence information is utilized to estimate the sensing reliability of cognitive users, like the difference in SNR or similarity degree. Inadequate consideration causes CSS system being vulnerable to SSDF attacks, and the correctness of global decision making cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a credible CSS scheme based on evidence theory. It evaluates the credibility of each SU with two indexes, which are the statistical reputation factor and the real-time reliability factor, respectively. In addition, considering the transmitted data rises with the number of SUs increasing, we propose a rational mass distribution (RMD) approach to adjust evidence theory to binary hypothesis test in spectrum sensing context. As a consequence, both the data volume to be transmitted and the workload at data fusion center has been reduced. Simulation results have proved that the proposed scheme is effective and robust to defense against distinctive SSDF attack patterns.","","978-1-5386-1211-8","10.1109/PIERS-FALL.2017.8293109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293109","","Sensors;Cascading style sheets;Reliability;Real-time systems;Electromagnetics;Collaboration;Cognitive radio","","","","12","IEEE","19 Feb 2018","19-22 Nov. 2017","19-22 Nov. 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved through multi-year, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts—in terms of new capabilities—in constant investment decision planning cycles, costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this automation evolution vision for ANSPs.This paper examines the migration from today’s systems to secure, cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations, like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that must be considered for this evolution.","2155-7209","978-1-6654-3420-1","10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9594313","Automation;ATM;Cloud-native;Microservices","Automation;Costs;Online banking;Clouds;Safety;Stakeholders;Security","","3","","7","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","3-7 Oct. 2021","3-7 Oct. 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, the maintenance of maglev trains is shifting from traditional planned maintenance to preventive maintenance. It is necessary to study how to scientifically and efficiently achieve the maintenance of maglev vehicle equipment to ensure the safe and reliable operation of maglev trains and improve economic benefits. This article aims to establish a scientific magnetic levitation train maintenance management information system using a Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) strategy, which balances both economy and practicality. Firstly, based on Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMECA), an RCM logical decision-making method is proposed for identifying reasonable maintenance modes. By categorizing failure levels to assess their impact, an optimized maintenance strategy for magnetic levitation trains is proposed. By establishing an economic benefit evaluation model and considering the characteristics of remote maintenance and RCM analysis data requirements for magnetic levitation trains, a data warehouse is used as the basic tool for data storage, sharing, analysis, and application. The constructed remote maintenance data warehouse system for magnetic levitation trains can realize functions such as monitoring data query, visualization, and real-time warning of service status, providing decision-making references for the maintenance of the magnetic levitation train system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2026.3661089","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52432012,52332011,2023JJ20053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11372658","Information management system;maintenance management;data warehouse;reliability;maglev train","Maintenance;Magnetic levitation vehicles;Reliability;Preventive maintenance;Reliability engineering;Maintenance management;Data warehouses;Monitoring;Costs;Safety","","","","31","CCBYNCND","6 Feb 2026","2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the urban terrain, for example, warfighter survivability, lethality and operational effectiveness are directly related to the quality of situational awareness (SA), which is based on essential elements of information (EEIs) that currently flow down through radio communications with the commander and analysts. EEIs represent information regarding the enemy and environment critical to a given operational mission and are based on intelligence gathered from either battlefield sensing assets or other HUMINT. As battle and mission objectives change, initial information provided to the warfighter in the form of pre-operational intelligence become quickly obsolete. In this paper, we present an overall design premise for improving warfighter SA while minimizing cognitive overload. We consider both an overall architecture for auto-discovery and federation of warfighters and sensing assets, and the necessary additions to warfighter perceptual channels needed to make such a system feasible. Finally, we suggest design concepts for a wearable technology that will provide the warfighter with real-time, context dependant SA","1095-323X","0-7803-9545-X","10.1109/AERO.2006.1656053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656053","","Radio communication;Information analysis;Electrostatic precipitators;Decision making;Stress;Semantic Web;Protocols;Biographies;Humans","","","","12","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","4-11 March 2006","4-11 March 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
