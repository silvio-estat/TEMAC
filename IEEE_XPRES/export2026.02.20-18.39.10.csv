The approach is based on the deployment of multi-layered & semantically enabled Data Lakes for storing various maritime data collected from heterogeneous sensors, and on the information exchange process through the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) network using advanced Command and Control (C2) platforms. The results of this paper are derived from the EU-funded project EFFECTOR, highlighting the significant contribution of advanced solutions using Artificial Intelligence algorithms and supporting UAV and C2 technologies to various operations at sea. The validation survey results collected from end-users after the execution of the maritime trials are presented as well.","","978-1-6654-7273-9","10.1109/TELFOR56187.2022.9983697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9983697","Big Data;Data Lake;CISE;UAV;Maritime C2","Command and control systems;Surveillance;Process control;Big Data applications;Market research;Safety;Telecommunications","","3","","22","IEEE","22 Dec 2022","15-16 Nov. 2022","15-16 Nov. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"27 First Line of Defense for Cybersecurity: AI","A. Banafa",NA,Quantum Computing and Other Transformative Technologies,"","2022","","","135","142","This book explores quantum computing as a transformative technology and its applications in communications, cryptography, teleportation, IoT, AI, and blockchain, in addition to the revolutionary concept of quantum internet. It also explains the concept of dark, small, thick data, and clarifies what the concept of a data lake. Other exciting technologies like edge/fog computing, CDN, SDN, wearable technology and IoE topics are discussed in details in the book. Information security applications like zero trust model, zero-day vulnerability and heuristic analysis, and use of AI in cybersecurity are explored. Two of the most intriguing concepts in computing “affective computing” and “autonomic computing” are explained and simplified. The blockchain applications presented include blockchain and supply chain, crowdsourcing, cryptocurrency, and IoT. The book ends with a look at using technology to fight COVID-19 and future pandemics.","","9788770226837","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9933598.pdf&bkn=9933493&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","31 Oct 2022","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"
