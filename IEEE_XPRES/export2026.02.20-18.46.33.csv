One of the problems attached to traditional data lakes is the difficulty of retrieving data, which is slow to query, inefficiently, and with high complexities of schema evolution the ability of the data lake to optimize workloads dynamically. To overcome these problems, the work presented in this paper brings forward the concept of an AI-optimized data lake framework that exploits machine learning and deep learning for intelligent data ingestion, adaptive indexing as well as self-optimizing query execution. The system is proposed to incorporate hierarchical storage management with AI-driven, self-studying indexing mechanisms, and reinforcement learning-aided query optimization to improve data retrieval efficiency. Furthermore, through an integrated AI-powered anomaly detection system, data processing is made robust and reliable in real time. On top of that the framework also involves autonomous governance and security that can use explainable AI for compliance auditing and a dynamic role-based access control (RBAC). Experimental evaluations show that, with up to a 90% time saving, and with real-time decision-making capabilities, it improves over both aspects in a variety of data workloads.

Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (T&E) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the T&E community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.The true product of T&E is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the T&E community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during T&E. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace. The net result of these commercial best practices is a solid foundation for the DoD to transform how it uses data to achieve faster, better, and smarter decisions throughout the acquisition lifecycle.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622388","Big Data;Data Analytics;Knowledge Management;Data Management;Virtualization;Cloud Computing;Predictive Maintainance;Department of Defense;Test and Evaluation","Big Data;Knowledge management;Tools;US Department of Defense;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Data analysis","","5","","0","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","10-13 Dec. 2018","10-13 Dec. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The modern data stack introduces flexibility and tool diversity, while cloud-native platforms redefine scalability and simplify integration. Yet, selecting the appropriate stack remains a complex task, as most prior research focuses on isolated components rather than holistic, practical comparisons. This paper addresses that gap by evaluating three prevalent data architecture paradigms: Hadoop, Modern, and Cloud-Based stacks. We conduct a thorough end-to-end comparison across the full big data value chain, from ingestion to visualization. Moreover, beyond architectural assessment, we implement each stack on a real-world scenario using the Amazon Books Reviews dataset where each implementation is evaluated based on key metrics such as scalability, performance, ease, and deployment costs.

The data are stored in a Data Warehouse (DW) that is periodically built from a data lake. Depending on the needs of the decision-maker, data are extracted from the DW and transferred to a Data Mart (DM) for querying. In this paper, we present a schema recommendation system based on the principle of collaborative filtering. This system can predict the DM schemas that were developed in the past that best match the data need expressed by a decision-maker. It does this by comparing the attributes present in the schemas with the attributes deduced from the need to propose a list of predictions for the most suitable schemas.

By using the big data technologies that enable efficient data processing, the value of the data increases, as these technologies can turn the data into actionable information that influences important decision-making processes. However, a broader view of the operational environment, an investigated phenomena, and challenges related to them can frequently be obtained after combining data from many data sets located in various big data lakes. This requires contact points in both data lakes that must be flexibly joined because in many cases, data sets do not correspond to one another directly. In this paper, we show fuzzy join operation for flexible combining big data lakes. The fuzzy join transforms numerical values of common attributes of joined data sets into fuzzy sets and uses such a representation in the join operation. We propose two variants of the join operation that transforms crisp numerical values of joining attributes into: 1) fuzzy numbers and 2) linguistic terms. The fuzzy join operation is implemented and tested in the declarative U-SQL language that is used for scalable and parallel querying in big data lakes. The ideas presented here are exemplified by a distributed analysis of cardiac disease data on Microsoft Azure cloud. The results of the conducted experiments confirm that the fuzzy join can enrich data sets that are used in making critical decisions and, as a highly scalable cloud-based solution, can be successfully used in processing large volumes of data delivered by cyber-physical systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879829","Microsoft Research; Habilitation Grant of the Rector of the Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland(grant numbers:02/020/RGH18/0148); Statutory Research Funds of Institute of Informatics, Silesian University of Technology(grant numbers:BK/213/RAU2/2018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8525267","Cyber-physical systems;big data;fuzzy logic;querying;cloud computing;biomedical data analysis;declarative languages","Lakes;Big Data;Cyber-physical systems;Cloud computing;Sensors;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring","","17","","51","CCBY","6 Nov 2018","2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing ETL systems struggle with performance, scalability, and adaptability, making it difficult to handle the rising demands of both batch and real-time data processing. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Hybrid ETL Infrastructure that combines contextual data partitioning with AI-driven orchestration to optimize data ingestion and real-time analysis in information lakehouses. The system addresses key issues, such as inefficient data handling, slow processing times, and inadequate transformation methods, by dynamically adjusting the ETL pipeline based on user requests, context-aware partitioning, and data characteristics. The AI-driven orchestration ensures efficient job scheduling by seamlessly switching between batch and real-time processing based on data importance, thereby improving both performance and flexibility. Contextual partitioning reduces processing costs and enhances query performance by automatically organizing data according to domain-specific knowledge and query intent. The primary goal of this framework is to improve data transformation and loading performance in information lakehouses, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making. Preliminary results show a 30% reduction in ETL processing time and significant improvements in query efficiency and accuracy, particularly in complex, cross-domain data retrieval environments. The proposed approach offers a scalable, adaptable, and intelligent solution for modern data lakehouse scenarios, outperforming traditional ETL methods.","2643-8615","979-8-3315-3893-4","10.1109/ISPCC66872.2025.11039601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11039601","Hybrid ETL Framework;Data Lakehouse;AI-Driven Orchestration;Contextual Data Partitioning;Real-Time Processing;Data Ingestion;Batch Processing;Data Transformation;Query Optimization;Scalable Data Architecture","Data ingestion;Accuracy;Scalability;Computer architecture;Transforms;Switches;Signal processing;Real-time systems;Scheduling;Service-oriented architecture","","","","21","IEEE","24 Jun 2025","6-8 March 2025","6-8 March 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, our customers will ask to store and process massive log message data to support their real-time and decision-making applications. Thus, we need computation and storage components in the analytic platform to process and store these data cost-efficiently. To meet these user requirements, we have designed a storage system in data lake, StreamLake, which introduces a novel design to serve log message streaming and batch data processing in distributed storage, with high scalability, efficiency, reliability and low cost. Specifically, we introduce a stream (storage) object as a storage abstraction for message streaming data to achieve the storage-disaggregated architecture with high scalability and reliability. Moreover, we utilize the erasure coding and tiered storage to save the storage cost, and furthermore, the stream object can be automatically converted to a table object such that cost-effective stream and batch data processing can be achieved. For tabular data, we implement the lakehouse functionality to support ACID via the table object, with a metadata acceleration to improve the efficiency of data access between the compute and storage engines. Also, we design a LakeBrain optimizer at the storage side to optimize the query performance and resource utilization under the storage-disaggregated architecture. Finally, we have also deployed StreamLake in China Mobile, the world's largest mobile network operator to serve over 20PB production data, and the results demonstrate improvements of 30% to 4x in terms of query performance and over 37% in terms of cost saving.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-1715-2","10.1109/ICDE60146.2024.00386","NSFC(grant numbers:62102215,U23B2019,61925205,62232009,U23A20297,61932004,62225203,U21A20516,U2001211); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB4503600,2022YFB2702100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10598130","n/a","Costs;Scalability;Computer architecture;Production;Data processing;Big Data applications;Reliability engineering","","3","","47","IEEE","23 Jul 2024","13-16 May 2024","13-16 May 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Connected vehicle trajectory data now enables a scalable, complementary “top-down” approach for system-wide performance analysis, even for locations with no detection or communication. This paper proposes a data architecture for derived performance measures that can be used for both strategic (top-down) and tactical (bottom-up) management of traffic signals. To leverage a “top-down” approach, large amounts of data must be processed into smaller datasets. For efficiency and interoperability between performance measures and the tools used to derive the same, a scalable data management architecture is essential. This paper discusses and demonstrates a framework developed for the Indiana Department of Transportation, which contains the derived information from over 177 billion records per year for the state, covering more than 2,500 signalized intersections in just 80,000 or so rows of derived performance measures. This framework collects data using a combination of a fixed time period, date, movement, approach, and intersection identifier. The structured model of derived performance measures supports both tactical applications, such as green-time allocation, and top-down, strategic management applications such as identifying capacity-constrained signals that are candidates for capital improvements. This framework is applicable to other tools used to derive performance measures, such as high-resolution or LiDAR datasets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3635007","Joint Transportation Research Program; Indiana Department of Transportation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11258624","Big data;capability maturity framework (CMM);data architecture;intersection performance measures","Data models;Transportation;Big Data;Systematics;Soft sensors;Decision making;Capability maturity model;Pedestrians;Laser radar;Delays","","","","18","CCBY","19 Nov 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present Triage-Bot, an online medical triage provisioning service, that can revolutionize emergency care by decreasing the load on emergency departments (ED), reducing healthcare expenses, and improving the quality of care. Empowered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the Triage-Bot service assesses and prioritizes patients' needs based on symptoms, medical history, and perceived conditions from multimodal video, audio, and text data captured during patients' interactions. The captured summarized information with a severity ranking is sent to a human expert to suggest the next action on the user's part. The diverse data types used by the Triage-Bot in communication, authentication, data collection, storage, and analytics requires a robust and scalable system architecture for online service provisioning. In this paper, we specifically focus on the system design and architecture of the Triage-Bot for emergency healthcare settings. With integrated electronic medical records (EMR) and online platforms, the bot fosters collaboration among healthcare professionals and enables swift and informed decision-making even in the face of crises. By partially automating and offering a hybrid triage process, the Triage-Bot improves resource allocation, reduces healthcare management costs for emergency care, minimizes patient waiting times, and improves wellbeing. To address the complexities and demands of healthcare data management, our proposed system incorporates MongoDB database for flexibility, scalability, and versatility in supporting different types of data. Additionally, we implement a data linking and analytics pipeline utilizing a data Lakehouse system to effectively ingest, manage, process, and generate knowledge from heterogeneous data sources.","2836-3795","979-8-3503-7696-8","10.1109/COMPSAC61105.2024.00299","NSERC Canada; IBM; Mitacs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10633674","Database;Triage bot;Healthcare Management;Data Lakehouse","Hospitals;Databases;Soft sensors;Authentication;Systems architecture;Computer architecture;Chatbots","","1","","32","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","2-4 July 2024","2-4 July 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Power grids around the world have upgraded to smart grid (SG) by introducing advanced monitoring technologies such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), smart meters and Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), which collect high-resolution electrical measurements across the system. This has brought in a massive amount of data, termed big data, that needs to be efficiently processed to derive valuable insights. Specifically, technical sophistication, security, and integration of datasets are the main concerns that need to be tackled to transform the massive dataset into useful insights. This chapter surveys big data analytics (BDA) and its related benefits, challenges, and advancements in SG’s perspective. BDA in combination with visualization tools, help in the predictive decision-making process in the SG. Thus, data analytics play a significant part in the efficient monitoring of the SG. Powered with the integration of information and communication technologies, an information layer has been introduced to the traditional power systems to collect, store, and process data from smart meters and sensor implementations. Big data architecture involves data aggregation, storing, and analytics, which integrates the SG’s need for a range of frameworks with outstanding computational skills to respond to the customer’s needs. Characterization of big data, SGs, and massive volumes of data processing is first addressed as a preface to demonstrate the motivation and possible benefits of integrating advanced data mining in smart grids. Specific principles and standard data analytics techniques for general concerns are also discussed. The chapter’s key section discusses the advanced uses of various data analytics in SG, leveraging machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). SG is benefited from the inherent capacity of ML to generalize, delivering reliable and quick power flow predictions from dispersed measurement units, with superior computing performance and interoperability. The chapter explores numerous literary works that utilize various ML methods to enhance SG activity and management. We will present big data analytics and cloud infrastructure in this chapter and address their importance to SG. Specifically, we would concentrate on relevant computational concerns and solutions linked to SG cyber-physical protection and safety.","","9783110714159","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10789589.pdf&bkn=10783464&pdfType=chapter","","Big Data;Power system reliability;Monitoring;Renewable energy sources;Real-time systems;Electrical engineering;Telecommunication network reliability;Smart grids;Power system stability;Load flow","","","","","","16 Jan 2025","","","De Gruyter","De Gruyter eBook Chapters"

Seaports are the most critical point in the maritime logistics chain because of its multimodal and complex nature. Consequently, coordinated communication among any seaport stakeholders is vital to improving their operations. Currently, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Port Community Systems (PCS), as primary enablers of digital seaports, have demonstrated their limitations to interchange information on time, accurately, efficiently, and securely, causing high operation costs, low resource management, and low performance. For these reasons, this contribution presents the Seaport Data Space (SDS) based on the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture model to enable a secure data sharing space and promote an intelligent transport multimodal terminal. Each seaport stakeholders implements the IDS connector to take part in the SDS and share their data. On top of SDS, a Big Data architecture is integrated to manage the massive data shared in the SDS and extract useful information to improve the decision-making. The architecture has been evaluated by enabling a port authority and a container terminal to share its data with a shipping company. As a result, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed by using the Big Data architecture functionalities. The KPIs have been shown in a dashboard to allow easy interpretability of results for planning vessel operations. The SDS environment may improve the communication between stakeholders by reducing the transaction costs, enhancing the quality of information, and exhibiting effectiveness.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963283","European Commission(grant numbers:769355); Secretaría de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946609","Analytics;big data;industry 4.0;industrial data spaces;Internet of Things;maritime;seaport;intelligent transport","Seaports;Big Data;Industries;Stakeholders;Logistics;Data models;Data mining","","37","","50","CCBY","31 Dec 2019","2020","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Focusing on the problems of slow model training speed and low forecasting accuracy due to the redundancy of training data samples and insufficient long periodic capture of data in complex weather, this paper proposes a two-stage method for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting based on data-driven. In the meteorological analysis stage, the generation power samples similar to the forecast day were extracted by inputting daily meteorological features and using maximal information coefficient (MIC) weighted grey correlation degree to form the corresponding forecast data set. In the power forecasting stage, the temporal convolutional used network (TCN) extracts local features to maintain the sequence of extracted features. Then the bidirectional gating unit (BiGRU) combined with the Skip connection strategy was used to fully learn the long and the short time sequence of photovoltaic sequences, and the attention mechanism was used to pay adaptive attention to the more important historical states. This study experimented on the measured data from a photovoltaic power station in Southeastern China. The experimental results show that this method is effective in photovoltaic power short-term forecasts. In addition, compared with the latest model, this method has smaller forecasting errors and higher robustness in the time scales of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and 60 minutes.

The mass availability of these technologies has resulted in an exponential increase in the quantity of generated data. Together with the simultaneous exponential growth in computing power, this has driven rapid advances in the application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). These developments in the fields of data availability and AI technologies present even greater challenges for law enforcement and policing, while simultaneously opening huge opportunities. Complementing the benefits of these technologies by the law enforcement authorities, criminals are also equally exploiting technology. A part of the digital world is the increasing abundance of digital evidence; from CCTV footage to emails to phone records, evidence has now gone digital and there is a requirement to ensure it is accessible, readable, and has long‐term integrity when current technology, systems, or formats have been replaced or decommissioned. There is a further requirement for a seamless interface between policing and the criminal justice system to ensure digital evidence can be presented easily and without delay. As the quantity of data being used in criminal investigations becomes increasing larger, there is a critical need to maintain records tracing the origin and processing of evidence collected in digital format to authenticate the validity of the evidence. Addressing this need, the multimedia analysis and correlation engine for organized crime prevention and investigation (MAGNETO) project proposed the use of blockchain technologies for tracking and recording the processing of information within the big‐data architecture of the criminal investigation platform. The novelty of the proposed framework relies on the use of semantic technologies for knowledge formalization and the use of immutable technology based on hashing solutions to prevent evidentiary modifications. The platform addresses the need for mitigating the impact of cognitive bias to ensure the investigation platform offers objectivity in processing evidence.","","9781119834151","10.1002/9781119834175.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9930735.pdf&bkn=9928039&pdfType=chapter","","Magnetic recording;Europe;Magnetic resonance imaging;Law;Soft sensors;Semantics;Blockchains","","","","","","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Achieving this integration involves employing various extraction, transformation, and loading processes. These processes play a crucial role in converting raw data collected from building sites into instances that align with the specified unified format. This work delves into extraction, transformation, and loading methods utilized across nine pilot building sites situated in different countries, each marked by substantial data diversity. The heterogeneity among data sources and, consequently, datasets, is effectively addressed by a customized gathering process. This process incorporates static data to enhance the overall quality, enabling better-informed decision-making. The result is a harmonized building data repository with 10 use cases and more than 8000 data points, facilitating the application of intelligent services for energy-efficient management strategies. Enrichment of data is also achieved by synchronization approaches to ensure the coherence of the data.","","978-953-290-135-1","10.23919/SpliTech61897.2024.10612635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10612635","Data lake;Extraction;Transformation and Loading (ETL);interoperability;data syncing;timeseries;static data","Databases;Soft sensors;Buildings;Loading;Decision making;Transforms;Synchronization","","1","","13","","5 Aug 2024","25-28 June 2024","25-28 June 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Law enforcement agencies require scalable analytics to extract actionable insights from large, complex datasets. We implemented a Data Lakehouse architecture to process around 8,500 crime data files i n C SV format from multiple regions, with Python-based metadata cataloging for structured access to crime outcomes, stop-and-search records, and street-level incidents. Dataflows and Notebooks in Fabric addressed regional inconsistencies and enabled efficient data transformation. Power BI reports provided intuitive and interactive visualizations for exploring geographic and temporal crime trends. Performance testing demonstrated up to 40% faster query response times compared to traditional warehouses, and regional crime analysis that previously took days was completed within hours. The results indicated that the platform scaled efficiently while maintaining stable performance under growing data volumes. Our approach demonstrates how unified analytics and visualization environments can democratize access to crime data insights, supporting evidence-based policing and public safety decision-making.","2770-5226","979-8-3315-9544-9","10.1109/ACIT65614.2025.11185634","Erasmus; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11185634","Data Platform;Microsoft Fabric;data.police.uk;Crime Analytics;Data Lakehouse Architecture","Law enforcement;Soft sensors;Decision making;Data visualization;Computer architecture;Metadata;Fabrics;Real-time systems;Time factors;Testing","","3","","14","IEEE","9 Oct 2025","17-19 Sept. 2025","17-19 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, underground water resources used in the region are incrementing exponentially. However, temporal and spatial underground water information concerning availability and quality is scarce, disabling proper decision making. In order to close that breach, we propose and embedded edge-processing Internet of Things (IoT)-based water quality monitoring system. This letter introduces the design and implementation of this solution, specifically targeted to monitor irrigation and drinking water extracted from water wells. The system is designed to be deployed in central Chile, considering the topographic conditions, which severely affect power availability and communication resources. The captured data are stored in a data lake, for further processing according to water quality models.","1943-0671","","10.1109/LES.2022.3184925","CORFO Water Technology Consortium CoTH20(grant numbers:20CTECGH-145896); Centro de Recursos Hídricos para la Agricultura y la Minería(grant numbers:Conicyt/Fondap/15130015); Conicyt Advanced Human Capital Program of the Government of Chile; CI4 Center for Industry 4.0; CYTED AgIoT Project(grant numbers:520rt0011); Proyecto Asociativo UDP “Plataformas Digitales como modelo organizacional.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9802658","Edge processing;Internet of Things (IoT);underground water;wireless","Sensors;Water quality;Monitoring;Image edge detection;Event detection;Water resources;Big Data applications;Embedded systems;Edge computing;Internet of Things;Climate change;Global warming","","18","","11","IEEE","21 Jun 2022","June 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Prognosis Smart System AI-based Applied to Equipment Health Monitoring in 4.0 Industry Scenario","A. Silva; G. F. M. Souza",University of São Paulo; University of São Paulo,2021 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS),"22 Nov 2021","2021","","","1","6","In the age of IIoT - Industrial Internet of Things, data lake, data mining, big data, and cloud computing, the smart manufacturing enables to make more informed decisions in real-time by using the database extracted from sensors in its equipment. During an operational campaign, the Health Monitoring System (HMS) also allows an understanding of how component degradation is affecting the performance of the equipment. Through a structure supported by AI, as data lake and cloud computing, the HMS provides to monitored equipment a fault detection system, early warning alarms to prevent failures and a calculation of the remaining useful life (RUL).The purpose of this paper is to present a prognosis smart system based on AI applied to HMS to support decision-making regarding operational performance of equipment. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) procedure is developed to continuously analyze the mass of monitoring data generated during the machine operation. The ability to learn the behavior patterns of the collected signals and in this way to be able to make parameter predictions with high accuracy makes artificial neural networks a powerful tool to carry out an effective prognosis. Machine operational parameters are monitored simultaneously by the prognosis smart system. Then, this information is processed by the neural network and used to characterize the machine operational condition. Upon detecting a failure trend for one or more parameters monitored by recognizing deterioration patterns, the prognosis system calculates the remaining useful life (RUL) and allows maintainers to take early actions before the failure occurrence.The proposed methodology is applied as part of a HMS of a hydro generator based on parameters registered in operator inspections routes designed to identify critical equipment degradation. The registered data representing one operational year are used to train the neural network regarding normal and abnormal machine condition. After training, the neural network is able to predict failure trends for monitored temperature parameters of the hydro-generator lubricating system that is critical to support equipment performance. Comparing prediction data and data collected by the sensors, the developed neural network reached about 0,98 RMSE score. The remaining useful life prognosis proved to be an important tool to avoid hydro generator components unexpected failures which may affect power output and cause penalties to the power generation company.","2577-0993","978-1-7281-8017-5","10.1109/RAMS48097.2021.9605722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9605722","artificial intelligence;health monitoring;smart prognosis;remaining useful life","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Degradation;Recurrent neural networks;Neural networks;Tools;Market research","","2","","15","IEEE","22 Nov 2021","24-27 May 2021","24-27 May 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
