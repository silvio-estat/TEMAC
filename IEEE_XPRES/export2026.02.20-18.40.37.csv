On the other hand, the automatic generation of raster data by remote sensing devices and environmental modeling processes was always leading to very large datasets. Currently, huge data generation rates are reached by improved sensor observation systems and data processing infrastructures. As an example, the Sentinel Data Access System of the Copernicus Program of the European Space Agency (ESA) was publishing 38.71 TB of data per day during 2020. This paper shows how the assumption of a new spatial data model that includes multi-resolution parametric spatial data types, enables achieving an efficient implementation of a large scale distributed spatial analysis system for integrated vector-raster data lakes. In particular, the proposed implementation outperforms the state-of-the-art Spark-based spatial analysis systems by more than one order of magnitude during vector-raster spatial join evaluation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3157405","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through Storage and Processing of Massive Geospatial Data for Smart and Sustainable Urban Transport (MaGIST) under National Project(grant numbers:PID2019-105221RB-C42); Galician Government(grant numbers:ED431B 2021/16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9729731","Large-scale data analysis;spatial analytics;spatial data management;vector-raster data analysis","Spatial databases;Data models;Distributed databases;Big Data applications;Data analysis;Cluster computing;Arrays","","8","","28","CCBY","8 Mar 2022","2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
