The first four are dominant maneuver, precision engagement, focused logistics, and full-dimensional protection. The fifth is information superiority-which will enable the first four concepts. This paper outlines these concepts and explains how the power of the network, through network-centric computing, is used to achieve information superiority. The paper conceptualizes information superiority as being achieved through three ad hoc grids: sensors, information, and shooters. These grids will coalesce as needed from existing resources: sensor platforms, computational nodes, weapons platforms, and communications links. These resources are intentionally designed to be pulled together to serve the Joint commander's needs, for an entire campaign or a single battle. Commanders will use the power of their vast information resources to engage and overwhelm the enemy through the exercise of all five operational concepts. The paper concludes with examples from Army tests and experiments showing how the power of information is changing the way battles are fought-and won.","","0-7803-6323-X","10.1109/EURCOM.2000.874819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=874819","","Military computing;Computer networks;Grid computing;Computer vision;Protection;Command and control systems;Weapons;Sensor phenomena and characterization;XML;Computer architecture","","6","1","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","19-19 May 2000","19-19 May 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such cases, each network node needs to explicitly estimate the performance, trustworthiness and allegiance of all other contributing nodes as a part of the general multi-sensor/multi-target state estimation process. A sensor's or information system's reporting bias-which may include intentional or unintentional human biases-is distinguished from its measurement bias.

"Resource Management for Netcentric Environments","S. Das","Charles River Analytics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA",2006 9th International Conference on Information Fusion,"12 Feb 2007","2006","","","1","3","The military resource management problem involves timely distribution and placement of materiel, personnel, and sensor assets to accommodate mission requirements throughout the world. The resource management problem of today's US military is perhaps the largest and most complex optimization problem in terms of the number of variables representing various resource types and constraints relating the variables. This modern resource management problem needs to be considered within a network centric warfare (NCW) environment, and hence the term ""sense and respond logistics"" (S&RL). In this article, the author views the resource management issue as intimately related to the problem of planning and scheduling of tasks, that is, one cannot effectively reason with resources in isolation. In the data fusion domain, this view translates to consideration of the collection management process during situation/threat assessment and courses-of-action generation processes. Within a NCW environment a node must proactively determine mission requirements based on the current situation and threat, and then coordinate with other nodes to meet those requirements via some communication mechanism (e.g. publish and subscribe) on the underlying infrastructure. The specific algorithmic approach the author advocates for dynamically managing resources is essentially based on constraint programming (CP) techniques, where constraints are declaratively stated and placed on the types and quantities of resources at hand. The constraints can also be dynamically added or retracted from the system, thus are suitable to meet the demands of a dynamic resource management environment. The approach distinguishes between consumable and non-consumable resources, and in some situations views time as a special kind of resource. The author illustrates the CP approach to resource management in NCW environments in terms of two examples. The first example is related to surveillance asset management and the second is related to logistics","","1-4244-0953-5","10.1109/ICIF.2006.301793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086079","Resource Management;Sense & Respond Logistics;Network Centric Warfare;Planning & Scheduling;Constraint Programming","Resource management;Dynamic programming;Logistics;Rivers;Personnel;Constraint optimization;Communication effectiveness;Fusion power generation;Surveillance;Asset management","","","","6","","12 Feb 2007","10-13 July 2006","10-13 July 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Propagation of signals from spatially separated radars through differing atmospheric environments, however, can introduce significant errors in target positioning and ranging. For example, simulations illustrate that two radars separated by 100 km viewing the same single target through different tropospheres could place the single target in positions separated by over 200 m. Attempts at fusing the data and resolving the information into a single object could result in operational deficiencies due to classification and discrimination errors. Additionally, anomalous propagation conditions such as tropospheric ducting can lead to radar coverage holes and hence the perception of faulty radars and system level fusion errors. These errors must be characterized and, as far as possible, eliminated if the operational effectiveness of cooperative radar engagements and capabilities are to be optimized. This paper illustrates the type and magnitude of these errors, and their likely impact on system level fusion. The architecture of a potential correction system is outlined.","","0-7803-9286-8","10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1591867","Data fusion;radar errors;refraction;diffraction;ducting","Terrestrial atmosphere;Surveillance;Diffraction;Frequency;Atmospheric modeling;Radar clutter;Absorption;Radar scattering;Ionosphere;Radar detection","","10","","15","IEEE","13 Feb 2006","25-28 July 2005","25-28 July 2005","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To facilitate situation assessment, we investigate the problem of jointly classifying and identifying multiple targets in radar sensor networks where the maximum number of categories and the maximum number of targets in each category are obtained a priori based on statistical data. However, the actual number of targets in each category and the actual number of target categories being present at any given time are assumed unknown. It is assumed that a given target belongs to one category and one identification number. The target signals are modeled as zero-mean complex Gaussian processes. We propose a joint multi-target identification and classification (JMIC) algorithm for radar surveillance using cognitive radars.

However, the study of these distributed problems at the complete-architecture level, accounting for (among yet other factors) organizational information-sharing protocols, dynamic network topologies, mixes of stationary and moving sensors, complex object dynamics, equipment failure modes, node-specific tracking algorithms and data fusion algorithms, does not seem to have been addressed in any ""holistic"" way. This paper addresses these issues and describes an integrated testbed being developed at the University at Buffalo's Center for Multisource Information Fusion for the empirical study of these complex architectures involving, in essence, the interconnection of multiple systems.","1062-922X","0-7803-7952-7","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244711","","Target tracking;Modems;Sensor fusion;Network topology;Algorithm design and analysis;Industrial engineering;Sensor systems;Wireless communication;Military communication;Protocols","","3","","23","IEEE","17 Nov 2003","8-8 Oct. 2003","8-8 Oct. 2003","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, tactical edge networks present an extremely challenging and heterogeneous networking environment due to heterogeneous architectures, dynamic topologies, unwanted adversarial behavior, interference, and other wireless channel conditions. In order to support end-user applications and guarantee system performance and interoperability in such constrained environments, it is critical to adapt the volume and type of traffic generated by applications to the continuously varying network conditions. To this end, we extended the Agile Computing Middleware (ACM) with capabilities specifically designed to provide network state detection and adaptation in constrained networks. In this paper, we present SENSEI (for Smart Estimation of Network StatE Information), a set of components of the ACM that provides effective strategies for the dissemination of network state information. SENSEI implements a content- and context-aware clustering-based algorithm for the distribution of network state information that can significantly reduce the overhead associated with network state information sharing.","2155-7586","978-1-5386-0595-0","10.1109/MILCOM.2017.8170825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8170825","Computer network management;network state estimation;adaptive middleware;tactical networks;mobile ad hoc networks","Peer-to-peer computing;Monitoring;Protocols;Synthetic aperture sonar;Intelligent sensors;Middleware","","5","","11","IEEE","11 Dec 2017","23-25 Oct. 2017","23-25 Oct. 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Application of Bayesian reasoning for Military identification and classification","A. Bodenmüller","EADS Deutschland GmbH, CASSIDIAN, Ulm, Germany",2013 13th International Conference on Intellient Systems Design and Applications,"13 Oct 2014","2013","","","13","19","During the last decade a notable change of the requirements concerning situational awareness and network centric warfare operations of Naval and Ground Based Air Defense Systems can be recognized. Induced by the ongoing transformation process of the military forces and the changing security policy a set of additional sensors and information sensors is required to contribute to the tactical picture compilation. In the field of military target identification and classification many publications are known describing a data fusion process for typical military sensors and sources. Classical sensor equipment like IFF and ESM and sources like Flight Plans, Airspace Control Procedures, Identification by Origin and Link16 are well known and standardized how to be integrated into a Bayesian fusion process. These standardized sources will continue to be important information sources of the information fusion process. However further sensor types and information sources will contribute in the future to the information fusion process and will complete the Situational Awareness, especially in the context of asymmetric situations and semi-military missions. This paper gives an overview of our solution for the extension of the Bayesian identification process in order to establish a tactical picture for air, surface (naval) and land targets.","2164-7151","978-1-4799-3516-1","10.1109/ISDA.2013.6920747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920747","military target identification and classification;Situation Awareness;Bayes decision theory;AIS;NFFI","Support vector machine classification;Missiles;Military aircraft;Marine vehicles","","1","","9","IEEE","13 Oct 2014","8-10 Dec. 2013","8-10 Dec. 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
