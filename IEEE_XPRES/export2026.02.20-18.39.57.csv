"Enhanced Shared Situational Awareness and Decision Support in Maritime Firefighting: Insights from the Overheat Project","H. Ahmad; P. Merino-Laso","French Maritime Academy (ENSM), Nantes, France; French Maritime Academy (ENSM), Nantes, France",2025 IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA),"15 Jul 2025","2025","","","17","24","Maritime fires on container ships are an important issue in global shipping operations involving numerous actors. In these scenarios, Shared Situational Awareness (SSA) plays a critical role. This paper examines the challenges of these incidents, emphasizing the prevalence of human error and the limitations of traditional fire detection and coordination methods. It applies Endsley's three-level model of Situational Awareness (SA) and proposes a model for SSA development specific to such emergencies. The Overheat Project is introduced, highlighting the development of a Digital Solution (DS) to address enhanced SSA through real-time data integration and a collaborative platform. This platform connects vessels and on-shore data systems, providing a common operational picture (COP) for all stakeholders involved in fire response. The architecture of the DS is described, outlining the onboard and ground-based components that facilitate seamless data exchange. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of this solution in improving fire safety and response capabilities on container ships.","2379-1675","979-8-3315-3308-3","10.1109/CogSIMA64436.2025.11079492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11079492","shared situational awareness;fire management;container ships;digital solution","Data integration;Collaboration;Computer architecture;Containers;Real-time systems;Data systems;Stakeholders;Marine vehicles;Fire safety","","1","","36","IEEE","15 Jul 2025","2-5 June 2025","2-5 June 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
