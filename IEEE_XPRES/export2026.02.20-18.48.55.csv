"Using Big Data Analytics to Create a Predictive Model for Joint Strike Fighter","R. Norman; J. Bolin; E. T. Powell; S. Amin; J. Nacker","Big Data and Knowledge Management, Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), Alexandria, VA; Big Data and Knowledge Management, Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), Alexandria, VA; Big Data and Knowledge Management, Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), Alexandria, VA; Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JPO), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Arlington, VA; Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JPO), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Arlington, VA",2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),"24 Jan 2019","2018","","","3590","3596","The amount of information needed to acquire knowledge on today's acquisition systems is growing exponentially due to more complex, higher resolution, software-intensive acquisition systems that need to operate in System-of-Systems (SoS), Family-of-Systems (FoS), Joint, and Coalition environments. Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (T&E) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the T&E community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.The true product of T&E is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the T&E community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during T&E. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace. The net result of these commercial best practices is a solid foundation for the DoD to transform how it uses data to achieve faster, better, and smarter decisions throughout the acquisition lifecycle.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622388","Big Data;Data Analytics;Knowledge Management;Data Management;Virtualization;Cloud Computing;Predictive Maintainance;Department of Defense;Test and Evaluation","Big Data;Knowledge management;Tools;US Department of Defense;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Data analysis","","5","","0","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","10-13 Dec. 2018","10-13 Dec. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the huge business and research value behind the large-scale data, big data technology has become one of the hotest research fields in academia and industry. To the big data, storing and processing the data is core function of the file systems. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the most typical distributed big data architecture, which has the characteristics of high reliability, high fault tolerance, and low hardware cost. HDFS provides the efficient task implementation and fault tolerance among nodes by Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism. However, the traditional RPC mechanism has remarkable defects with the fixed timing method, and cannot quickly establish the relationship between node downtime and network congestion. In this paper, we propose an improved adaptive RPC mechanism for node fault tolerance and performance. The proposed method classifies nodes by the data block access statistic, and dynamically adjusts the RPC interval time. This method can be used to reduce the networking traffic and processing pressure of NameNode nodes, and improve the I/O and task performance. Through the node classification, an inrack method is used to achieve better performance on fault tolerance. Eventually, we design the extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method, and experimental results show it improves the performance compared with state-of-the-art method.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00270","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172058); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074913","Hadoop Distributed File System;Remote Procedure Call;Task Performance;Fault Tolerance","Industries;Fault tolerance;Adaptive systems;Heart beat;File systems;System performance;Fault tolerant systems","","2","","15","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","18-20 Dec. 2022","18-20 Dec. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Challenged by large-scale private data collected from user side, GNN may not be able to reflect the excellent performance, without rich features and complete adjacent relationships. Addressing the problem, vertical federated learning (VFL) is proposed to implement local data protection through training a global model collaboratively. Consequently, for graph-structured data, it is a natural idea to construct a GNN-based VFL (GVFL) framework. However, GNN has been proven vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Whether the vulnerability will be brought into the GVFL has not been studied. This is the first study of adversarial attacks on GVFL. A novel adversarial attack method is proposed, named Graph-Fraudster. It generates adversarial perturbations based on the noise-added global node embeddings via the privacy leakage and the gradient of pairwise node. Specifically, first, Graph-Fraudster steals the global node embeddings and sets up a shadow model of the server for the attack generator. Second, noise is added into node embeddings to confuse the shadow model. Finally, the gradient of pairwise node is used to generate attacks with the guidance of noise-added node embeddings. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Fraudster achieves the state-of-the-art attack performance compared with baselines in different GNN based GVFLs. Furthermore, Graph-Fraudster can remain a threat to GVFL even if two possible defense mechanisms are applied. In addition, some suggestions are put forward for the future work to improve the robustness of GVFL.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. HGrid is a Hadoop data engineering tool made by solusi247 for Map Reduce, Spark and Storm frameworks which has been built since 2011 to help programmers building server-side data processing applications by automatically generate codes based on visually designed workflow. The biggest challenge to build this tool was to make most of the functions, modules, libraries and even workflow schemes (nearly) compatible between frameworks and to make a multipurpose single Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Big Data availlable in the desktop and on the cloud. The development of the HGrid library starts with the collection of functions needed, how they can be implemented in each framework and how the codes can be generated. HGrid generated codes were also benchmarked against some commercially availlable tools to ensure good performance. HGrid is also designed to be visual, robust and user friendly although it still need to be improved in user experience part. It is also designed for average programmers and analysts. Data engineering libraries has been continuosly developed to ease application development with target near zero programming at the programmers side. HGrid has been used largely at the telco operators in Indonesia, in the largest banks, government institutions, hospitals and military to build complex applications such as Data Lake, Mediation Device, Media Analytics and many others.","","978-1-7281-8741-9","10.1109/CcS49175.2020.9231309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9231309","","Visualization;Codes;Storms;Programming;Media;Data engineering;Libraries","","","","0","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","23-26 Sept. 2020","23-26 Sept. 2020","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
