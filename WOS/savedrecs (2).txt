   combining the                designed data fusion algorithm with
   different                sensor data. The crop distribution and the
   terrain                characteristic are combined, and the travelling  
   speed and the harvesting depth are adjusted through                the
   self adaptive control strategy, to reduce the                repeated
   travelling and missing harvesting area.                The machine
   learning algorithm is utilized to                evaluate the health
   condition of the crop, and the                decision support system is
   integrated to provide                real-time harvesting and management
                  suggestion.

   helps farmers to                scientifically manage farms, and
   improves                management efficiency and decision quality.     
   Automatic and intelligent design of the system,                reduces
   the dependence on the manual operation,                makes the
   agricultural production more modern and                automatic, and
   reduces the labor intensity of the                farmers. The damage of
   the crops and the damage of                the soil structure are
   reduced, and the quality of                the crops is protected. The
   reaping path is                optimized, the empty driving and repeated
   covering                area of the machine in the field is reduced, so

AB The dramatic increase in flight volume and density has inevitably led to
   the small-scale clustering of aircraft, presenting significant
   challenges for air traffic controllers due to the complex
   interrelationships involved. In order to better characterize the
   clustering phenomenon and its complexity with massive real-time data,
   this paper introduces a data-driven fusion framework. This framework
   incorporates an interdependent network and a novel indicator system
   based on potential field theory to characterize the interaction and
   superposition effects within these clusters, encompassing aircraft,
   airspace waypoints, and air traffic controllers. To further explore the
   complexity of clusters according to the characteristic indicator system,
   a deep learning model is employed to identify these cluster scenarios.
   Training results on these scenarios indicate that the deep learning
   model, using the GRU-attention model, excels in capturing the complex
   features of clusters. In practical scenario experiments, the proposed
   fusion framework integrates the interdependent network, characteristic
   indicator system, and the GRU-attention model. It has proven effective
   in characterizing clusters and evaluating their complexities. This not
   only provides real-time alerts but also supports decision-making for air
   traffic controllers in challenging situations.

TI Using Mobile Health Technology and Real-Time Assessments to Address
   Multilevel Influences on Lumbar Spine Surgery Outcomes
DT Awarded Grant

AB PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTLumbar spine surgery for degenerative disease is
   one of the most common and most expensive surgeriesperformed in the
   United States. However, there is substantial variation in lumbar surgery
   rates, approaches,and patient-reported outcomes at the surgeon,
   hospital, and regional levels. One major cause of theseinconsistencies
   is the lack of evidence-based tools to both predict outcome and
   personalize treatmentrecommendations. For example, while there has been
   growing recognition that pain symptoms reflect acomplex interplay of
   biochemical, psychological, and social factors that influence surgical
   outcomes, thesefactors are not typically incorporated into surgical
   treatment plans. One important factor preventing theexpansion of
   evidence-based treatments, particularly related to behavioral and
   cognitive interventions, is a lackof precision tools to measure dynamic
   symptom profiles for pain and related psychosocial comorbidities.
   Inparticular, traditional patient assessments use cross-sectional (i.e.,
   one-time) questionnaires that are subject torecall bias and fail to
   capture longitudinal symptom dynamics. Mobile health (mHealth)
   technology has enableda fundamentally new approach to collect intensive
   longitudinal patient-reported and biometric data to
   supportindividualized decision-making. In particular, ecological
   momentary assessment (EMA) is an emerging tool thatleverages brief
   mobile surveys to obtain momentary, longitudinal assessments of core
   disease constructs.Complementing EMA, mobile fitness trackers, such as
   Fitbit, passively collect biometric data (e.g., activity,heart-rate, and
   sleep) that reflect the physiologic manifestations of lumbar
   spine-related disability and impairedpsychosocial health. These
   innovative tools may provide a newfound ability to capture
   importantbiopsychosocial features that impact surgical outcome.
   Recognizing these evidence gaps and the value ofemerging mHealth
   technology, this study’s overall objective is to establish the utility
   of using real-timepatient-reported and biometric data to prognosticate
   and stratify lumbar spine patients, and to establish thevalue
   proposition for implementing these methods. This objective will be
   accomplished through the followingAims. In Aim 1 I will investigate the
   ability of mHealth assessments to identify novel disease features
   withprognostic importance for degenerative lumbar spine surgery
   patients. In Aim 2, I will use real-time mHealthassessments to identify
   novel phenotypes of lumbar disease. In Aim 3, I will define the value
   proposition andimplementation context for using mHealth assessments to
   address functional and psychosocial influences onlumbar surgery
   outcomes. These research activities will be combined with a rigorous
   mentored trainingprogram incorporating chronic pain research, machine
   learning, behavioral intervention development, andimplementation
   science. At the completion of this award, I will be prepared to submit
   an R01 applicationintegrating data analytics, implementation science,
   and the biopsychosocial model of pain to test interventionsto improve
   lumbar spine surgery outcomes.

   therapy in Lilongwe, Malawi.

AB Background: Mobile health (mHealth) is reshaping healthcare delivery,
   especially in HIV management. The World Health Organization advocates
   for mHealth to provide healthcare workers (HCWs) with real-time data,
   enhancing patient care. However, in Malawi's Lighthouse Trust
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic, the nurse-led community-based ART
   (NCAP) program faces hurdles with data management due to lack of access
   to electronic medical records systems (EMRS) in the community setting.
   EMRS is not typically available in differentiated service delivery
   settings where reliable power and internet are often unavailable. We
   used human-centered design (HCD) processes to create a mobile EMRS
   prototype, the Community-based ART Retention and Suppression (CARES)
   app. We explore progress to simplify workflow for HCWs and improve
   client care.
   Methods: To evaluate the CARES app's feasibility and acceptability among
   NCAP HCWs, we conducted in-depth interviews among 15 NCAP HCWs. We used
   a rapid qualitative analysis approach guided by the extended Technology
   Acceptance Model. The study complied with the Consolidated Criteria for
   Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ).
   Results: As a likely result of HCD, HCWs demonstrated high expectations
   for the CARES app to improve healthcare delivery and data management.
   However, challenges such as app performance, data integration, and
   system navigation were significant barriers to acceptance or
   feasibility. Despite challenges, HCWs remained optimistic about the
   potential for CARES to enhance NCAP clinical decision-making and data
   flow. HCWs emphasized the need for continuous training and stakeholder
   engagement, improved infrastructure, data security protections, and
   establishing the CARES app and EMRS integration to facilitate CARES'
   longterm success at scale.
   Conclusion: The study's findings underscore the importance of HCD for
   mHealth buy-in. As HCWs were invested in CARES success, they remained
   optimistic that the app could enhance NCAP services if user experience
   and app performance improved. Incorporation of HCW feedback would help
   deliver beyond the promise of CARES.

   NOVELTY - The system has a data processing and analysis               
   module that is responsible for data cleaning, data               
   integration and data analysis, identifying patterns                of
   energy waste and carbon emissions, finding the                main
   sources of energy consumption, and providing                guidance for
   optimal decision-making. An energy                model building module
   builds a model of energy                consumption and carbon emissions
   based on the                results of the data processing and analysis
   module.                The model is able to depict the
   interrelationships                between energy sources. An
   optimization algorithm                application module utilizes an
   energy model and                uses a linear programming algorithm to
   formulate an                energy usage strategy. A parameter
   adjustment and                control module automatically or
   semi-automatically                adjusts the parameters and operating
   modes of an                energy system under the guidance of an
   optimization                algorithm.
   USE - Low-carbon energy optimization system based on               
   carbon emission dual-control used in energy                management.
   ADVANTAGE - The optimization algorithm application module               
   is based on the established model and uses linear               
   programming algorithms to provide intelligent                decisions
   for optimal energy use strategies to                achieve dual
   reductions in energy efficiency and                carbon emissions. The
   parameter adjustment and                control module automatically
   adjusts the parameters                and operating modes of the energy
   system to achieve                real-time energy optimization under the
   guidance of                the algorithm.

AB Water is an important driver for many environmental processes and can be
   key in the timing, scale and impact of natural hazards. Floods,
   landslides, storms and droughts are becoming more frequent and intense
   under climate and land use change. These water-related hazards pose
   direct impacts (e.g., damage to buildings, crops and infrastructure, and
   loss of life and property), and indirect impacts (e.g., losses in
   productivity and livelihoods, increased investment risk, indebtedness
   and human health impacts) to society, both acutely and at longer
   timescales.   Traditional methods for assessing, monitoring, analysing,
   forecasting and disseminating water-related hazards are poorly connected
   or standalone and, this combined with the complex interactions between
   rain, river flow, groundwater and tides, make it difficult to predict
   and understand flooding. Recent advancements in digital technology,
   communications, numerical modelling and Earth Observations (E.G. remote
   sensed satellite data) allow many of the limitations of traditional
   methods to be overcome through the integrated, holistic approach of a
   Digital Twin (DT).   A digital twin is dynamic virtual copy of a
   physical asset, process, system or environment that looks like?and
   behaves in real time identically to its real-world partner. For
   flooding, a digital twin approach is timely, as we can now leverage
   Earth Observation and large telemetered datasets to inform numerical
   models of catchment properties in real-time, allowing scenario analysis,
   forecasting and interpolation to be undertaken with less delay. This
   also allows the rapid 'gaming' of management scenarios/solutions where
   practitioners or users of the DT can try out different management
   methods or scenarios to see if this helps flooding before the events
   themselves.  Through a programme of Earth Observation, sensor and
   network integration, modelling, data infrastructure development and
   stakeholder engagement, our project will build a digital twin for
   water-related hazard forecasting and decision-making for Hull and the
   East Riding of Yorkshire, a region heavily impacted by complex
   hydrometeorological hazards. The novelty of our approach is the
   co-production of the DT in collaboration with multi sectoral end users,
   as well as our engagement with one of the more complex environmental
   ecosystems (hydrology and flooding) in terms of data integration and the
   physical processes involved.  This is a 15 month &pound;700k project for
   the NERC TWINE (developing pilots for environmental digital twin) call.
   It involves interdisciplinary collaboration between natural and social
   science researchers from The University of Hull (Modelling, SUDs),
   Imperial College, London (Remote sensing and surface hydrology), British
   Geological Survey (Groundwater modelling and digital twin integration)
   and the University of Western England (investigating stakeholder end
   user interactions with DT's).

AB Weather routing is a navigation technique that uses real-time
   meteorological and forecast data to chart the safest and most efficient
   course for maritime vessels, minimizing the risks posed by adverse
   weather and sea conditions. It involves the integration of spatial
   analysis techniques to optimize the route. Spatial analysis operations,
   like processing and visualizing geospatial data, can be carried out
   within a Geographic Information System (GIS). In this study, a GIS
   framework for weather routing is developed, utilizing datasets for the
   Tyrrhenian Sea provided by the Weather and Sea-State Monitoring and
   Observing System at Parthenope University of Naples, including wave
   direction and height. Methodologically, the study involves the creation
   of thematic maps using raster calculators to classify and visualize the
   aforementioned meteorological and marine variables. Within this context,
   a navigational framework is developed in QGIS, integrating raster data
   as well as vector data to provide navigators with advanced
   decision-making support. Preliminary findings suggest promising
   enhancements in navigation capabilities, indicating significant
   potential for improving route efficiency and safety through the
   application of advanced GIS-based weather routing techniques.

AB Due to global weather anomalies and climate change, natural disasters
   are increasingly escalatinginto extreme catastrophes year by year. The
   intense summer rains, late autumn heatwaves, and earlysnowfall in
   central Korea in November 2024 reflect the extreme climate phenomena and
   the evolvingparadigm of disasters. By utilizing advanced Earth
   observation platforms and remote sensing technologies,it is possible to
   effectively predict and prepare for disasters, collect timely
   observational data to respondin real-time during disaster management and
   conduct integrated analyses of large-scale disaster damagealongside
   existing spatial information. The special issue of the National Disaster
   Management ResearchInstitute (NDMI) in 2024 introduced case studies of
   landslide damage assessment using remote sensingand spatial information
   integration, and safety inspections of facilities using multi-sensor
   drones.Furthermore, it focused on recent trends in research related to
   the fusion of remote sensing and spatialinformation technologies, as
   well as the research outcomes of the NDMI. The integrated analysis
   approachbased on remote sensing and spatial information is meaningful
   for systematic disaster accidentmanagement during the prevention,
   preparedness, response, and recovery phases. Specifically, the fusionof
   remote sensing and spatial information analysis and its application are
   expected to play a crucial rolein pre-disaster prediction, rapid

AB Precision agriculture struggles with scalability, data integration, and
   decision-making, prompting innovative solutions. Recent advancements
   like CNNs and cloud computing provide interesting answers but confront
   challenges. Data quality, processing needs, interoperability, and
   real-time decision-making are issues. These difficulties demand
   innovative data synchronization, model dependability, and system
   scalability methods. This project uses sophisticated analytics and cloud
   technology to improve nutrient management systems. Improving
   scalability, accuracy, and efficiency while presenting unique data
   fusion and userfriendly interfaces are goals. Clear problems and goals
   guide the study's scope and purpose. Wireless soil nutrient sensors can
   capture real-time data on important soil factors such as pH levels, the
   amount of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium present, and more. This
   information is then sent to a platform hosted in the cloud, where it is
   processed using sophisticated data analytics and machine learning
   algorithms, in addition to previous crop performance data and agronomic
   models. The program will create tailored suggestions for nutrient
   management, including topics such as the kinds of fertilizer,
   application rates, and the best time. These proposals give farmers more
   agency, allowing them to make educated decisions via an easily navigable
   interface. Because of the system's ability to react to changing
   circumstances and its continual monitoring, nutrient management
   techniques are kept in sync with those changes throughout the crop's
   life cycle.

AB This paper delves into the challenges encountered in decision-making
   processes within Hybrid Energy Systems (HES), placing a particular
   emphasis on the critical aspect of data integration. Decision-making
   processes in HES are inherently complex due to the diverse range of
   tasks involved in their management. We argue that to overcome these
   challenges, it is imperative to possess a comprehensive understanding of
   the HES architecture and how different processes and interaction layers
   synergistically operate to achieve the desired outcomes. These
   decision-making processes encompass a wealth of information and insights
   pertaining to the operation and performance of HES. Furthermore, these
   processes encompass systems for planning and management that facilitate
   decisions by providing a centralized platform for data collection,
   storage, and analysis. The success of HES largely hinges upon its
   capacity to receive and integrate various types of information. This
   includes real-time data on energy demand and supply, weather data,
   performance data derived from different system components, and
   historical data, all of which contribute to informed decision-making.
   The ability to accurately integrate and fuse this diverse range of data
   sources empowers HES to make intelligent decisions and accurate
   predictions. Consequently, this data integration capability allows HES
   to provide a multitude of services to customers. These services include
   valuable recommendations on demand response strategies, energy usage
   optimization, energy storage utilization, and much more. By leveraging
   the integrated data effectively, HES can deliver customized and tailored
   services to meet the specific needs and preferences of its customers.

AB Due to the numerous production links of nuclear power plants, complex
   organization and process, and the distribution of multiple nuclear power
   plants in different regions, the safety and efficient operation of the
   nuclear power Group as a whole has brought great challenges. To
   establish an industrial Internet at the level of the nuclear power
   group, provide means to eliminate data islands, integrate massive data
   resources and improve data use efficiency, improve the safety management
   level and operation performance of nuclear power plants, and reduce
   costs, this paper designed a cloud edge collaborative architecture of
   nuclear power industrial Internet DHP, which meets the coordination and
   interaction and safety requirements of nuclear power plant side and
   center side. It creates the foundation for low latency, high
   concurrency, and reliable production command in the safety production
   management system and overhaul command center. According to the data
   characteristics of the nuclear power industry, a timing data acquisition
   and configuration tool and a running soft gateway are adapted to meet
   the timing data access requirements of typical business scenarios of the
   nuclear industry and have the ability to access high-frequency vibration
   and low-frequency timing data at the same time. Independently designed
   and implemented a complete technical framework for the acquisition,
   transmission, storage, and processing of high-dimensional time series
   data in the nuclear industry, which can support real-time access and
   calculation of millions of measurement points. Based on metadata
   management, an access channel for multi-source heterogeneous data is
   established to coordinate data extraction, data processing, data
   storage, data scheduling, quality audit, data service and other links.
   The end-to-end, closed-loop data governance and control mechanism is
   studied, and the nuclear power data is governed and assets are opened
   with this method. The whole life cycle management of nuclear power data
   is realized, which meets the data resource demand in the field of
   equipment reliability management, and improves the management ability
   and query efficiency of complex data. Taking the China Nuclear Power
   Data Center and six nuclear power bases as representatives, the platform
   construction and engineering practice have formed a data sharing and
   collaboration channel between the data center and the edge side. The
   research results show that DHP gathers and processes China's nuclear
   power production and management data, and realizes effective data
   integration and processing so that multiple production, operation,
   maintenance, and other applications can be based on consistent data for
   timely perception, fast processing, and efficient decision-making.
   Therefore, the nuclear power industry Internet cloud edge collaboration
   framework established in this paper can provide support for digital and
   intelligent nuclear power, has a wide application prospect, and can
   provide technical references for the construction of nuclear power data
   ecology.

AB Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is an advanced framework for financial
   planning in China's dynamic economic landscape. Unlike traditional
   models-Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), Capital Asset Pricing Model
   (CAPM), and Value at Risk (VaR)-which have limited adaptability, CBR
   leverages historical data to provide a more responsive financial
   decision-making approach. This study evaluates CBR using statistical
   analyses, showing that it significantly outperforms MPT, CAPM, and VaR
   in adaptability, real-time data integration, risk management, and
   strategy formulation. The results indicate that CBR is the most robust
   model among those tested, making it well-suited for dynamic financial

AB Objective The objective of this study was to assess the predictability
   of admissions to a MH inpatient ward using ML models, based on routine
   data collected during triage in EDs. This research sought to identify
   the most effective ML model for this purpose while considering the
   practical implications of model interpretability for clinical
   use.Methods The study utilised existing data from January 2016 to
   December 2021. After data pre-processing, an exploratory analysis
   revealed the non-linear nature of the dataset. Six different ML models
   were tested: Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, k-Nearest Neighbours
   (kNN), Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) using InterpretML, and Support
   Vector Machine using Support Vector Classification (SVC). The
   performance of these models was evaluated using various metrics
   including the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).Results Among the
   models evaluated, the CatBoost model achieved the highest MCC score of
   0.1952, demonstrating superior balanced accuracy and predictive power,
   particularly in correctly identifying positive cases. The InterpretML
   model also performed well, with an MCC score of 0.1914. While CatBoost
   showed strong predictive capabilities, its complexity poses challenges
   for clinical interpretation. Conversely, the InterpretML model, though
   slightly less powerful, offers better transparency and is more practical
   for clinical use.Conclusion The findings suggest that the CatBoost model
   is a compelling choice for scenarios prioritising the detection of
   positive cases. However, the InterpretML model's ease of interpretation
   makes it more suitable for clinical application. Integrating explanation
   methods like SHAP with non-linear models could enhance model
   transparency and foster clinician trust. Further research is recommended
   to refine non-linear models within decision support systems, explore
   multi-source data integration, understand clinician attitudes towards
   ML, and develop real-time data collection systems. This study highlights
   the potential of ML in predicting MH admissions from ED data while
   stressing the importance of interpretability, ethical considerations,
   and ongoing validation for successful clinical implementation.

AB The management of unmanned technology is becoming increasingly important
   in various fields, including the aviation industry, geodesy, the
   agricultural sector, and many others. To ensure efficient and safe
   management, most robots require the use of various remote-control
   systems, which can be complex and overly costly. However, the Cascade
   DataHub method offers a new approach to organizing the management of
   unmanned technology, based on integrating real-time data from various
   sources into a single platform. This method provides fast and convenient
   access to important data for decision-making, improves the accuracy and
   efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicle management, and reduces remote
   control costs. In this article, we will delve deeper into the Cascade
   DataHub method and its application for organizing work management, as
   well as analyse its advantages and disadvantages.
   The Cascade DataHub method allows for creating a unified platform for
   collecting, processing, and analysing data from unmanned aerial
   vehicles. This method enables the integration of various data sources,
   such as GPS, cameras, sensors, other control, and monitoring systems,
   into a unified system that allows monitoring, analysis, and real-time
   management of the devices.
   The key feature of the method is the ability to create various
   connections between data, allowing the analysis and control of robots
   from different perspectives. Thanks to real-time data processing
   technology, operators can instantly respond to dangerous situations,
   enhancing the safety and reliability of management.
   Furthermore, the Cascade DataHub method helps reduce drone management
   costs by enabling control and monitoring of agents remotely from a
   convenient location, reducing the need for a large amount of specialized
   equipment and personnel.
   Despite the advantages of the Cascade DataHub method, it also has its
   drawbacks. One of the biggest drawbacks is the need for high-speed
   internet connection to transmit a large amount of data in real-time.
   There may also be issues with system stability in unforeseen situations,
   such as the disconnection of one of the data sources.

AB The increasing frequency of natural disasters and climate change events
   presents significant challenges for emergency response operations. Area
   monitoring for civil protection purposes is critical to safeguard
   resources, track and survey assets, and optimize decisionmaking.
   Coordination of resources is crucial in crisis situations where timely
   and accurate information is essential. Aviation traffic plays a key role
   in civil protection missions such as firefighting or search and rescue
   operations. Monitoring aviation and satellite data is of major
   importance and is one of the primary goals of this research. Real-time
   monitoring and alerting can be extremely useful to local authorities,
   NGOs, and the general public. In this paper, we introduce an online
   visualization tool that uses data aggregation/fusion to provide command
   capabilities and informative visualizations along with great
   functionality for real-time command and control operations. This system
   could be particularly beneficial for multiple stakeholders, including
   municipalities and the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection.

AB Command and Control Systems are complex integrated information systems
   composed of multiple subsystems. Each subsystem has its own data storage
   methods and data formats, which makes data communication between
   subsystems extremely difficult. This results in data resource waste.
   Early methods of obtaining required data from the databases of the
   subsystems by programming and then analyzing them were time-consuming
   and labor-intensive. Therefore, in practical applications, it is
   necessary to integrate the data of these subsystems and provide an
   effective method to query these data, to help combat personnel perform
   analysis and decision-making. Existing data integration methods face two
   challenges: (1) when the source database is updated, the integrated data
   cannot be updated in real-time; (2) due to the inconsistent data storage
   types of each subsystem, a mapping and transformation mechanism needs to
   be manually established between subsystems data. To address these
   challenges, we propose a Spark-based virtual data warehouse design
   scheme. It accesses Spark via JDBC and operates Hive through Spark to
   build a virtual data warehouse. We use an Equipment Management System
   and Combat Mission Planning System as examples to verify the feasibility
   of this scheme. This scheme can effectively handle data from different
   subsystems, thus improving the efficiency of the Command and Control
   Systems.

AB Hydroelectric power, or hydropower, harnesses thepoleulialenergy of
   water descending from higher to lower elevations to generate
   electricity. As a well-established and cost-effective renewable energy
   technology, it not only produces power but also supports significant
   water management services. The integration of Internet of Things (loT)
   technologies in hydropower plants has shown significant potential in
   enhancing monitoring, efficiency, and control capabilities. However,
   current implementations often lack a holistic and standardized approach
   to contextual modeling. To address this gap, this paper presents a
   comprehensive approach to modeling the structural and operational
   components of hydropower plants (HPPs) using NGSLID data models. We
   propose detailed NGSLID data models that incorporate both static
   properties (e.g., location, structural attributes), relationships (e.g.,
   component interactions, hierarchical dependencies) and dynamic
   properties (e.g., real-time sensor data, operational status). These
   models are designed to facilitate efficient data integration, support
   decision-making processes, and enable the development of interoperable
   and replicable Icif applications for smart hydropower plants. We
   validate our approach through deployment and testing on a federated
   context broker architecture using real-world data from HPPs.

AB This paper examined how data mining may analyse food security data and
   anticipate community activity constraints. Studies have shown that IRCA
   measures interrupt agricultural operations, diminish crop yields, risk
   food shortages, raise food costs, increase food poverty, and deplete
   nutrients. Data mining can handle huge, complicated information, find
   hidden patterns and relationships, and anticipate food security
   outcomes. These enable evidence-based decision-making and proactive
   actions. However, challenges related to data quality, biases, and
   reliance on historical data must be addressed. Future directions include
   integrating real-time data sources, such as satellite imagery and social
   media data, to capture timely information. Additionally, advanced
   analytics techniques like deep learning and natural language processing
   can be utilized to analyze unstructured data. Overcoming challenges
   related to data integration, privacy concerns, interpretability, and
   transparency will enhance the effectiveness of data mining. In summary,
   this analysis highlighted the significance of data mining in analyzing
   food security and predicting the impact of IRCA measures. By leveraging
   data mining's strengths and addressing its limitations, valuable
   insights can inform decision-making and promote resilient food systems.
   Advancements in real-time data integration and advanced analytics
   techniques hold promise for further enhancing the effectiveness of data
   mining in addressing food security challenges.

   heterogeneous data in a factory in real time. The               
   production management data changes are monitored.                The
   production pressure of each product type is                calculated
   according to the production task                schedule, the production
   task data and the                production line data of the production
   line. The                utilization rate of each production line
   personnel                is calculated according to the workshop
   personnel                data. Determination is made that whether the   
   earliest production schedule completion date in the               
   second production line is earlier than the earliest               
   production schedule completion date in the first               
   production line and the earlier time exceeds a                preset
   time threshold. The production task schedule                of the first
   production line is added to enable the                first production
   line. The newly added production                task is added to the

AB Salmonella is a leading cause of foodborne illness, resulting in 1.35
   million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations, 420 deaths, and costs the
   US economy $4.1 billion annually. Despite nationwide efforts, the
   infection rates have been unchanged for three decades,
   disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, making it a ���One
   Health��� issue. To cope with this challenge, this project establishes
   diverse partnerships with the poultry industry, end-to-end supply
   chains, food banks, and Extension educators. The objective is to create
   a transformative sensor-enabled decision support system (DSS; termed as
   SENS-D), which incorporates multiple rapid sensing technologies and
   sensing systems prototypes, along with visualization, prediction, and
   optimization capabilities to detect and mitigate Salmonella
   contamination throughout the poultry supply chain. SENS-D is envisioned
   to provide data-driven solutions that significantly improve food safety,
   equity, efficiency, and resilience, particularly among disadvantaged
   populations. The sensing systems are portable, easy-to-use, accurate,
   and cost-effective. By integrating sensor results with the DSS, this
   technology will ensure an equitable and secure food supply, facilitated
   through collaborations with food safety stakeholders. SENS-D can be
   adapted to detect various pathogens in other food products including
   beef, pork, dairy, and produce, ultimately reducing the $152 billion
   economic burden of foodborne illness in the U.S. To promote inclusivity
   and maximizing social impact, the project will engage underrepresented
   and vulnerable groups, stakeholders, students and postdoctoral
   researchers. Additionally, this initiative will train the workforce to
   tackle equitable food safety by creating new educational and training
   opportunities for convergence science approaches at the intersection of
   Public Health, Poultry Science, Food and Animal Science, Supply Chain,
   Engineering, and Analytics/AI.<br/><br/>This project develops three
   innovative sensing technologies and user-centric prototypes for portable
   systems, transforming poultry testing by enabling rapid, multiplex, and
   quantitative detection and surveillance of Salmonella serovars within
   10-60 minutes. The Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy sensor integrates
   metal nanoantennas on a side-polished multimode optical fiber core,
   enabling rapid, quantitative detection of Salmonella serovars. The
   impedance-based biosensor concentrates Salmonella to a detectable
   threshold, capturing and identifying the pathogen, while the
   nanopore-facilitated, multi-locus checkpoint sequencing sensor
   differentiates Salmonella serovars through single-nucleotide variations.
   The DSS employs advanced analytics and AI to monitor, predict, and
   mitigate Salmonella risks, both spatially and temporally, in a
   sensor-enabled poultry supply chain. It utilizes a cloud based One
   Health data environment for real-time data integration from the sensing
   system. Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will
   predict Salmonella levels and product shelf-life. Optimization will be
   used for sensor placement, intelligent distribution of food, and
   workforce planning to facilitate implementation of sensors, while
   achieving multiple performance metrics of safety, equity, efficiency,
   and resilience. An analytical toolkit will determine the efficacy of
   policies and interventions for Salmonella mitigation. Through
   stakeholder and end-user engagement, SENS-D has the potential to
   transform Salmonella mitigation and significantly enhance food
   safety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
   been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
   intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

DT Awarded Grant
PD Nov 15 2023
PY 2023
AB The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
   development of an artificial intelligence (AI) powered platform for
   continuous, real-time, personalized prediction, monitoring, and
   management of unwanted behavior in patients with autism and
   developmental disabilities. The proposed technology is designed for
   families of individuals with autism to receive real-time insights and
   personalized strategy suggestions, improving their quality of life.
   Early intervention enabled by this platform also may lead to benefits
   for insurance companies and hospitals due to savings related to
   pharmaceuticals and repeated emergency department visits. In addition,
   practitioners and schools may benefit from automated data analysis,
   enhancing evidence-based decision-making and student support.
   Psychiatric hospitals may improve treatment approaches, reducing
   hospitalizations and emergencies. The proposed AI-driven platform may be
   used for behavior analysis, positively impacting individuals with autism
   and their families.  The proposed technology may lead to an advancement
   in personalized behavior management strategies for autism and
   developmental disabilities.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on
   the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the
   prediction and management of unwanted behavior in autism patients. The
   proposed platform leverages advanced AI and machine learning algorithms
   to extract patterns from visual, auditory, and kinesthetic data, and
   uses these data to facilitate early risk assessment and supportive
   evidence-based management plans. The collected data, including
   non-wearable sensor information and caregiver input, undergoes advanced
   analysis for personalized prevention strategies and optimal risk
   management. By integrating multi-stream sensor data fusion, AI-driven
   pattern mining, and real-time analysis, the project bridges the gap
   between existing behavioral intervention methods and cutting-edge
   technology. The contribution lies in the fusion of diverse data sources
   to extract meaningful patterns, providing caregivers, practitioners,
   schools, and hospitals with actionable insights for behavior
   management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
   been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

TI Multimodal Disaster Impact Assessment Models for Enhanced Resilience
DT Awarded Grant
PD Nov 01 2023
PY 2023
AB Immediately after a major hazard event (e.g., wildfire, earthquake,
   flood), a prompt assessment of the geographic distribution and severity
   of infrastructure damage is vital to the success of the emergency
   response and early recovery planning. This situational awareness is an
   important part of the decision-making processes that are implemented by
   facility owners, users, emergency responders and local and state
   officials. Conversely, a general lack of knowledge about the impacted
   state of the built environment can lead to a disorganized public
   response and slower recovery. While a comprehensive assessment of the
   extent and distribution of infrastructure damage can be obtained from
   in-person inspections conducted by building professionals, depending on
   the scale of the event, this can be a lengthy, resource intensive
   process. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will
   address this challenge by utilizing principles from artificial
   intelligence (AI) to develop near real-time infrastructure damage
   prediction models that can process and utilize different types of data
   and information (e.g., images, text, tabular data). By advancing our
   ability to effectively integrate disparate information sources, this
   project aims to transform the way that physical damage to infrastructure
   is estimated in the aftermath of a major disaster event, thereby
   enhancing the emergency response and recovery planning phases that
   follow. The research will provide training for doctoral and masters
   students and an opportunity to teach undergraduates from different
   backgrounds how science and engineering coupled with AI technologies can
   be used to improve community response to extreme
   events.<br/><br/>Fundamental concepts and methodological advancements in
   multimodal learning will be used to transform and enhance infrastructure
   damage prediction models for use in the immediate post-event
   environment. The state-of-the-art in image-based damage assessment will
   be advanced along two dimensions: (1) developing Vision
   Transformer-based methods and (2) establishing a self-supervised
   learning methodology for training the models using large collections of
   unlabeled data. A new knowledge base will be established around the
   broad area of multimodal data fusion for infrastructure damage
   prediction models. Specific questions regarding unified representation,
   translation across and alignment between modalities and data fusion will
   be answered. A new type of hazard-agnostic infrastructure damage
   prediction model will also emerge from this research. Such a model will
   have the ability to receive an integrated representation of one or more
   types of input modalities (i.e., image, text, and engineering/tabular
   data) and produce, as output, an infrastructure damage level that is
   agnostic to the type of causal event (e.g., earthquake or hurricane).
   Using a comprehensive data set from multiple natural hazard events
   (hurricane and earthquake), the project will include experiments to shed
   new light on the ability of both hazard-specific and hazard-agnostic
   multimodal models to enhance early-stage infrastructure damage
   assessments for increased situational awareness and enhanced
   resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
   been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
   intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI CAREER: Transforming Distribution System Situational Awareness via
   Continuous-Time Adaptive Data Fusion
DT Awarded Grant
PD Oct 01 2023
PY 2023
AB This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan
   Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>In the path to the clean energy
   future of the nation, the electric power industry is witnessing a
   massive shift from centralized fossil fuel generation to distributed
   renewable energy generation. Power distribution systems are responsible
   for connecting customers to the main grid and balancing the
   instantaneous generation-load mismatch at each customer. As power flows
   in the distribution systems become highly volatile and bidirectional, it
   is of crucial importance to gain situational awareness in real time such
   that grid operators can assess and enhance the renewable energy hosting
   capacity, and customers can reliably, resiliently, and efficiently
   buy/sell electricity to meet their needs. As a variety of data sources
   are being populated in distribution systems, the fundamental question
   remains how to extract and integrate the information to construct a
   complete picture of distribution system operation. Existing methods have
   not fully considered the complicated measurement environment pertaining
   to power distribution systems, and cannot produce accurate and reliable
   results when the measurements have diverse sampling rates, sampling
   times, accuracy classes, and with limited communication support. This
   project will develop transformative concepts and methodologies to
   comprehensively address the outstanding challenges in tracking the
   operating states of distribution systems. The outcomes of the project
   will fully bring out the potential of various sensor assets for
   distribution system situational awareness, which will serve as the
   foundation of intelligent decision making processes for accommodating
   the volatile but pervasive distributed renewable energy generation
   across the grid. The project will feature a Seeable Electrical Energy
   Distribution (SEED) program to integrate research with education. It
   will develop a simulation and visualization platform for a close-to-real
   synthetic distribution system ���operating��� in real time 24/7,
   providing educational experience to the wide public that has not been
   possible without entering control rooms of a utility company. The
   platform will also serve as a public data portal for researchers around
   the nation, facilitating data availability and research reproducibility
   across the whole technical community.<br/><br/>State estimation is a key
   technology for enabling the situational awareness of distribution
   systems and massive integration of distributed renewable energy
   generation. The existing distribution system state estimation methods
   largely inherit mature concepts from state estimation of high-voltage
   transmission systems, and do not fully consider or address the unique
   complicated measurement environment in distribution systems, including
   the unknown continuous-time state transition model, asynchronous and
   multi-rate measurements, unknown and time-varying measurement error
   statistics, and limited sampling rates and communication bandwidth. This
   project will propose a revolutionary distribution system state
   estimation paradigm that will transform the situational awareness of
   distribution systems for accommodating massive and pervasive renewable
   energy integration and demand response. We will develop new concepts and
   methodologies that result in a holistic solution allowing 1)
   learning-based continuous-time system dynamics modeling, 2) seamless
   fusion of asynchronous and multi-rate measurements arriving at any
   continuous time instants, 3) adaptive near-optimal estimation under
   unknown and time-varying measurement error statistics, and 4) proactive
   scheduling of sensor sampling times to maximize observability and
   minimize communication congestion using clustering. With the
   continuous-time data fusion feature, the proposed paradigm will replace
   the conventional discrete-time step-by-step estimation paradigm and
   reshape the field of distribution system state estimation. In a unique
   Seeable Electrical Energy Distribution (SEED) program, generative
   adversarial network will be exploited to synthesize distributed
   renewable energy and load data, which cannot be distinguished from
   real-world data yet do not have proprietary issues and can be freely
   distributed and reused by the research community.<br/><br/>This award
   reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
   through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
   impacts review criteria.

   tool to identify under-performing assets
DT Awarded Grant
PD Sep 30 2023
PY 2023
AB **FOAK 23 | Atmo Smart Depot & Asset Savings | Creating a digital twin
   tool to identify under-performing assets**  **The Problem:** Rail depot
   managers face a significant challenge -- they lack access to real-time
   data necessary for making informed decisions to optimise depot
   operations fully. Data is scattered across various platforms, making it
   difficult to gather valuable insights. Additionally, much of this "dark
   data" remains unused, hiding answers to questions that could optimise
   depot operations and improve maintenance of essential assets including
   rolling stock.  **Our Solution:** We envision creating a smart depot by
   integrating existing datasets with data collected from newly deployed
   IoT sensors collecting energy usage, GPS, machinery vibration, air
   quality, noise and more. This integration will generate a digital twin
   of the depot, providing decision-makers with an overview of everything
   happening on site. This data will be distilled into Key Performance
   Indicators (KPIs) and metrics that provide valuable insights to improve
   operations effectively.  **Innovation at Its Core:** AtmoCore Smart
   Depot stands out due to its seamless integration of multiple
   technologies into one easy-to-use platform. Our data- and
   hardware-agnostic approach ensures compatibility with existing
   infrastructure, able to use any IoT protocol.  A key innovation lies in
   our practice of data fusion, where we combine multiple datasets to
   identify new trends, patterns and links between disparate datasets,
   finding insights that are only possible when you look at the whole
   picture. This analysis allows us to develop algorithms that produce
   meaningful KPIs, enabling depot managers to assess the depot's
   performance at a glance.  **Benefits to Rail Freight Industry:**  1.
   Cost Savings: By optimising depot operations and asset utilisation,
   AtmoCore will lead to significant cost savings for Network Rail, SWR,
   and other operators. 2. Environmental Sustainability: The platform's
   ability to monitor energy, fuel, and water usage, along with air and
   noise pollution, will help reduce emissions and give depot managers
   control over environmental impact. 3. Improved Decision-making: With
   real-time KPIs and insights, depot managers can make informed decisions
   to enhance operational efficiency and safety. 4. Operator-Agnostic
   Solution: AtmoCore is designed to be deployable across multiple
   Train-Operating-Companies (TOCs) and Freight-Operating-Companies (FOCs),
   ensuring wide industry applicability.  **Why Atmo:** With a proven track
   record, Atmo is uniquely positioned to bring innovations from other
   industries into the rail sector. Our team of data scientists and
   software engineers are experts in extracting value from untapped data
   sources, delivering maximum value to our clients.

TI QuSeC-TAQS: Distributed Entanglement Quantum Sensing of Atmospheric and
   Aerosol Chemistries
DT Awarded Grant
PD Sep 01 2023
PY 2023
AB This project addresses a pressing challenge for society - how to track
   and to respond to a rapidly changing climate. The goal is to develop and
   demonstrate a quantum sensing platform that features an in situ
   distributed sensor network to measure and understand atmospheric
   chemistries and climate variables. At its most fundamental level, an
   entangled quantum network is capable of sensing multiple geographically
   and locally distinct systems with higher precision than the summation of
   each system probed individually. Entangled networks can thus elucidate
   non-classical correlations between probes over distributed nodes.
   Extending the physical limits of sensing to measure and analyze complex
   datasets from the environment at the thermodynamic and quantum noise
   limits can aid with societal well-being and public health. The
   convergent expertise of the team assembled brings together quantum
   science & engineering, electrical & computer engineering, atmospheric &
   geosciences, chemistry & biochemistry, and applied mathematics. This
   effort is aligned with the launch of the US CHIPS and Science Act, and
   for US competitiveness in quantum technologies. Atmospheric and
   geoscientists will leverage new quantum measurement technologies from
   this project to address key measurement challenges: varied measured
   environments, better time resolution in spectroscopy, higher sensitivity
   through distributed entanglement, and/or the ability to measure
   transient species. A major societal impact will be in public health
   decision-making, based on newly enabled measurements and real-time
   analyses of atmospheric chemistries with unprecedented spatial-temporal
   resolution, providing actionable information on locality, e.g., to
   prevent respiratory illness, enabled in real-time by a comprehensive
   entangled network of quantum sensors. With UCLA on track to become an
   Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) by 2025, this effort develops a
   highly qualified, diverse workforce, building on a track-record of
   non-traditional education programs, including the Cal-Bridge and Physics
   Bridge, creating opportunities for historically underrepresented groups
   at Cal State campuses. UCLA Women in Engineering WE@UCLA Technical
   Academies will introduce quantum sensing with programming around this
   program���s technologies resulting, in collaboration with industry,
   startups, and non-academic stakeholders in atmospheric chemistry and
   geosciences.<br/><br/>Quantum sensing is a powerful paradigm that
   encompasses the use of non-classical states of light and matter to probe
   species of interest. Compared to classical probes, non-classical states
   of light in metrology, including frequency-multiplexed high-dimensional
   entangled photons and squeezed light across distributed networks,
   exhibit uncharted sensing capabilities. This project comprises two
   interdisciplinary and synergistic Thrusts: 1. quantum-enabled networked
   sensor systems, involving sensor data fusion and multimodal learning on
   quantum sensors, and distributed entanglement-assisted high-dimensional
   precision phase metrology in remote sensing at and beyond the standard
   quantum limit (SQL). This effort is complemented with thrust 2. on
   quantum sensor arrays for molecular fingerprinting, involving
   hyperspectral dual-comb spectroscopy and stabilization beyond the
   standard quantum limit, and molecular dual-comb spectroscopy at the
   Schawlow-Townes limits and a quantum-limited THz spectrometer. Relevant
   to the broader quantum sensing community, the program will demonstrate
   distributed entanglement for quantum metrology towards below-SQL
   biochemical sensitivities, including biphoton and multi-partite
   time-frequency entanglement sources, in the presence of noise and
   channel losses in each sensing pathway. The team focus will be on
   chemical species that are challenging to measure, including reduced and
   oxidized forms of N, S, and C, as well as NH3, NOx, and free radical
   chemistries. Further, the team leverages and advances the mathematics of
   real-time analyses and quantum sensor data fusion. This project was
   co-funded by the Quantum Sensors Challenge for Transformative Advances
   in Quantum Systems (QuSeC-TAQS) program, and the NSF Office of
   International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects
   NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
   evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts

DT Awarded Grant
PD Jul 15 2023
PY 2023
AB Robotic-assisted surgery cyberinfrastructure combines advanced data
   analytics and decision making in the cloud with interconnected Internet
   of Things-based systems that has brought opportunities for advanced
   diagnostics, patient monitoring, and personalized medicine. However, the
   increased data and resource sharing enabled by these devices and
   artificial intelligence in the robotic-assisted surgery infrastructure
   has increased vulnerabilities and opportunities for cyberattacks. In
   particular, data-integrity attacks that interfere with critical
   real-time data can potentially disrupt surgical performance and
   compromise patient safety. Existing studies on cyberinfrastructure
   security in these environments do not fully consider users���
   cybersecurity awareness and knowledge or evaluate training and
   mitigation for cyberattacks. This project aims to create a
   Human-Centered Cybersecurity in Robotic Surgery (HCCRS) framework by
   integrating data analytics and healthcare human factors to design new
   human-centered algorithms to detect, identify, and mitigate cyberattacks
   in the robotic surgery cyberinfrastructure. The HCCRS framework will

TI CRII: SCH: Towards Smart Patient Flow Management: Real-time Inpatient
   Length of Stay Modeling and Prediction
DT Awarded Grant
PD Jun 01 2023
PY 2023
AB Patient length of stay has been used as an essential criterion for the
   effective planning and management of hospital resources. Prolonged stay
   increases patients��� risk of hospital-acquired infections and disrupts
   patient flow and access to high-quality healthcare services. As such, a
   model that can reliably predict the length of stay for a specific
   patient is desirable to mitigate the prolonged stay and guide
   personalized decision-making. However, the length of stay can be
   affected by a multitude of factors and can vary based on different
   patients��� conditions and disease progression. The complex and dynamic
   nature of massive clinical data, not to mention the presence of a large
   portion of missing and censored values in the healthcare data, poses
   significant challenges for efficient modeling and dynamic prediction.
   This project aims to offer an integrated solution by establishing a
   pipeline consisting of advanced statistical modeling, monitoring, and
   deep learning techniques based on patient information collected from
   heterogeneous medical systems over time. The success of the project will
   catalyze a transition from a traditional standard-driven discharge
   scheduling service to a data-driven proactive scheduling paradigm. The
   success of the project will alleviate the hospital���s pressure on
   resource allocation and improve patient flow and, more importantly,
   pandemic preparedness. The project can provide opportunities for
   research-based interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate
   students in health informatics, statistics, and artificial intelligence
   from diverse backgrounds, including women and underrepresented
   minorities.<br/><br/><br/>This project will address the critical
   challenges of healthcare data analysis, i.e., heterogeneity,
   multi-modality, and data sparsity. Conventional data-driven methods have
   been predominantly focused on identifying the factors that strongly
   influence the length of stay as opposed to predicting the length of stay
   itself. Moreover, the existing approaches failed to address the inherent
   uncertainty and were incapable of incorporating different data
   modalities and dynamic prediction. The project proposes a personalized
   framework by integration of advanced tensor fusion and time-to-event
   modeling techniques towards smart patient flow management, which
   ultimately allows for faster achievement of health outcomes and
   reduction of hospitalized costs. The proposed intelligent framework will
   advance the state-of-art research of real-time data fusion and
   personalized prognosis in the following aspects: (1) brings the data
   fusion and length of stay prediction into a unified framework; (2)
   facilitates personalized length of stay prediction in a real-time
   manner; (3) naturally has the capability to incorporate uncertainties in
   the decision-making process to provide a confident and intelligent
   scheduling service. Although the methodology is proposed for the patient
   length of stay prediction, it does not depend on any restrictive
   assumptions of domain knowledge and specific disease and thus can
   potentially be applied to a broad range of events
   predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
   has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
   Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

AB Traffic congestion, abandonment and devastation of buildings and public
   spaces in Athens city center form a troubled urban landscape in the
   heart of the metropolitan capital. Daily users, residents, employees,
   visitors desire the quality upgrading of public space through
   environmental upgrading and sustainable mobility, and the promotion of
   the international metropolitan character of the city. A strategy for
   reshaping the character and function of the historic Athenian triangle
   is proposed, aiming at its environmental and sustainable development
   through feasible, meaningful and non-landscaping solutions of low cost
   and high positive impact. Sustainable mobility is the main principle of
   re-planning the study area, while the main strategy is to transform the
   historic triangle of Athens into a "Low Pollution and Limited Vehicle
   Traffic Zone". The proposed measures include the development of
   pedestrian mobility networks by expanding the pedestrian paths and slow
   traffic routes, bicycle networks based on the approved Metropolitan
   Bicycle Route of Athens while a methodology for enhancing public
   transportation networks with new lines of electric mini-buses is
   developed in the study area. Complementary actions are proposed through
   the provision of Wi-Fi on public transports, development of applications
   that facilitate combined travel and provide real-time data, integration
   of personal mobility (roller skates, scooters, hoverboard) and
   enhancement of their use as flexible modes of personal mobility combined
   with the car-sharing, ride-sharing and dynamic carpooling initiatives.

AB Monitoring the perimeter of a wildfire in real time is crucial for
   effective firefighting and decision-making. This paper proposes a
   multi-UAV system that combines real-time infield data with a fire
   propagation model to accurately predict the state of the wildfire
   perimeter and improve fire prediction. To achieve this, a data fusion
   scheme is used to merge historical data with real-time measurements
   obtained from UAVs to update the fire propagation model. The model is
   then used to predict the future perimeter of the fire, which then guides
   the team of UAVs to track the perimeter more accurately. The system has
   been tested through simulation experiments, indicating its effectiveness
   in providing accurate real-time wildfire perimeter propagation
   information.

AB Effective fire detection is critical in firefighting operations,
   especially in remote and challenging-to-access areas. This study
   introduces and tests a fire detection model in two National Parks. Each
   location utilises drones, cameras, and sensors monitoring environmental
   parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure, CO, CO2). The model employs
   an algorithm analysing sensor data to assess current fire risk in
   real-time, aiding timely decision-making for drone deployment. A
   star-of-stars wireless sensor network (WSN) layout maximises coverage
   with minimal resources, adaptable to various terrains. The scalable,
   distributed system leverages virtualisation technologies, enhancing
   cost-effectiveness in monitoring inaccessible terrain. Future
   integration of AI-driven solutions promises advanced data analysis,
   bolstering local fire prevention strategies.

AB In the wake of the wide promotion of 5G network, the era of
   super-high-speed networks and the Internet of Everything is approaching.
   Combining digital technologies led by 5G with landscape architecture has
   become an important way for the sustainable development of garden
   ecology. In order to achieve refined management of gardens and improve
   the accuracy and consistency of garden environmental data monitoring,
   this study constructs a new IoT sensor multi data fusion algorithm
   model. Considering the high redundancy and large error data collected by
   multiple sensors, this paper proposes a multi data fusion algorithm
   based on adaptive trust estimation and improved D-S evidence theory. The
   experimental data demonstrates that matched with IGA-BP, algorithm in
   this paper obtained the largest fitness value and the fastest
   convergence speed in three sensor application scenarios with different
   numbers of nodes. The lowest values were obtained in terms of unit
   energy consumption and network latency indicators. In the monitoring
   experiment for environmental data of landscape architecture, the
   algorithm obtained lower relative error and mean square error than
   IGA-BP in four environmental parameters of temperature, humidity, light
   intensity and carbon dioxide concentration. Therefore, the algorithm is
   effective in real-time monitoring of landscape garden environmental
   data, and can provide decision-making data for garden management as a
   reference.

TI Opioid and SUD Data Enclave (O-SUDDEn): Bringing real-time data to the
   opioid crisis
DT Awarded Grant
PD Sep 30 2022
PY 2022
AB ABSTRACTThe widespread availability of synthetic opioids (fentanyl) has
   fueled the rapidly rising rates of unintentional overdose (OD)
   fatalities. Policy makers, state and local agencies, and investigators
   have focused on the Ohioexperience as a bellwether for the experiences
   of other states because of the representativeness of Ohio’sdemographics.
   The lack of timely geospatially-linked longitudinal data sources has
   impeded the ability ofcommunities and state agencies to pivot allocation
   of resources to regions where they are needed most. Limitedintegration
   of environmental risk factors such as sociodemographic characteristics
   fail to support identification ofnew targets for intervention or new
   approaches to emerging threats from changes in local drug supply.
   Webelieve that agile data systems and informatics tools that can be used
   to demonstrate the utility of predictiveanalytics and machine
   intelligence approaches on how to enable data-driven decision making
   will ultimatelyprove translatable across the country and diverse
   localities. Our proposed Opioid and Substance Use DisorderData Enclave
   (O-SUDDEn) will provide a novel and transformative approach to support
   rigorous andreproducible research on the opioid and substance use
   crises. O-SUDDEn will fill several existing gaps in datainfrastructure
   and prediction models that include machine learning, geospatial
   analyses, and community context.The specific aims for O-SUDDEn are as
   follows: Aim 1: Data linkage with establishment of O-SUDDEn. Wewill
   develop a geospatially-sensitive, individual-level secure data lake that
   integrates multiple disparate datasources that meets the requirement of
   a coded-limited set under HIPAA. New data sources include
   real-timeindividual-level longitudinal data from urine drug testing
   (UDT) and community contextual data based on theOhio Opportunity Index,
   an area-level social determinants of health developed and used by our
   team. We willdevelop query and use tools for data harmonization and
   integration, prepare and release data sets fordissemination and
   secondary data analyses; and facilitate secondary use of related
   administrative data togenerate evidence that informs targeted opioid
   interventions. Aim 2: Develop Predictive Models andSurveillance
   algorithms. Geospatial and machine learning will be used to model the
   contribution of opioid,cocaine, and stimulant use on OD, OD death and
   opioid use disorder/substance use disorder (OUD/SUD);temporal
   relationship of real time data including UDT and demographic and
   contextual variables to identify high-risk populations and
   subpopulations or geographic locales. We will validate model

   analysis carried out for the Ada Tepe site is a set                of
   192000 hazard curves. The family of hazard                curves and
   associated weights contain information                about the seismic
   hazard at site and its                uncertainties. Similar confidence
   response spectra                are calculated together with the PGA
   evaluation.                The spectral characteristics of ground motion
   are                determined by the relative impact of the seismic     
   source characteristics and the attenuation               
   characteristics of the propagation path of the                seismic

   USE - System for designing geographical information               
   system for seismic hazard and risk analysis along                with
   precautionary measures.
   ADVANTAGE - The system integrates basic geo datasets in               
   thematic mapping products and to assess the seismic               
   hazard using GIS techniques to provide a basis for               
   disaster management of the case study of Ada Tepe                in
   Bulgaria. GIS is applied as a valuable tool to                support an
   effective decision making by managing,                structuring and
   utilizing comprehensive data for                disaster prevention. Web
   GIS is of interest to us                in the future work, because it
   is provided the ease                for real-time access and
   simultaneous informed                decision-making process for all
   stakeholders                involved. The GIS data integration key
   challenge                ensures the interoperability of data. The      
   ontology-based approach for disaster management in               
   presented local area facilitates interoperability                both on
   data and organization of emergency                services. The foster
   data availability and data                applicability for all phases
   of disaster management                such as mitigation, prevention,
   preparedness,                response and recovery are provided for
   enhancing                interoperability it would be very beneficial to
   use                INSPIRE data specifications as a basis for the       
   local datasets. The data dictionary was constructed                in
   order to create an efficient repository of                information
   that supports different stakeholders                for disaster
   management. Global seismic risk and                vulnerability are
   increasing steadily as                urbanization and development
   occupy more areas that                are prone to effects of strong
   earthquakes.

AB The current project addresses the needs of the US population that
   suffers from low back pain (LBP). Chronic recurrent LBP is a significant
   public health problem that results in functional limitations and
   disability, as well as financial burden for the individual and society.
   Up to 80% of people will experience LBP at some point in their lifetime,
   and the total costs of LBP in the U.S. exceed 100 billion dollars per
   year, including lost wages resulting from an inability to work. Physical
   therapy is effective for managing chronic LBP and improving patient
   outcomes. However, patient adherence to physical therapist (PT)
   recommendations is low, and research suggests that real-time
   personalized feedback on posture and movement throughout the day can
   improve outcomes. However, there are major limitations of existing
   sensor systems. Additionally, there is a need to integrate these sensor
   data with existing sensor technologies and clinical measures. To address
   this need, this project will design and develop a sensor system that
   supports remote monitoring of posture and movement in patients with LBP,
   patient adherence to PT recommendations, and the impact of adherence on
   outcomes. This system will both advance the science through development
   of non-invasive, low-profile sensors to measure low back posture and
   movement in a real-life setting, and connect this novel sensor
   information with existing devices and clinical measures that are used to
   monitor activity and the impact of pain in patients with LBP. Further,
   new diagnostic and treatment information gathered from these novel
   sensors could be used to advance treatments and improve outcomes for
   people with LBP. This research could also be extended to management of
   other serious health conditions, such as amputations, spinal cord
   injury, and stroke. This work will result in innovations in wearable
   technologies, deep learning, system integration, and human-computer
   interfaces. Notably, we will validate the fabric sensors for distributed
   motion monitoring using Electrical Impedance Tomography and develop
   algorithms to capture not how much strain the wearer is experiencing but
   also the direction of these strains. For predictive modeling, we will
   use mathematics and a statistical approach that maps the received data
   to the category of strain being experienced. In addition to advancing
   the science and clinical practice, this project will contribute to the
   training of a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers at the
   intersection of engineering and health sciences across PhD, Masters, and
   undergraduate students, and health professional trainees.<br/><br/>The
   MS-ADAPT system is proposed as a human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system
   that integrates data from novel fabric sensors with data from wrist
   accelerometers and app-based patient-reported outcomes, and uses
   machine-learning analytics to enable predictions in support of
   personalized physical therapy. The work is structured into five research
   aims: 1) fabric sensors for functional movement assessment of the lumbar
   spine: distributed sensing is achieved by forming a network of smart
   ���K-Tape sensors���, which are strain-sensitive nanocomposites
   integrated with commercial kinesiology tape for characterizing skin
   strains, movements, and muscle activity, 2) data integration and
   visualization: a platform for integrating multi-model data (changes in
   skin resistance and strain maps from smart K-Tape sensors; accelerometry
   from Fitbit; and patient-reported outcomes from apps) and PT
   visualizations to support decision-making; 3) laboratory assessment to
   interpret smart K-Tape data for objective assessment of lumbar spine
   movement and muscle activity, 4) novel machine-learning models that
   reflect lumbar spine biomechanics: create both physics-based models and
   deep learning models to predict posture and movement type, muscle
   activation, movement magnitude, and quality, and 5) clinical evaluation:
   assess posture and movement in a free-living environment, adherence to
   PT recommendations, and the association with improvement in terms of LBP
   symptoms and function. Many technical challenges exist with respect to
   characterizing new sensors and using novel data streams for precision
   medicine insights. Both physics-based models and CNN-LSTM models will be
   created and compared for predicting the movement type and quality and
   assessing adherence to PT recommendations throughout the
   day.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
   deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
   intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

   aspects for safe care delivery in the operating room (OR). Non-technical
   skills ofsurgery have been identified as the most frequent causes for
   sentinel events that impact patient mortality, post-operative pain, and
   quality of life. Lapses in communication, teamwork, and leadership have
   been shown toaccount for 60% of major perioperative complications, most
   of which are related to communication failures. Giventhis strong link
   between NT and team skills and patient safety, several NT skills
   assessment tools have beenvalidated specifically for surgical teams.
   However, they require the presence of trained observers or
   retrospectivereview of videos. Such methods are time-consuming and
   resource intensive to obtain. Importantly, theseassessments are subject
   to multiple assessment biases of the observer which threatens their
   objectivity andvalue. Automated tools that do not require an expert
   observer to conduct real-time observations, do not needtime-intensive
   audio-video analysis, and could provide objective, quantifiable, and
   continuous measurements ofNT skill are, thus, highly needed and could
   allow for the more widespread implementation of NT skills training.The
   objectives of the current project are to 1) investigate and develop
   predictive models linking objective sensor-based data streams with
   individual and team non-technical skills, 2) test non-intrusive sensing
   devices insimulated surgical team simulation training for practicing

   system for measuring NT skills in surgical simulation.A collaborative
   team of human factors engineers and surgeon educators will perform
   summative usabilityevaluation and determine usability with the System
   Usability Scale and Technology Acceptance Model. For Aim2, our team will
   implement sensors in well-validated surgical simulations with
   experienced and inexperiencedteams. As sensors continuously collect
   data, observer-based non-technical skill assessment tools will
   beperformed real-time and video recorded. Analytics, data fusion, and

   distinguishdifferences in team skills between teams with/without
   TeamSTEPPS training. The expected deliverables willinclude usability
   validation of a non-intrusive sensing system and analytics framework for

   undertake four Specific Aims: In Aim 1, the research team willbuild
   data-driven instruments by jointly optimizing the optical hardware and
   the back-end machine learning modelfor a given task. Optimized iFLIM and
   iDOS instruments with increased capabilities and higher SNR will
   bedeveloped for clinical use. In Aim 2, the research team will develop
   effective and expressive visualizationinterfaces and human comprehension
   of multimodality imaging data. These tools will provide critical
   informationfor critical decision making and improve clinical workflow.
   In Aim 3, the research team will develop new AI toolsto integrate
   heterogenous multimodality data to predict patient outcome. The
   multi-model data integrationapproach will overcome the limitations of
   each single modality being considered in isolation. Finally, in Aim
   4,the research team will incorporate these new techniques into clinical

   each single modality being considered in isolation. Finally, in Aim
   4,the research team will incorporate these new techniques into clinical
   workflow to provide real-time feedback forsurgical guidance. By
   accomplishing these aims the research team will develop and validate a
   set of advancedanalytical methods with AI/ML/DL for intelligent
   instrument design, data/image analysis, visualization, and
   clinicaldecision making. Strong interactions and shared resources
   between this TRD and TRDs1 and 2 will enableperformance advancements in
   the imaging and inference capabilities. The combination of these
   approaches willpave the way for choosing highly personalized treatments
   based on predictions of individual patient outcome.

TI CAREER: Transforming Distribution System Situational Awareness via
   Continuous-Time Adaptive Data Fusion
DT Awarded Grant
PD Mar 01 2022
PY 2022
AB This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan
   Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>In the path to the clean energy
   future of the nation, the electric power industry is witnessing a
   massive shift from centralized fossil fuel generation to distributed
   renewable energy generation. Power distribution systems are responsible
   for connecting customers to the main grid and balancing the
   instantaneous generation-load mismatch at each customer. As power flows
   in the distribution systems become highly volatile and bidirectional, it
   is of crucial importance to gain situational awareness in real time such
   that grid operators can assess and enhance the renewable energy hosting
   capacity, and customers can reliably, resiliently, and efficiently
   buy/sell electricity to meet their needs. As a variety of data sources
   are being populated in distribution systems, the fundamental question
   remains how to extract and integrate the information to construct a
   complete picture of distribution system operation. Existing methods have
   not fully considered the complicated measurement environment pertaining
   to power distribution systems, and cannot produce accurate and reliable
   results when the measurements have diverse sampling rates, sampling
   times, accuracy classes, and with limited communication support. This
   project will develop transformative concepts and methodologies to
   comprehensively address the outstanding challenges in tracking the
   operating states of distribution systems. The outcomes of the project
   will fully bring out the potential of various sensor assets for
   distribution system situational awareness, which will serve as the
   foundation of intelligent decision making processes for accommodating
   the volatile but pervasive distributed renewable energy generation
   across the grid. The project will feature a Seeable Electrical Energy
   Distribution (SEED) program to integrate research with education. It
   will develop a simulation and visualization platform for a close-to-real
   synthetic distribution system ���operating��� in real time 24/7,
   providing educational experience to the wide public that has not been
   possible without entering control rooms of a utility company. The
   platform will also serve as a public data portal for researchers around
   the nation, facilitating data availability and research reproducibility
   across the whole technical community.<br/><br/>State estimation is a key
   technology for enabling the situational awareness of distribution
   systems and massive integration of distributed renewable energy
   generation. The existing distribution system state estimation methods
   largely inherit mature concepts from state estimation of high-voltage
   transmission systems, and do not fully consider or address the unique
   complicated measurement environment in distribution systems, including
   the unknown continuous-time state transition model, asynchronous and
   multi-rate measurements, unknown and time-varying measurement error
   statistics, and limited sampling rates and communication bandwidth. This
   project will propose a revolutionary distribution system state
   estimation paradigm that will transform the situational awareness of
   distribution systems for accommodating massive and pervasive renewable
   energy integration and demand response. We will develop new concepts and
   methodologies that result in a holistic solution allowing 1)
   learning-based continuous-time system dynamics modeling, 2) seamless
   fusion of asynchronous and multi-rate measurements arriving at any
   continuous time instants, 3) adaptive near-optimal estimation under
   unknown and time-varying measurement error statistics, and 4) proactive
   scheduling of sensor sampling times to maximize observability and
   minimize communication congestion using clustering. With the
   continuous-time data fusion feature, the proposed paradigm will replace
   the conventional discrete-time step-by-step estimation paradigm and
   reshape the field of distribution system state estimation. In a unique
   Seeable Electrical Energy Distribution (SEED) program, generative
   adversarial network will be exploited to synthesize distributed
   renewable energy and load data, which cannot be distinguished from
   real-world data yet do not have proprietary issues and can be freely
   distributed and reused by the research community.<br/><br/>This award
   reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
   through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
   impacts review criteria.

TI SBIR Phase I: Drone-Delivered AEDs for Treatment of Out-of-Hospital
   Cardiac Arrest
DT Awarded Grant
PD Feb 15 2022
PY 2022
AB The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
   Phase I project is to reduce emergency medical services (EMS) response
   times and improve patient outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests
   (OHCA) through the creation of a 911-integrated drone service. Sudden
   cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 450,000 deaths annually and
   is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Of these
   deaths, ~350,000 occur outside of the hospital. Survival for OHCA in the
   U.S. is around 8%-10%, and despite considerable effort this statistic
   has changed little over the past three decades. The solution to
   improving OHCA outcomes is early and effective bystander cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation (e.g., chest compressions) and prompt defibrillation using
   an automated external defibrillator (AED). In locations with
   publicly-available AEDs, survival has increased 40%-70%. However, ~70%
   of OHCAs events occur in private residence, and public-access AEDs are
   not available for these patients. Drones can deliver AEDs to the scene
   of a cardiac arrest more quickly than a ground ambulance team, enabling
   early defibrillation by bystanders with the potential for substantive
   improvements in survival rates. The impact on EMS response times will
   likely be greatest for patients currently not well served by EMS systems
   such as individuals living in poor and minority neighborhoods. EMS
   drones can also address other health problems such as delivering
   naloxone for opioid overdoses and blood products for the pre-clinical
   treatment of hemorrhagic shock. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project
   addresses critical barriers to creating a 911-integrated drone service.
   First, it develops algorithms to optimize the spatial distribution of
   drones given performance parameters. Second, it integrates the emergency
   care drone response directly into the 911 dispatch process. The system
   uses state-of-the-art prediction and data integration solutions to
   provide real-time launch decision support and asset tracking
   capabilities to the 911 dispatcher. The result is a drone response
   system that is accurate, fast, and scalable. The project focuses on
   delivering automated external defibrillators to victims of
   out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The decision support system and
   underlying algorithms developed in this work can be applied to other use
   cases integrating drone services into the 911 response.<br/><br/>This
   award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
   support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and
   broader impacts review criteria.

AB The resources, assets, measurement, topology, graphics and other data
   involved in the field of electric distribution and distributed new
   energy have the characteristics of wide sources, multiple types, large
   scale and fast updating. However, the current situation of diversified
   professional solidification models leads to difficulties in electric
   data integration, and the integrated dynamic modeling technology of
   electric data resources needs to be broken through. With the access of
   large-scale distributed new energy to the electric grid, the uncertainty
   of source load of distributed new energy intensifies the complexity of
   time and space of electric distribution resources, format and attribute
   of data resources with time and space, and puts forward higher
   requirements for the dynamic expansion ability and temporal expression
   ability of the data model. At present, the planning, construction and
   operation, operation, distribution and dispatching and other electric
   grid integration data homology technology routes mainly adopt data table
   aggregation, primary key field association and other methods to achieve
   data level integration. With the continuous development of business, the
   electric topology is changing rapidly, and the electric topology data in
   the existing system is also changing. In terms of graphical
   representation, it is urgent to provide topology editing function in the
   front-end interface and publish the electric topology changes in real
   time, so that the whole electric topology planning system can understand
   and master the real-time topology and provide data support for further
   decision-making.

AB In recent years, the use of unmanned vehicles has advanced because of a
   growing number of civil applications such as firefighting or
   non-military security work, such as surveillance of pipelines etc. The
   application of these technologies with decreased cost and size has
   received attention in both civil and military applications. Recent
   advances in sensors, modeling and simulation and availability of
   open-source software and hardware for data integration has created an
   environment of remotely monitoring that was not possible a few years
   ago. This paper examines a niche cost-effective, portable Unmanned
   Surface Vessel that has been designed to capture the bathymetric profile
   of shallow water basins using single beam echosounder. Bathymetry is the
   measurement of the depth of water in oceans, rivers, or lakes.
   Bathymetric maps look a lot like topographic maps, which use lines to
   show the shape and elevation of land features. Today, echo sounders are
   used to make bathymetric measurements. Global shallow water bathymetry
   maps offer critical information to inform activities such as scientific
   research, environment protection, and marine transportation. Accurate
   mapping of shallow bathymetry is critical for understanding and
   characterizing coastal environments providing a foundation for measuring
   underwater light density, mapping and monitoring and planning marine
   operations and transportation. Methods for estimating shallow water
   bathymetry have suffered from a variety of trade-offs and limitations.
   Conventional methods such as shipborne sounding or airborne LiDAR have
   limited spatial coverage. The unit described in this paper has been
   designed and has been trained to acquire data in a predefined set path,
   minimizing the human intervention and the associated errors. A
   successful trial run was done for mapping the bed profile of the river
   basin in India. The vessel has been upskilled for capturing sonar data
   sets, with water quality parameters and soil samples using an automated
   auger. The vessel functions using the combined various open-source
   software and hardware tools for data assimilation, while the captured
   data sets are real- time transferred using IOT to Ground Controlled
   Station. The tropical river basin chosen is a part of Netravati River
   located in Dakshina Kannada District, Karnataka, India. This area is a
   part of the monsoon belt, and the Netravati riverbed is subjected to
   heavy sand deposition during a part of the year. The data on the
   excessive sand deposition is of immense value to the district and state
   administration. This study has been carried out at a frequency of 30
   days and is provided as an input during non- monsoon period for district
   administration for outlining removal of excessive sand deposition
   monitoring of water quality in the estuarine ecosystem. The work done is
   a one-of-a-kind pilot study developed in-house using the recent advances
   seen in the world of open-source platforms. This paper demonstrates a
   unique application that is of value to the state administration in
   decision making and in addition contributes to environmental monitoring
   of the riverbed

   by multiple data sources. A message                integration system
   pushes the generated data to the                data integration system
   in a form of a message. A                database system receives a
   graph data set through a                message subscription and
   distribution technology. A                data set is stored and updated
   in real time. A                decision-making service system calls a
   data result                of the data set of the message data set by
   the                message Subscription and Distribution technology.    
   The decision-making service system integrates the               
   decision result of a decision maker reference                through
   customized association rules and                policy.
   USE - Real-time message processing storage and                decision
   service system for use in a credit                guarantee service
   field. Can also be used for a                large data technology
   field.
   ADVANTAGE - The system realizes real-time message data               
   processing, ensures timeliness and validity of the               
   decision result, and satisfies the requirement of                high
   efficiency so as to solve the credit guarantee                field
   anti-support relationship complex, and                searching speed is
   slow.
   DESCRIPTION Of DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic block diagram 
   of a real-time message processing storage and                decision
   service system. (Drawing includes                non-English language

AB PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTOver 80% of emergency department (ED) patients
   with acute heart failure (AHF) are admitted tothe hospital, with only
   10% at high-risk for in-hospital events. We developed and validated
   aprediction rule (STRATIFY) that identifies ED patients with AHF that
   may be safe to discharge. Ifsuccessfully implemented, it will save
   substantial resources without sacrificing patient outcomesand help
   institutions achieve goals for accountable care. Real-world adoption of
   prediction rulesfor AHF and other conditions treated in the ED is
   challenged by barriers such as time-pressuredworkflow, real-time data
   availability and quality. A solution would have considerable
   implicationsfor implementing any clinical decision algorithm. The
   central objective of this grant is to developa multilevel approach and
   the necessary statistical methods to close the gap in implementationof
   our AHF risk prediction tool, as a model for other automated risk
   prediction approaches withinan electronic health records system. Through
   inter-disciplinary collaboration among EDphysicians, biostatisticians,
   qualitative research experts, implementation scientists
   andbioinformaticians, we propose to rigorously develop and test a
   clinical decision support-basedapproach including 1) robust stakeholder
   engagement to participate in user-centered designand identify approaches
   to overcome barriers to implementation, 2) overcoming real-time
   dataintegration challenges through statistical methods, and 3) a
   detailed evaluation of effectivenessand implementation in multiple

   practice and risk model implementation by closing the gap between
   scientific discovery andhealth care delivery using risk prediction
   tools. Importantly, the methods developed here willgeneralize to other
   risk prediction tools and be readily translatable to other complex

AB PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTIn this proposal, we will use modern machine
   learning techniques to combine and enhancecomputational modeling
   predictions. We will overcome the physics deficiencies that areinherent
   in modeling assumptions by including ground-truth clinical measurements,
   but in turnprovide predictions that are more informative (higher spatial
   and temporal resolution) than theoriginal clinical measurements.
   Furthermore, we will implement this framework as a surrogatemodel that
   can be used in real time and can replace current models with
   prohibitively highcomputation cost. If successful, the proposed research
   will enable lab-to-bedside deployment ofa vast array of existing and
   future computational models and it ultimately could lead to a
   paradigmshift in health care workflow. Our overarching hypothesis is
   that the statistical correlations between computationalmodels and
   clinical measurements can be exploited in a probabilistic data-fusion
   frameworkfor more accurate predictions. Our multi-fidelity framework is
   based on an autoregressiveGaussian Process (GP) scheme. Our proposed
   scheme is a non-parametric Bayesian machinelearning technique that has a
   probabilistic workflow and estimates uncertainty at differentlevels of
   fidelity in a principled manner. As a template for other clinical
   applications, we will develop this framework forperfusion scanning of
   brain hemodynamics in healthy and stroke populations, which has
   asignificant health application. In Aim 1, we will simulate cerebral
   perfusion in healthy andstroke populations based on CT and MR
   angiography (CTA and MRA) scans. We will simulate andvalidate cerebral
   blood perfusion in healthy and stroke gender-balanced subjects. In Aim
   2, weconstruct subject-specific multi-fidelity models by combining
   computational results andperfusion scans. We propose to leverage the
   multi-fidelity model to reduce scan time andradiation exposure by
   incorporating simulated perfusion maps with CT perfusion scans.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infectious disease and one of the
   biggest health problems public policy in the world. TB is curable, and
   most cases of death can be prevented withearly diagnosis and adequate
   treatment. In 2018, in the region of the 13th Department Regional Health
   Department of the State of São Paulo, the total number of confirmed TB
   cases in the Notifiable Diseases Information System, was 537. The main
   outcomes were: 366 cures, 73 abandonments and 19 deaths from TB (BRASIL,
   2019). In this way, they are still research is needed that considers
   operational aspects of the treatment and control of its dissemination.
   Considering this scenario, the need to develop software that provides
   real-time information about the patient's path through the systems
   health information for rapid and adequate clinical decision-making is
   essential. A system that includes information on TB cases in a single
   database, it will provide a regional epidemiological scenario, assisting
   in the action plan against the disease. This is the proposal of the
   research "Digital health for the end TB strategy: from linked data
   integration to a better evidence-based decision making" in which this
   project is inserted. From this so the objective is to evaluate the
   implementation of a single and interoperable system for TB monitoring in
   the municipalities belonging to DRS XIII. (AU)

AB In view of the situation that the maintenance data of substation
   equipment in the process of maintenance are scattered, the operation is
   excessively dependent on labor, and the cost of on-site safety control
   is high, a digital big data analysis platform based on the whole link of
   substation maintenance is proposed. Firstly, the human and material
   information involved in the overhaul of substation equipment is
   analyzed, the subject of overhaul data is determined, and the data
   warehouse is established. Secondly, the design of ETL, the original
   system data, through the extraction, verification, deweighting, loading
   and other steps, uniform aperture in Hive data integration completed;
   Then, the data Cube building engine Cube based on Apache Kylin is
   designed and implemented. Finally, the computing performance of Cube is
   optimized, and the incremental construction method of Cube is proposed
   to ensure the real-time performance of data in Cube. The system can
   reduce the identification rate of data chimney, bad data and wrong
   parameters, which is conducive to restoring the true working state of
   the power system, ensuring the accuracy of decision-making, and
   improving the ability of safe and stable operation of the power system.

   NOVELTY - The system has a processor. A memory stores               
   computer-readable instructions that cause the                system to
   receive (402) sensor data from sensors.                The sensor data
   is preprocessed (404) with a                simplified state estimation
   (SSE) module to                calculate a variance. The SSE module uses
   a machine                learning model trained using a data set. A     
   processing code is generated (408) for the sensor                data
   based on the variance. The processing code is                associated
   with the sensor data. A prioritization                code is associated
   with the sensor data. The sensor                data, the processing
   code, and the prioritization                code are sent (410) to a
   real-time processing                platform. The platform processes
   (412) the sensor                data in an order based on prioritization
   code when                the platform is busy.

AB Currently, approximately 5.8 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease
   and related dementias (ADRD) andare cared for by 16 million family
   members, friends or other unpaid caregivers. Communication deficits
   arecommon among persons with ADRD and are due to a variety of symptoms
   associated with ADRD, including(but not limited to) various types of
   primary progressive aphasia, memory loss, word-retrieval anomia,
   anddecreased attention span. For the persons with ADRD, these deficits
   can lead to a number of poor outcomes,such as depression, social
   isolation, mood and behavioral disturbances, and premature
   institutionalization.Communication deficits also pose challenges to
   caregiving and clinical care, which is already complex. Ourteam has
   previously developed and tested an information technology (IT)
   intervention, called CareHeroes (CH)app that assists caregivers with
   common caregiving challenges and to improve clinical
   communicationbetween ADRD caregivers and providers. The team has
   successfully integrated CH into clinical care at twomemory clinics and
   have translated CH into Spanish. The proposed project builds on this
   previous work bymodifying CH to include an Assistive Alternative
   Communication (AAC) device that relies on touchscreentechnology to
   increase communication by the persons with ADRD about their daily care
   preferences,experiences, and habits. This new interface is customizable
   and grounded in evidence on AAC andtouchscreen-use by persons with
   dementia. Essentially, the CH AAC would compensate for the
   persons’communication deficits by using photographs, graphics and text
   to promote engagement of the person withADRD, promote personhood, and
   offer providers access to real-time, tracked behavioral trends that
   supportearly detection, intervention, and monitoring of community
   dwelling older adults. The study has two SpecificAims: (1) Develop a
   novel, electronic AAC interface for an existing IT intervention (CH)
   that assists the personwith dementia in communicating their daily care
   preferences with caregivers; and communicate everydayhabits and
   behaviors (e.g., sleep quality, appetite, daily activities) with
   providers involved in their care; (2)Examine the impact and conduct a
   pilot study that evaluates biopsychosocial outcomes of 120 triads
   (personwith dementia/ caregivers/providers) utilizing the CH3.0
   intervention as an adjunct to care and caregiving for 12months. Triads
   will be recruited from two memory clinics (Miami, Alabama) where we have
   already integratedthe current version of CH into care for use by
   caregivers and providers. These clinics serve severaldisadvantaged ADRD
   populations (e.g., African American, Hispanic, rural-dwelling). Measures
   will beadministered at baseline, 6 month, and 12 months and focus on
   psychosocial and communication/engagementamong members of the triad and
   we will track all CH3.0 user actions for the 12 month study. The
   projectdesign is highly feasible and cost efficient, given that the
   infrastructure has already been established throughthe team’s currently
   funded (AHRQ R21 HS026571- 9/18- 09/20) study.

AB Currently, approximately 5.8 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease

   arecommon among persons with ADRD and are due to a variety of symptoms
   associated with ADRD, including(but not limited to) various types of
   primary progressive aphasia, memory loss, word-retrieval anomia,
   anddecreased attention span. For the persons with ADRD, these deficits
   can lead to a number of poor outcomes,such as depression, social

AB The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business
   Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to assist with
   preparedness and decision-making for situations like the COVID-19
   pandemic. This health crisis has been exacerbated by a lack of real-time
   information or predictive information about the extent, location, and
   spread of the disease. This Phase I project ingests data streams from
   government agencies, healthcare providers, and the general public,
   returning real-time, actionable information to assist in guiding a broad
   and coordinated response. While this platform is particularly relevant
   in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is disease agnostic, and will have utility
   for seasonal influenza and other infectious diseases, positively
   impacting public health.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation
   Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a platform aimed at
   providing real-time identification of infectious disease outbreaks and
   predictions of disease spread, with an initial focus on COVID-19. Among
   the gaps in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic is capability to
   accurately track the magnitude, location, and spread of infectious
   agents. This project aims to assess and demonstrate the value of
   leveraging multiple modalities and sources of data for early detection
   and prediction of disease outbreaks, with focus on COVID-19. The
   approach will combine data fusion methods and epidemiological modeling
   approaches with continual input from subject matter experts in an effort
   to generate actionable information and predictive models related to
   disease spread. A variety of data streams providing information on
   disease incidence, transportation data, and sub-population interaction
   data will be used to construct progressively more sophisticated SEIR
   models. These efforts will result in an improved understanding of the
   utility and applicability of various data streams to epidemiological
   monitoring and forecasting, as well as platform for users of various
   levels of technical expertise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's

AB The prevalence of high-speed data management and communication systems
   have produced countless large volumes of high-veracity, real-time data
   collections across many domains. For example, natural disasters initiate
   a myriad of human communications, data exchange, and situational
   assessments. It is crucial to quickly collect and analyze all of the
   relevant data, as life or death decisions may rest on the outcome.
   Hurricane Irma in 2017 caused the largest civil evacuation in Florida’s
   history and emphasizes two critical problems in emergency management: 1)
   pre-storm evacuation coordination; and 2) post-storm support for
   shelter-in-place locations. Disaster information integration and fusion
   technologies have the potential to deliver enhanced situational
   awareness tools across all sectors, enabling a more efficient,
   effective, and automated emergency management and recovery process.
   However, there is no discernible approach to identify and exploit the
   underlying patterns of each dataset while also minimizing possible
   drawbacks. This project aims to utilize multimodal data, such as text
   messages, images, videos, traffic information, and geo-referencing
   information, from various sources including social media, news,
   government announcements, and radio broadcasts. This work will
   investigate the analysis and fusion of this information to provide
   useful insights for aiding the decision-making process for both
   residents and government agencies. The goal is to develop new tools and
   technologies that can support emergency managers to better evaluate the
   effectiveness of disaster management policies such as evacuation.
   <br/><br/>The proposed research provides potential solutions to solve
   crucial information analysis challenges related to disaster information
   management while leveraging the team's previous work. In addition, the
   team's research approach offers rapid key information identification,
   efficient multimodal data integration that facilitates emergency
   management, and enhances dynamic community disaster information sharing.
   Moreover, solutions developed could later be extended to other domains
   in the information management field. This project fosters collaboration
   among two institutions, Florida International University (FIU) and
   University of Tokyo, as well as institutions across the public and
   private sectors, to develop advanced techniques for effective emergency
   response and disaster management. The broader impact of this work will
   lead to scientific advances in the preparation, response, recovery, and
   mitigation of major disasters. As the largest graduate Hispanic Serving
   Institution in the continental United States, FIU will also benefit from
   the impact of this project that expands the participation of
   underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The research findings of this
   project will be broadly disseminated via publications, presentations,
   and an organized workshop.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory
   mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
   the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

AB Abstract: Decision-making (DM) in critical environments is a complex
   process that can be simulated due to current telematic capabilities,
   which allow real-time interaction with large amounts of data. This
   document describes the proposed architecture from a research project
   conducted by the Colombian Air Force (FAC) Aerospace Technology
   Development Center for Defense (CETAD). Using computerized and expert
   system tools, such architecture allows creating a real-time computer
   environment for the decision-maker to evaluate their options and prepare
   for real events, simulating characteristics, resources, and strategies.
   This paper describes a research product that resulted in a simulation
   system, based on a combination of fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and
   decision trees. These contribute to modeling and simulating various
   entities and their automatic response according to simulated patterns
   and situations. Then, using operators, the decision-maker can modify
   entity behavior within parameterized restrictions and physical
   conditions. Also, based on business intelligence tools, reports are
   generated to evaluate the decisions made. This type of technology
   improves planning capacity and facilitates the decision-making process.
   The system allows simulating any media deployment in the context of
   national security and critical events. Thus, a case study is developed
   for implementing a support-oriented simulation in a natural disaster
   scenario.
X4 Resumen: El proceso de toma de decisiones (TD) en entornos críticos es
   un proceso complejo que puede ser simulado gracias a las capacidades
   telemáticas actuales, que permiten interactuar con grandes cantidades de
   datos en tiempo real. Este documento describe la arquitectura planteada
   desde un proceso de investigación, desarrollado del Centro de Desarrollo
   de Tecnología Aeroespacial de la FAC (CETAD), que permitió utilizando
   herramientas computarizadas, basados en conocimiento experto, crear un
   entorno en el que el decisor evalué sus opciones preparándose para
   eventos reales, simulando las características del proceso de TD en
   tiempo, recursos y estrategias en un entorno en tiempo real. Este
   documento describe el producto de una investigación que dio como
   resultado un sistema de simulación con una arquitectura basada que
   combina lógica difusa, algoritmos genéticos y árboles de decisiones con
   los que se puede modelar diversas entidades y su respuesta automática de
   acuerdo a los patrones y situaciones simuladas, en la que a través de
   operadores el decisor puede modificar las instrucciones para las
   entidades dentro de unas restricciones parametrizadas que obedecen a
   condiciones físicas. También basado en técnicas de inteligencia de
   negocios, se generan informes para evaluar las decisiones tomadas. Este
   tipo de tecnologías mejora la capacidad de planificación y facilitar el
   proceso de toma de decisiones. Este sistema permite simular cualquier
   despliegue de medios en el contexto de la seguridad nacional y eventos
   críticos. Así, se desarrolló un estudio de caso para la implementación
   de una simulación orientada al soporte en el escenario de un desastre

DT Awarded Grant
PD Apr 01 2020
PY 2020
AB This award will contribute to the national prosperity by investigating a
   framework for factory-level production control using real-time
   equipment-level sensing data. Rapid advances in sensor technology,
   computer-controlled processes, high-performance computing, and
   internet-of-things (IoT) have the potential to improve the productivity
   of U.S. manufacturing significantly. However, current production systems
   remain predominately retrospective and responsive to adverse events
   because real-time analysis has not been sufficiently integrated in
   proactive decision support. This award investigates an approach based on
   hybridizing data-driven statistical methods and with product flow models
   to address the key challenges in real-time sensing, performance
   prediction, and proactive control of production systems. The knowledge
   developed from this research will enhance the understanding of the
   fundamental principles governing manufacturing systems operations from
   both theoretical and practical perspectives. The research is integrated
   with an education plan to enhance education and outreach activities in
   the minority and underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award supports
   fundamental research to advance the state-of-the-art in prognostics,
   data fusion, and real-time production controls at both process and
   system levels in production environments. The research will investigate
   a new data-driven approach that combines Bayesian generative models,
   tensor data analytics, and data-fusion for prognostics to determine a
   process-level health condition index based on heterogeneous sensing data
   at different sampling rates. Process-specific health condition
   information will be integrated with system-level stochastic models for
   production performance prediction by synthesizing the input from sensor
   measurements and the output of process-level prediction. Finally, a
   data-driven sequential decision-making problem will be formulated to
   derive adaptive control actions that optimize the performance at both
   system and process levels in real-time.  The developed methodology will
   be tested and validated using data from a small-scale university lab and
   collaborating industry partners, as well as open data sets published by
   the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<br/><br/>This award
   reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
   through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
   impacts review criteria.

AB The combination of cognitive mm-Wave Dual-Beam (DB) MIMO Phased Array
   systems with optical sensing solutions is proposed, targeting new
   functionalities for environmental perception and ubiquitous
   interactions. The resulting paradigms exploit the fusion of mm-Wave and
   optical sensing solutions to enable emerging technologies facilitating
   interactions of humans with smart devices and systems in randomly
   changing environments. Perspectives for autonomous vehicles with
   Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), including Gesture-Recognition
   (GR), through ubiquitous interactions based on hybrid cognitive mm-Wave
   RFIC technologies and optical systems, are drawn. Several hardware
   realizations of mm-Wave phased-arrays are built and co-assembled with
   optical systems for smart data fusion and real-time signal processing
   for an autonomous secure decision-making process. A unified modeling and
   measurement platform is proposed with the concept of Multi-Physics
   (EM-thermal-mechanical) Numerical-Co-SimulationClone (NCSC), seen as the
   counterpart of the functional hardware, which enables 4D (space-time
   evolution) of augmented reality.

TI TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating
   Information, Care and Safety) trial
DT Awarded Grant
PD May 15 2019
PY 2023
AB AbstractAdverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal
   failure, are common after surgery, andrepresent a serious public health
   challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through
   integrated,collaborative health information technology solutions that
   provide clinicians cognitive and computationalsupport. The chief
   motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR:
   NavigatingInformation, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted
   telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate thedynamic
   assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and
   implement evidence-based practices.The net result for patients would be
   improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called
   theAnesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient
   data integration from the electronichealth record, clinician decision
   support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes,
   andremote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization
   of sophisticated remote monitoring forthe OR is somewhat analogous to an
   air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative
   TECTONICStrial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by
   the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,and the National Science
   Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a
   prototypetelemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support
   alerts for the ACT, based on clinician userfeedback; (iii) designed,
   developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse
   postoperativeoutcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing
   a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT.The TECTONICS trial
   builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we
   can implementand sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we
   will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machinelearning algorithms
   and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when
   patients are at high riskfor experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to
   understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’(anesthesiologists and
   certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking,
   decision-making and behavior.This understanding will help us to enhance
   the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in theOR, and
   improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs.
   Aim 3 is to conduct arigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the
   impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, andclinical
   outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium,
   renal failure, respiratoryfailure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will
   be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of
   atelemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the
   usefulness of incorporating such technology inroutine care of surgical
   patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many
   millions undergoingsurgery yearly, this feasible application of
   technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality
   ofperioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain.

TI Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat
   Infectious Disease
DT Awarded Grant
PD Sep 05 2018
PY 2022
AB Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated
   that it is feasible to predictepidemic disease outbreaks from
   retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we
   cantake climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are
   moving closer to real-time prediction at thepopulation level. But we
   have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual
   patient. Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of
   laboratory testing of individuals. For infectiousdisease, most of such
   testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The
   role oflaboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period
   of time delay. Personalized medicine today isreactive. Complicating
   matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly
   dependent onenvironmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name
   the pathogens we are fighting, but we really needto know the resistance
   characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both
   speciation and resistancecan now be determined from molecular data,
   which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions. We
   here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of
   infectious diseases. Ourhypothesis is that the alternative to
   time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens

TI ADAPTIVE WATER QUALITY SAMPLING WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WITH
   APPLICATIONS TO NITRATE DEPOSITION
DT Awarded Grant
PD Feb 15 2017
PY 2017
AB In the last decade there has been explosive growth in the development of
   low-cost robotic vehicles suitable for environmental observation and
   assessment. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are beginning to
   measure pollutants indicating harmful algal blooms or hazardous septic
   discharge, while unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can soon be used to
   monitor air quality, detect high emission levels or localize building
   infrastructure gas leaks. Enabling such systems to autonomously complete
   time-critical tasks will be of great value for understanding the effects
   on the environment and for continuously tracking prevention and
   restoration efforts. This project specifically focuses on autonomous
   systems that operate in highly dynamic environments where critical
   processes occur over hours and days and tightly couple land use with
   near-shore water quality, for instance during storm-induced run-off
   dumping excess ammonia-based fertilizers from nearby agricultural fields
   to side streams into the water.Current autonomous sampling systems lack
   ways to account for such short-scale dynamic spatio-temporal processes
   in order to accurately identify pollution sources. This is due to the
   complexity of running online modeling and planning algorithms, but also
   due to the cost and required vehicle systems integration efforts. The
   goal of this research is to begin addressing these limitations through
   an integrated framework for environmental modeling and multi-vehicle
   path planning that accounts for time-dependence and land-to-water
   environmental coupling.Approach. Our research combines three
   thrusts:Task 1: Statistical Learning of Latent Environmental Models: We
   will develop computational theory and software tools for real-time
   environmental data fusion into latent variable models encoding unknown
   spatio-temporal concentrations of a quantity of interest such as nitrate
   in the water.Task 2: Time-dependent Cooperative and Informative
   Planning: We will study path planning methods through prediction based
   on the stochastic environment models from T1, in order to determine the
   optimal sampling path and motion, particularly focusing on
   time-dependence and cooperative planning.Task 3: System Validation:
   Nitrogen Influx Assessment with Autonomous Vehicles in the Chesapeake
   Bay: The approach will be validated using a team of three experimental
   robotic platforms with different sensing modalities: an aerial vehicle
   capable of vertical sampling by suspending a cable-driven sonde, a
   surface vehicle measuring bathymetry, and an underwater vehicle with
   multi-parameter and optical nitrate sondes. Validation of the complete
   system from T1 and T2 for nitrate source tracking in the Chesapeake Bay
   will be performed in coordination with the Chesapeake Research
   Consortium, our partner organization.The proposed research will advance
   knowledge of cyber-physical systems and decision making under
   uncertainty through on-line modeling and planning methods for autonomous
   vehicles. The experimental platforms will provide a proof-of-concept for
   autonomous sampling that adaptively computes required spatial and
   temporal scales to capture critical events as they occur in the
   water.The proposed techniques are set to have a significant impact by
   enabling robotic systems to optimally collect information in
   time-critical settings. As a specific application, the proposed system
   will enhance ongoing restoration efforts in the Bay, by discovering and
   tracking pollution sources, and continuously assessing the effectiveness
   of treatment strategies. We will mentor research by undergraduate and
   graduate students and we will provide hands-on research opportunities
   for underrepresented high-school students. The developed computational
   techniques and tools will be generally applicable and will be
   disseminated as open-source (ROS compatible) software libraries.

AB With the growth of the aeronautical industry worldwide, it is important
   task for the next generation of air traffic control systems generating
   technologies that reduce risks and maintain a constant monitoring of
   atmospheric meteorological phenomena.
   Many meteorological phenomena generate risks and delays in air
   operations. An objective here is to provide an overview of the main
   meteorological processes that affect flights seen from the perspective
   of control centers.
   This work presents the development of a methodology that allows the
   automated integration of heterogeneous and asynchronous meteorological
   data, in order to determine the location and characteristics of
   meteorological phenomena and to analyze their behavior in order to
   detect those atmospheric formations that can put in risk air operations.
   For this purpose, artificial intelligence systems are used to extract
   relevant information from several sources such as: meteorological
   satellite images in different spectra; infrared, visual and water vapor;
   Icing models and data from the meteorological gardens of all aerodromes
   in Colombia.
   With all this information, the characteristics of the sources are
   evaluated in real time looking for meteorological formations that could
   be considered as relevant and then they are plotted in a georeferenced
   and organized way on a map. An interference matrix is obtained, which
   summarizes the data obtained from the individual analyzes of each source
   in order to obtain the geolocation of vertical formation of clouds,
   classifying and labeling automatically each formation providing support
   information to experts and other users of the aeronautical ecosystem to
   support decision-making.

AB Roadways subject to seasonal load restrictions are located in remote
   areas where collection and transmission of real-time subsurface data is
   problematic. A demonstration project used wired underground sensors
   connected via cell/satellite transmissions. The present project
   developed radio frequency wireless sensors and transmission systems to
   measure subsurface data. A major advantage with wireless is installation
   simplicity, eliminating the need to trench out the roadway for cables
   from the sensors to a roadside data collection and transmission system.
   Real-time wireless sensor data and environmental data are integrated
   into a Decision Support System designed to assist state Department of
   Transportation (DOT) officials in setting winter weight premiums (WWP)
   and seasonal load restrictions (SLR). WWP and SLR decisions are made
   using forecasting models using computed environmental and subsurface
   parameters. Collected and computed information are displayed on a web
   browser, alerting Maine and New Hampshire DOTs when critical threshold
   values are reached.

TI Biosensor Data Fusion for Real-Time Monitoring of Global
   Neurophysiological Function
DT Awarded Grant
PD Oct 21 2016
PY 2016
AB Real-time detection of acute changes in neurophysiological state, such
   as epileptic seizures, lapses in cognitive ability, acute stress, etc.,
   can ultimately serve to prevent accidents in high-risk occupations that
   require unwavering focus. Such professions include hazardous cargo
   trucking, heavy machinery operation, security and defense, air traffic
   control, etc. Indeed, technology for acquiring rich biosensor data
   streams that capture brain function, e.g., electroencephalography, are
   becoming increasingly portable and noninvasive. These developments
   present an opportunity for implementing not only real-time monitoring,
   but also providing pre-emptive alerts (e.g., smart phone displays),
   which can be used to indicate degradation in physiological states. This
   research has direct applications in biomedical settings - for instance,
   epilepsy, is one of the most common neurological disorders afflicting
   over 50 million people worldwide, including 3 million people in the U.S.
   In about 25 percent of these patients, epileptic seizures are not
   controlled using available medications. Being able to detect (or
   predict) the onset of epileptic seizures would significantly enhance the
   patient's quality of life. In a proof-of-concept study, the novel
   analytical approaches by the research team detected the onset of
   epileptic seizures within 2.5 seconds. In contrast, existing approaches
   have a detection delay exceeding 7 seconds. From a broader perspective,
   the findings of this research can transform the status quo in real-time
   monitoring of neurophysiological function. The multidisciplinary
   research team will strive to provide state-of-the-art research and
   training opportunities for a diverse group of students that bridges the
   gap from engineering to the life and brain sciences. <br/><br/>The
   research team will develop a sensor data fusion approach based on graph
   theoretic topological mapping to combine data acquired from multiple
   biosensors for neurophysiological change point detection. Unlike
   existing approaches, which rely on complex signal pre-processing, the
   graph theoretic approach eschews these computationally demanding steps
   and is therefore more viable in a practical setting. The research team
   will exploit this framework using a data library of high-resolution
   neurophysiological recordings acquired from end users in realistic
   settings that induce shifts in global functional states (e.g., acute
   stress, cognitive exhaustion, and fatigue and so on). The research team
   will integrate automated decision-making approaches in the overall
   schema to synthesize the information and provide easily interpretable
   feedback to the end user (e.g., displays on a smart device).
   Furthermore, the PIs will customize biosensors to accommodate the
   patient's lifestyle.

AB ﻿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major postoperative
   complications (PC) are common and lead to increase in mortality and
   healthcare cost. Some cost-effective strategies, implemented in a timely
   fashion, can ameliorate the risk for PC but the ability to use them
   depends on the timely and accurate identification of those patients at
   greatest risk. Assessment of that risk requires timely, accurate and
   dynamic synthesis of the large amount of clinical information obtained
   throughout the perioperative period. Today it is not possible to predict
   and quantify, for a given patient, a personal and real-time risk for PC
   that integrates preoperative risk with the risk incurred by the
   physiologic response to events during surgery. The interventions that
   could prevent PC are applied without consideration of a patient's
   personal risk profile or often not applied at all because the risk is
   underestimated. There is an abundance of physiologic, laboratory and
   other clinical data in the perioperative electronic health records
   (EHR), but their magnitude and complexity often overwhelms a physicians'
   ability to comprehend and use the information in an optimal and timely
   way. The objective is to develop an intelligent system, composed of
   high- performance computers, algorithms and physicians interacting in
   real time, which can generate usable medical knowledge with both
   increased speed and accuracy using complex clinical data. Our
   multidisciplinary team of scientific experts in medicine and engineering
   will address methodological challenges related to implementation of
   real-time data integration and processing, data analytics and knowledge
   exchange between computers and physicians in the clinical environment.
   There are three specific aims: 1. Refine and validate predictive risk
   models for major complications using EHR integrated with intraoperative
   physiologic time series using a temporal database for 10,000 surgical
   patients. 2. Implement and validate two-way knowledge exchange between
   predictive risk models and physicians. We will design an interactive
   knowledge exchange application that presents the knowledge behind
   predictive models to physicians, while allowing them to input their own
   assessment into the models. 3. Implement and evaluate an intelligent
   perioperative system for automated risk analysis using real-time EHR
   data. In a prospective clinical study of 60 physicians we will validate
   the diagnostic performance of predictive risk models, compare them with
   the physicians' risk assessment and measure change in physicians' risk
   perception after knowledge exchange with the system. This methodology
   will provide a significant step towards personalized perioperative
   medicine by modeling and quantifying the body's responses to surgery
   while using clinical data acquired during routine medical care.

TI CAREER: Information Accuracy and the Use of Social Data in Planning for
   Disaster Response
DT Awarded Grant

PY 2016
AB The focus of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
   award is a new class of decision models capable of harnessing the power
   of uncertain social data for disaster response logistics planning.
   Information critical in planning logistics activities to support
   disaster response has traditionally been gathered via time-consuming
   efforts such as on the ground assessments. The use of social media
   during emergencies enables collecting a larger amount of potentially
   life saving information in a shorter amount of time. Many emergency
   managers have indicated their agency would take action on social data
   only after verifying it. This strategy contradicts the timeliness of
   social data; one of its primary advantages. The products of this
   research will directly address concerns over the usefulness of social
   data in decision making by quantifying the value of considering the
   information at various stages of verification. Results will be
   translated to the first responder community via a simulated game to
   provide a comparative demonstration of response planning with and
   without social data. New generations of engineers will be inspired to
   pursue careers in humanitarian logistics and infiltrate the field with
   social data concepts by integrating games and case studies into courses
   and summer programs and involving students in the
   research.<br/><br/>Novel models for uncertainty in real-time logistics
   planning will be developed that contribute to dynamic and stochastic
   routing in a number of ways. First, traditional assumptions of
   homeostatic probability distributions for modeled random variables do
   not hold, as crowdsourcing efforts constantly provide new information
   regarding the relative degree of belief in the accuracy of uncertain
   social data. Second, the models will allow timely action on uncertain
   requests instead of delaying resource allocation until the complete
   demand scenario is known. Sampling methods to account for these
   differences will be developed. Seminars and expert interviews with the
   first responder community will be conducted to select relevant routing
   problem variants and information formats. These activities will also
   determine a set of social data logistics strategies of practical
   interest to emergency managers, defined as policies that specify to what
   extent social data should be incorporated in a response plan. Developed
   models will be used to assess strategy performance across a diverse set
   of test instances based on real disasters. This will result in the
   identification of scenarios where social data integration can improve
   response efficacy, potentially transforming disaster response with
   methods that enable serving (saving) a larger number of needs (lives) in
   a shorter amount of time.

AB As a new form of sustainable development, the concept "Smart Cities"
   knows a large expansion during the recent years. It represents an urban
   model, refers to all alternative approaches to metropolitan ICTs case to
   enhance quality and performance of urban service for better interaction
   between citizens and government. However, the smart cities based on
   distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions
   of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion
   devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020.
   Real-time data generated from autonomous and distributed sources can
   contain all sorts of imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g.
   imprecision, uncertainty, ignorance and/or incompleteness. Any
   imperfection in data within smart city can have an adverse effect over
   the performance of urban services and decision making. In this context,
   we address in this article the problem of imperfection in smart city
   data. We will focus on handling imperfection during the process of
   information retrieval and data integration and we will create an
   evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the
   efficiency of smart city.

AB According to the electrical characteristics of high energy-consuming
   enterprises and their management requirements, gateway real-time power
   demand, power factor, load rate and electricity consumption are selected
   as the key index data for load management, and a load management system
   is developed using these index data. On the secondary data integration,
   the electricity monitoring data and the electricity consumption data
   were gathered into a unified platform, which provides real-time
   monitoring of electricity workshop, threshold crossing alert, subentry
   statistical analysis, comprehensive ranking and management evaluation
   function. Ranking in the calculation of each power plant workshop, using
   a weighted sum of sub-margin approach, and the establishment by AHP
   evaluation model by three sub-indices, the top layer is the
   decision-making layer, the intermediate one is a layer of the
   guidelines, and the lowermost one is the solution layer. The goal of
   decision-making layer is to reduce the enterprise power business costs,
   the guidelines for the intermediate layer include reducing maximum
   demand value, improving power factor value assessment, reducing the
   average tariff, and reducing electricity fees during an assessment
   cycle, and the solution layer need to achieve the goals of the upper
   layers by the management of the electricity fees, load rate, power
   factor, power demand, and the average load. Using the system, the
   management department of the enterprises can make summary statistics by
   electricity index data, and at the end of the exam period, evaluation
   and reward will be executed according to the ranking result. This system
   can gradually improve the employee energy-saving awareness and power
   efficiency, which can reduce electricity costs for the enterprises.

AB Real-time big data processing is a crucial need of meteorology today. As
   a matter of fact, the weather is a determining factor in decision making
   in different areas such as air or sea transport, so acquiring knowledge
   of the environment in real time is a consequential question. A promising
   approach for big data treatment in real time is based on the concept of
   complex events processing CEP). The CEP aims to identify significant
   events in a cloud of simple and individually detectable events in real
   time. The meteorological variables, constituting simple event's spaces,
   offer significant flow of data to be processed using CEP technologies.
   This real-time data processing is done by phase of their integration
   with weather systems.
   This paper discusses the big data's meteorological aspects, and shows
   the architectural model for integration of weather data and its
   processing in real time.

AB Today's businesses are driving towards real-time data analytics or
   operational BI for competitive advantage. In operational or real-time
   BI, business users demand real-time data in addition to historical data
   for decision-making. This requirement has driven the development of a
   wide range of technologies and architectures designed for real time and
   near real-time data integration, analytics and reporting against large
   data sets. The emergence of big data has, however, rendered existing
   conventional BI tools inefficient and ineffective for big data
   analytics. The inefficiency and ineffectiveness is seen when business
   users are making decisions based on stale and sometimes incomplete data
   sets which potentially lead to slow and poor decision-making. In recent
   years, industry and academia have invented new approaches and
   technologies to process big data such as Hadoop, Spark and NoSQL
   databases. However, the challenge is that none of these new technologies
   is a one-size-fits-all solution. The new technologies are so numerous
   that organisations are faced with the challenge of determining what is
   appropriate for data analytics requirements because big data is still a
   new concept and there are no standard guidelines or frameworks available
   to assist in evaluating and comparing big data technologies. This study
   aims to explore big data analytics and propose evaluation criteria that
   can be used to compare and evaluate technologies for big data analytics.
   To achieve this aim, a literature analysis to understand the concept of
   big data analytics and related technologies was conducted. Qualitative
   as well as quantitative researches were performed by means of interviews
   of BI experts who have big data knowledge and experience, and by
   experimental research in a laboratory, respectively. The purpose of the
   interviews was to determine which technologies are being used for big
   data analytics and what criteria organisations use when choosing a
   technology. Although most organisations are still entrenched in
   traditional BI technologies, some organisations have started changing
   their data analytics systems to technologies such as Hadoop, NoSQL
   databases and In-memory databases. The results from the interviews
   revealed 18 evaluation criteria but the following criteria were
   indicated as important by the participants, namely, (1) system
   performance regarding latency and throughput, (2) memory consumption,
   (3) CPU utilisation, (4) disk I/O, (5) scalability and (6) fault
   tolerance. Furthermore, a comparative computer laboratory experiment was
   conducted to compare three tools which run on top Hadoop: Hive, Impala
   and Spark. The purpose of the experiment was to test if memory
   consumption, CPU utilisations and system performance are different for
   the three tools when analysing the same amount of data using the same
   computer resources. The results indicated that the three tools'
   performance and resource consumption is significantly different. This
   confirmed that system performance, memory consumption and CPU
   utilisations can be used as criteria to compare and evaluate big data
   technologies.

AB The data fusion community have introduced multiple procedures of
   situational assessments to facilitate timely responses to emerging
   situations. Process Refinement (level 4) of the Joint Directors of
   Laboratories (JDL) is a meta-process used to assess and improve the data
   fusion task during a real-time operation. The User Refinement (level 5)
   of the JDL is intended to address knowledge representation for the
   decision-making resources. In this regard, we have proposed a
   performance metric to direct the analysts' attention about any ranking
   capability issues that may occur during a real-time operation.
   This paper discusses the interaction between machine projection and user
   perception. In particular, it is conducting a reliability-based
   evaluation to examine the proposed scoring scheme against the operators
   comprehension. The Ranking Capability Score (RCS) has successfully
   quantified different ranking instances appropriately. However, it
   provides incomprehensible scores for the analysis team, specifically,
   under a situational assessment where the number of prioritized events is
   dynamically shifted in a multi-projection environment.

AB The data fusion community has introduced multiple procedures of
   situational assessments; this is to facilitate timely responses to
   emerging situations. More directly, the process refinement of the Joint
   Directors of Laboratories (JDL) is a meta-process to assess and improve
   the data fusion task during real-time operation. In other wording, it is
   an optimisation technique to verify the overall data fusion performance,
   and enhance it toward the top goals of the decision-making resources.
   This paper discusses the theoretical concept of prioritisation. Where
   the analysts team is required to keep an up to date with the dynamically
   changing environment, concerning different domains such as air, sea,
   land, space and cyberspace. Furthermore, it demonstrates an illustration
   example of how various tracking activities are ranked, simultaneously
   into a predetermined order. Specifically, it presents a modelling scheme
   for a case study based scenario, where the real-time system is reporting
   different classes of prioritised events. Followed by a performance
   metrics for evaluating the prioritisation process of situational
   awareness (SWA) domain. The proposed performance metrics has been
   designed and evaluated using an analytical approach. The modelling
   scheme represents the situational awareness system outputs
   mathematically, in the form of a list of activities. Such methods
   allowed the evaluation process to conduct a rigorous analysis of the
   prioritisation process, despite any constrained related to a
   domain-specific configuration.
   After conducted three levels of assessments over three separates
   scenario, The Prioritisation Capability Score (PCS) has provided an
   appropriate scoring scheme for different ranking instances, Indeed, from
   the data fusion perspectives, the proposed metric has assessed real-time
   system performance adequately, and it is capable of conducting a
   verification process, to direct the operator's attention to any issue,
   concerning the prioritisation capability of situational awareness
   domain.

AB With the development of electric power industry, power cable will play a
   more and more important role not only widely used in distribution
   network, but also in the field of AC/DC and high voltage transimission
   system. Power cable is generally underground or underwater, the problem
   that fault concealment and long time troubleshooting make serious impact
   on the power supply reliability of power system. Evaluate real-time
   operation state of power cable by using multi-parameters from variety of
   monitoring and detection information, and strengthen early defect
   equipment monitoring on the basis of evaluation result, it can reduce
   equipment failure rate and prevent accident expanding and it has very
   important significance for improving power supply reliability, From the
   perspective of information fusion, the method of evaluation algorithm
   based on RBF (Radial basis function) neural network is proposed.
   Multi-parameter including online detection data, environmental factors,
   testing and equipment information is used to conduct a comprehensive
   evaluation on cable status. The method using data fusion in
   decision-making level by RBF neural network for results of different
   algorithms including catastrophe theory and ANP fuzzy theory can make up
   applicability problem of different evaluation algorithm, and achieve
   complementary functions between the algorithms. To further adapt to the
   actual conditions of parameters, the integrity of input parameters was
   associated to credibility of evaluation results, it will make evaluation
   results more complete. The affectivity of the algorithm was verified by
   practical data.

AB The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop
   physical-statistical models of cardiovascular systems for optimizing
   medical decision making in spatiotemporal disease processes. Multi-scale
   computer models will be developed to improve the understanding of
   disease-altered cardiac electrical dynamics. In particular, the modeling
   will be done in multiple physical levels starting with ion channels,
   then cells, then tissues, and finally an anatomically realistic heart.
   Physics-based models will be statistically calibrated and adjusted so as
   to make more realistic predictions. Furthermore, an easy-to-evaluate
   statistical surrogate model will be developed for faster approximation,
   prediction and optimization, thereby facilitating real-time medical
   decision making. Physical-statistical models will be used in conjunction
   with sensor-based data fusion to optimize cardiovascular diagnostics.
   The simulation-based optimization approach provides a unique opportunity
   to search the optimal medical decisions with the "virtual" heart, as
   opposed to traditional "experience-based", "trial-and-error" or
   subjective decisions in the real-world heart. <br/><br/>If successful,
   the results of this research will yield a fundamental understanding of
   the progression of cardiac diseases that is so vitally needed to improve
   preventive healthcare services. This research has the potential to make
   a paradigm shift in healthcare, i.e., from reactive care to preventive
   and proactive care, from experience-based to evidence-based cardiac care
   services. The early identification of cardiovascular diseases will
   decrease mortality rates, promote the timely delivery of life-saving
   interventions, and reduce healthcare cost (e.g., preventive care in lieu
   of expensive surgical interventions). This will positively impact
   cardiovascular patients, the largest population at risk of death in the
   US and in the world. This project will provide students with a unique
   opportunity to obtain multidisciplinary training in industrial and
   systems engineering, healthcare, statistics and optimization.

TI Biosensor Data Fusion for Real-Time Monitoring of Global
   Neurophysiological Function
DT Awarded Grant

AB Real-time detection of acute changes in neurophysiological state, such
   as epileptic seizures, lapses in cognitive ability, acute stress, etc.,
   can ultimately serve to prevent accidents in high-risk occupations that
   require unwavering focus. Such professions include hazardous cargo
   trucking, heavy machinery operation, security and defense, air traffic
   control, etc. Indeed, technology for acquiring rich biosensor data
   streams that capture brain function, e.g., electroencephalography, are
   becoming increasingly portable and noninvasive. These developments
   present an opportunity for implementing not only real-time monitoring,
   but also providing pre-emptive alerts (e.g., smart phone displays),
   which can be used to indicate degradation in physiological states. This
   research has direct applications in biomedical settings - for instance,
   epilepsy, is one of the most common neurological disorders afflicting
   over 50 million people worldwide, including 3 million people in the U.S.
   In about 25 percent of these patients, epileptic seizures are not
   controlled using available medications. Being able to detect (or
   predict) the onset of epileptic seizures would significantly enhance the
   patient's quality of life. In a proof-of-concept study, the novel
   analytical approaches by the research team detected the onset of
   epileptic seizures within 2.5 seconds. In contrast, existing approaches
   have a detection delay exceeding 7 seconds. From a broader perspective,
   the findings of this research can transform the status quo in real-time
   monitoring of neurophysiological function. The multidisciplinary
   research team will strive to provide state-of-the-art research and
   training opportunities for a diverse group of students that bridges the
   gap from engineering to the life and brain sciences. <br/><br/>The
   research team will develop a sensor data fusion approach based on graph
   theoretic topological mapping to combine data acquired from multiple
   biosensors for neurophysiological change point detection. Unlike
   existing approaches, which rely on complex signal pre-processing, the
   graph theoretic approach eschews these computationally demanding steps
   and is therefore more viable in a practical setting. The research team
   will exploit this framework using a data library of high-resolution
   neurophysiological recordings acquired from end users in realistic
   settings that induce shifts in global functional states (e.g., acute
   stress, cognitive exhaustion, and fatigue and so on). The research team
   will integrate automated decision-making approaches in the overall
   schema to synthesize the information and provide easily interpretable
   feedback to the end user (e.g., displays on a smart device).
   Furthermore, the PIs will customize biosensors to accommodate the
   patient's lifestyle.

   simulation models used within the enterprise information system. The
   integration problem is presented on one sample class of models - the
   real time models that are used in control, diagnostics and decision
   making processes. The suggested method is based on multi-agent approach
   with distributed knowledgeable agents. The dynamic model consists in the
   multi-agent resource conversion process model that supports
   multi-approach modeling, including discrete-event, agent-based, queuing
   systems. To substantiate suggested technical decision of the integration
   module existing message brokers were analyzed. The subject area ontology
   is presented. It is used for semantic data integration that is required
   for simulation modeling of technological processes, business processes
   and logistical processes. In order to achieve a cross-platform system
   Java language is used for development.

   surface-wave (HFSW) radars could be cost-effective sensors for

   In this paper, multi-target tracking and data fusion techniques are
   applied to real data recorded by three low-power HFSW radars installed
   in the German Bight of the North Sea. Ship reports from the automatic
   identification system (AIS) are exploited as ground truth information
   for assessing system performances. Both in situ and model data are used
   to investigate the capabilities of the systems according to the
   variations of the meteorological and oceanographic conditions.
   Preliminary results are presented and discussed, together with an

   decision making and enterprise policy. But if new system is added in
   cloud environment, much cost and time is needed due to heterogenous
   characteristics in data integration. This paper suggests a data cleaning
   system for business intelligence in cloud environment. The proposed
   system minimizes the effect of local system when it integrates
   distributed system using XMDR-DAI. And this system provides standardized
   information to generate information of data warehouse in real time. Also
   the proposed system saves cost and time by integrating the data without
   a change of existed system. And it can improve quality of information by
   generating coherent information through data extraction and cleaning
   work in real time.
AK 클라우드 환경에서 비즈니스 인텔리전스를 위한 DW(Data Warehouse)는 기업 내에 데이터를 의사결정, 기업 정책을

   통합하여 비용과 시간을 절감하고, 실시간 데이터 추출 및 정제 작업을 통한 일관성 있는 실시간 정보를 생성하여 정보의 품질의
   향상시킬 수 있도록 한다.

AB In this paper, we consider scenarios, requirements, and architectures
   for future connected vehicles. Regarding scenarios, we discuss new
   features like autonomous driving, which have very strong requirements on
   sensor data fusion, real-time processing, and the complexity of the
   decision making process. We also address a major trend in automotive
   architectures, which is the aggregation of computing inside the vehicle.
   Furthermore, we consider connected vehicles, where functionality can be
   taken over by the cloud. This leads to new challenges with respect to
   allocation of real-time data processing and control as well as the
   distribution of the strategy layer across the tiers. To address the
   challenges of these novel scenarios, we propose a 3-tier architecture
   for future connected vehicles.

TI Research Initiation Awards: Spatial-temporal Information Fusion and
   Real-time Sensor Data Assimilation Using Sequential Monte Carlo Methods
DT Awarded Grant
PD Aug 15 2013
PY 2013
AB The Research Initiation Award project entitled - Spatial-temporal
   Information Fusion and Real-time Sensor Data Assimilation Using
   Sequential Monte Carlo Methods - has the overarching goal to develop
   tractable approaches for spatial-temporal information fusion and real
   time sensor data assimilation using state of the art probabilistic
   techniques based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. New algorithms
   and methods will be developed to enhance the effectiveness and
   efficiency of information fusion and data assimilation for large-scale
   spatial temporal systems. A special focus is to effectively use
   real-time information and sensor data from geographically distributed
   data sources for more accurate state inference using SMC methods.
   Specific objectives of this project include: developing innovative
   algorithms to exploit the spatial-temporal state of a system for more
   effective sampling/resampling and convergence of SMC methods; developing
   advanced data integration methods to support assimilating real-time
   information and sensor data from distributed data sources;  and
   developing new computing methods and infrastructure based on parallel
   environment to enhance performance of large-scale information fusion and
   data assimilation.<br/><br/>The project promises to have an impact on
   both theoretical and practical aspects of spatial-temporal information
   fusion and real time sensor data assimilation. The newly developed
   methods will increase the capability of seamlessly integrating real time
   data streams to support better analysis and prediction and real time
   decision making. The project involves undergraduate students by training
   them to conduct research in a stepwise manner, broadening their network,
   and preparing them for graduate studies or the workforce. The project
   will enhance the teaching of computer science classes on campus of
   Voorhees College by remotely accessing the cluster system at Georgia
   State University on which students can run parallel and distributed
   programs.

TI III: Small: Collaborative Research: Conflicts to Harmony: Integrating
   Massive Data by Trustworthiness Estimation and Truth Discovery
DT Awarded Grant
PD Aug 01 2013
PY 2013
AB Big data leads to big challenges, not only in the volume of data but
   also in its dynamics and variety. Multiple descriptions about the same
   set of objects or events from different sources unavoidably lead to data
   or information inconsistency. Then, among conflicting pieces of data or
   information, it is crucial to tell which data source is reliable or
   which piece of information is correct. Accurate information is referred
   to as the truth and the chance of a source providing accurate
   information is denoted as source reliability or trustworthiness. The
   objective of this project is to detect truths without supervision, by
   integrating source reliability estimation and truth finding. A unified
   framework is developed to model complex trustworthiness factors,
   heterogeneous data types, incremental and parallel computation, and
   source and data dependencies so that truth and trustworthiness can be
   inferred from multiple conflicting sources of heterogeneous, disparate,
   correlated, gigantic, scattered, and streaming data.<br/><br/>This
   project makes tangible contributions to data integration, information
   understanding and decision making, and benefits many applications where
   critical decisions have to be made based on the correct information
   extracted from diverse sources. Research results of this project are
   integrated into course materials and projects, and into training
   students and new generation researchers, especially female and minority
   students. For further information about this project, please refer to

TI Collaborative Research: Physical-Statistical Modeling and Optimization

DT Awarded Grant
PD Aug 01 2013
PY 2013
AB The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop
   physical-statistical models of cardiovascular systems for optimizing
   medical decision making in spatiotemporal disease processes. Multi-scale
   computer models will be developed to improve the understanding of
   disease-altered cardiac electrical dynamics. In particular, the modeling
   will be done in multiple physical levels starting with ion channels,
   then cells, then tissues, and finally an anatomically realistic heart.
   Physics-based models will be statistically calibrated and adjusted so as
   to make more realistic predictions. Furthermore, an easy-to-evaluate
   statistical surrogate model will be developed for faster approximation,
   prediction and optimization, thereby facilitating real-time medical
   decision making. Physical-statistical models will be used in conjunction
   with sensor-based data fusion to optimize cardiovascular diagnostics.
   The simulation-based optimization approach provides a unique opportunity
   to search the optimal medical decisions with the "virtual" heart, as
   opposed to traditional "experience-based", "trial-and-error" or
   subjective decisions in the real-world heart. <br/><br/>If successful,
   the results of this research will yield a fundamental understanding of
   the progression of cardiac diseases that is so vitally needed to improve
   preventive healthcare services. This research has the potential to make
   a paradigm shift in healthcare, i.e., from reactive care to preventive
   and proactive care, from experience-based to evidence-based cardiac care
   services. The early identification of cardiovascular diseases will
   decrease mortality rates, promote the timely delivery of life-saving
   interventions, and reduce healthcare cost (e.g., preventive care in lieu
   of expensive surgical interventions). This will positively impact
   cardiovascular patients, the largest population at risk of death in the
   US and in the world. This project will provide students with a unique
   opportunity to obtain multidisciplinary training in industrial and
   systems engineering, healthcare, statistics and optimization.

TI SBIR Phase I: Real-Time Data Fusion for Water Supply Systems:
   Innovations for Online Automated Water Quality Model Estimation
DT Awarded Grant
PD Jul 01 2013
PY 2013
AB The innovation will enable real-time decision support for large-scale
   water infrastructure systems, through the fusion of operational data and
   infrastructure-aware predictive models. These real-time software
   instruments will leverage significant investments by drinking water
   utilities in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
   that support operational decisions and Geographic Information Systems
   and infrastructure models that support infrastructure planning; these
   investments should and can be leveraged to support a wider scope of
   utility decision making. This SBIR Phase I proposal focuses on the
   commercial technology associated with real-time predictions of water
   quality evolution within water supply systems. Previous field scale
   evaluations of network water quality models have suffered from idealized
   reaction kinetics; short data collection periods; and significant
   parameter uncertainty and variability. By fusing operational data and
   infrastructure-aware predictive models, this study will, for the first
   time, develop a rigorous assessment of the fidelity of complex network
   water quality models. The data fusion software instruments inspired by
   this research will support the transparent integration of operational
   decisions with real-time data and model predictions and forecasts,
   leading to enhanced water quality benefits that, at present, can only be
   anticipated.<br/><br/>The commercial impact and practical benefits of
   fusing real-time operational data with infrastructure-aware predictive
   models will be enabled by the ability to simply and accurately forecast
   distribution system hydraulics and water quality, in real-time. This
   technology will allow operators to routinely engage in situational
   response training, and conduct operational analyses to achieve practical
   water quality management goals ? such as maintenance of minimum chlorine
   residuals or control of disinfection byproducts. Engineers will apply
   their infrastructure knowledge to these tasks in a collaborative
   fashion, while knowing their infrastructure models are continuously
   updated through a persistent interpretation of the operational record.
   Managers will review dashboards and automated reports showing trends in
   unaccounted for water, energy usage, and water quality, and integrate
   those with past and future asset management decisions. Successful
   completion of Phases I and II of this project will test the value
   proposition for real-time data fusion for water supply systems,
   specifically for real-time network water quality prediction and
   forecasts. Real-time data fusion benefits and associated workflows will
   be put to the test in actual operating environments, supported by a new
   data fusion system that allows for efficient utility workflows across
   the organization.

AB In a coalition context, data fusion involves combining of soft (e. g.,
   field reports, intelligence reports) and hard (e. g., acoustic, imagery)
   sensory data such that the resulting output is better than what it would
   have been if the data are taken individually. However, due to the lack
   of explicit semantics attached with such data, it is difficult to
   automatically disseminate and put the right contextual data in the hands
   of the decision makers. In order to understand the data, explicit
   meaning needs to be added by means of categorizing and/or classifying
   the data in relationship to each other from base reference sources.
   In this paper, we present a semantic framework that provides automated
   mechanisms to expose real-time raw data effectively by presenting
   appropriate information needed for a given situation so that an informed
   decision could be made effectively. The system utilizes controlled
   natural language capabilities provided by the ITA (International
   Technology Alliance) Controlled English (CE) toolkit to provide a
   human-friendly semantic representation of messages so that the messages
   can be directly processed in human/machine hybrid environments. The
   Real-time Semantic Enrichment (RTSE) service adds relevant contextual
   information to raw data streams from domain knowledge bases using
   declarative rules. The rules define how the added semantics and context
   information are derived and stored in a semantic knowledge base. The
   software framework exposes contextual information from a variety of hard
   and soft data sources in a fast, reliable manner so that an informed
   decision can be made using semantic queries in intelligent software
   systems.

   AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS
DT Awarded Grant
PD Oct 24 2012
PY 2012
AB Autonomous intelligent systems will find important applications in our
   future society. Initial applications will be in the following areas:
   surveillance, intelligence gathering and operational control in the
   areas of disaster mitigation (earthquake, nuclear catastrophe, military
   combat, oil-spills at sea, transport infrastructure breakdown, analysis
   and assistance with terrorist attacks), space exploration at remote
   locations (at Trojan asteroids, on Mars and in orbit observations around
   planets, deep underwater explorations and robotics for offshore oil
   exploration disasters) followed by large scale applications such as
   agricultural, search and rescue, manufacturing, and autonomous household
   robots. These autonomous system will require quick, appropriate, and at
   the same time informative-to-partners, actions by teams of robots. They
   can also be computing network based intelligent agents with sensing and
   control capabilities. It will be a societal requirement that these
   (semi-)autonomously operating systems to inform their human supervisors
   about the reasoning behind their actions and their future plans in
   concise notes for their safety and acceptability by society.  Network
   based software agents have been in use by our society for some time. Our
   society is going through information exchange revolution that is
   developing towards networked intelligent devices. Many of these
   infrastructure systems are based on well defined discrete inputs and
   outputs either from human operators or from low dimensional sensor
   measurements. Little progress has however been made in robot
   intelligence of autonomy where high complexity, changing environment is
   to be sensed, reasoned about and acted upon quickly. Partial results
   have been reported in DARPA, Robocup projects that do not provide
   comprehensive systematic approach or are not fully publicly available.
   Progress has only been made in heavily infrastructured environments of
   robots.   We do not yet have the methodology for a set of autonomous
   vehicles or agent systems to operate reliably and (semi-)autonomously in
   complex infrastructure-free environments to solve problems efficiently
   with minimal human supervision. The reason is that current intelligent
   agent technology does not provide solutions. Sensor networks with simple
   computational nodes, that were developed for low power and computational
   resources do not provide solutions. They miss the ability of high
   complexity conceptual abstractions onboard a single agent. The
   computations of these type of agents cannot be substituted by data
   fusion of low complexity agents due to typical real-time and
   communication bottlenecks. Methods of multi-agent decentralized decision
   theory have been developed and very successfully used prior to this
   project but have not been properly exploited for multiple complex
   agents.  This project intends to develop a new methodology for
   autonomous cooperating multi-agent systems that is to boost the
   technological capabilities of our partner companies and the robotics
   industry in general. The project will provide the missing capabilities
   of abstractions concerning world modeling, situational awareness,
   learning and information management onboard a single agent. These
   capabilities will enable efficient realtime decision making within
   multi-agent cooperation and decentralized decision making in poorly
   structured or infrastructure free environments. These methods will
   connect digital computing power with human conceptual structures to
   enable robots to model the world with layers of high and low level
   concepts as humans do.

AB The Tracking and Evaluation (TE) Core of the West Virginia Clinical and

   building evaluation and accountability frameworks to assist all cores
   intheir evaluation and data-based decision-making processes, empowering
   core personnel to recognize andaddress challenges to productivity and
   desired outcomes. No evaluation entity with the infrastructure
   andresources to accomplish programmatic evaluation at this scale existed
   here prior to WVCTSI funding. DuringYears 1-10, TE Core established
   robust systems and processes to provide leadership and personnel
   withobjective performance data to assess progress toward Aim
   achievement. In this second renewal application, TEproposes innovative
   new initiatives to enhance the WVCTSI’s capacity to evaluate its
   progress, maximizingaccountability and programmatic improvement. These
   efforts will be accomplished through the following specificaims: 1)
   Leverage creative existing platforms to further increase capacity among
   WVCTSI personnel outside ofTE Core to rapidly translate evaluation
   findings to practice through innovative evaluation data science
   resourcesand regular evaluation data use training workshops; 2) Drive
   quality improvements in WVCTSI services andsupport through
   investigator-centric programmatic evaluation that enables
   clinical/translational (C/T) investigatorproductivity; and 3) Develop
   and a disseminate portable toolkit of programmatic evaluation models
   that drivecontinuous quality improvement and demonstrate statewide
   impact on rural health and healthcare. For aim 1,TE Core will increase
   the capacity of WVCTSI personnel to rapidly translate evaluation
   findings to practice byidentifying recurring evaluation data needs and
   developing user-friendly web-based data science resources thatprovide
   data visualizations in near real-time and also providing regular
   training in utilization of these resourcesand data-based evaluative
   thinking. For aim 2, TE Core will develop a central database logging
   every instanceof service delivery to investigators and associating that
   data with all other investigator data points. Analyses ofthese data will
   guide qualitative work with investigators to identify and remove
   barriers to their productivitythrough improved services and service
   delivery by all cores. For aim 3, TE Core will develop and package
   forportability two evaluation data models that focus on a) PBRN
   connectivity and impact on rural health andhealthcare, and b)
   hub-and-spoke knowledge transmission to support rural health care
   providers and positivelyimpact their patients. Three key innovations
   involve: a) sophisticated data science tools and evaluation
   capacitybuilding to rapidly translate evaluation findings to practice,
   b) driving quality improvement through investigator-centric programmatic
   evaluation, and c) disseminating a portable toolkit for programmatic
   evaluation in ruralhealth and healthcare settings. Integrating these key
   innovations into the programmatic evaluation developedduring the current
   WVCTSI funding cycle will allow rapid transformation of WVCTSI toward
   sustainability andaccomplishment of the overall programmatic goals of
   this application.

   agents.  This project intends to develop a new methodology for
   autonomous cooperating multi-agent systems that is to boost the
   technological capabilities of our partner companies and the robotics
   industry in general. The project will provide the missing capabilities
   of abstractions concerning world modeling, situational awareness,
   learning and information management onboard a single agent. These
   capabilities will enable efficient realtime decision making within
   multi-agent cooperation and decentralized decision making in poorly
   structured or infrastructure free environments. These methods will
   connect digital computing power with human conceptual structures to
   enable robots to model the world with layers of high and low level
   concepts as humans do.

TI Intelligent and Integrated Condition Monitoring of Distributed
   Generation Systems
DT Awarded Grant

AB Distributed electricity generation (DG) will play a significant role in
   future electric power system, as this type of power generation
   technology can provide electric power by utilising a wide range of
   renewable energy sources at a site close to end users. Considerable
   advances have been achieved during past decades in the capacity, scale
   and location of DG systems, e.g. from onshore to offshore. One of the
   most critical challenges for the deployment of DG systems relates
   specifically to availability and reliability in order to sustain energy
   generation and maximise a long service life of the energy systems
   unattended. This has, therefore, placed higher demand on predictive
   maintenance from innovative condition monitoring systems and solutions
   to tackle new arising challenges in this area.  The research proposed in
   this first grant scheme application represents an effort to explore key
   issues of generic importance to condition monitoring techniques
   optimised for fault detection and diagnosis. The research is oriented
   towards DG systems with wind turbines being the DG sources as this
   particular application presents a number of realistic challenges.
   Firstly, measurement signals would exhibit strong non-stationary
   behaviour due to the intermittent nature of wind sources and
   fluctuations of grid system. Secondly, the signals of small magnitude
   may indicate a start of a significant failure, which are normally
   undetected by conventional methods particularly in a harsh environment.
   Thirdly, large volume of data needs to be processed and transmitted
   especially for continuous online monitoring. For example, if we assume
   that 250 points are required for a typical 2 MW wind turbine to monitor
   most subsystems of a turbine, this will give rise to 36 million data per
   day for a 1 GW wind farm under a sampling rate of 5 minutes.
   Furthermore, a critical issue needing urgent attention will be the
   health problems of the sensor system, which requires that the monitoring
   techniques should be assessing what is happening when some of the
   sensors read data incorrectly.  In order to meet such diversified
   requirements, we plan to use and apply windowed transform, a technique
   well known for its ability to extract nonstationary components in the
   measurement data. By the optimal selection of a window shape, automatic
   windowed wavelet transforms can be achieved to accommodate different
   sensor data for better feature localisation, extraction and correlation.
   Although an incipient fault signal is usually of low magnitude and short
   duration, it would essentially carry the same features as the large
   ones, such as the regularity. If we can design a suitable algorithm to
   match the local regularity or singularity of a signal, any incipient
   faults, abnormalities and disorders can be detected irrespective of
   their magnitude and time duration.   The project is also concerned with
   designing a hybrid neuro-fuzzy method for optimal sensor data fusion.
   The use of this artificial intelligence method can best correlate sensor
   data and predict the unknowns by systematic incorporation of priori
   information. Minimising the number of sensors whilst still maintaining a
   sufficient number to assess the system's conditions can not only
   minimise the complexity of sensor systems but it can also reduce data
   storage requirements. The final part of the project relates specially to
   the practical aspect, where the proposed algorithms are validated in
   real time for online monitoring purposes on a modular embedded system.
   The proposed condition monitoring system in this project would
   accommodate all monitoring techniques within one hardware module, which
   can be readily adapted to other applications.   The project will provide
   better sensing techniques and improved algorithms towards real
   applications by improving our understanding of how to engineer them in
   order to aid the decision making process with respect to asset
   maintenance and management of existing and future DG systems.

AB This paper presents extended GinisSense architecture applied for the
   prediction of electric power supply system behaviour. The original
   GinisSense architecture is a Sensor Web based architecture for
   collecting, processing, analyzing, decision making and alerting based on
   the data received from heterogeneous data sources. This architecture was
   extended in order to process data from various IT systems present in
   power supply companies and sensors attached on power supply network
   elements. This allowed us to manage a large amount of data, both
   archived and real time, extract valuable information from raw data and
   perform rules based reasoning for the prediction of power supply system
   behaviour.
   The behaviour prediction process consists of four steps, defined
   according to Omnibus data fusion model. These steps lead to generation
   of events, where each event represents the possible future state of the
   power supply system indicating vulnerability of individual power supply
   network elements. By means of specialized Web GIS application, user is
   presented with the geographical area containing power supply network
   elements with the potential for the hazardous events.
   Within this paper, we demonstrate the architecture with a scenario
   generated in a laboratory conditions. For demonstration purposes, the
   necessary subset of data was transferred from the power supply company
   database to the laboratory conditions and the electrical values were
   collected from the local data warehouse during the simulation of
   hazardous events.

AB Logistics mode has become a key element to the success of B2C(Business
   to Customer) e-commerce, but few studies have focused on the selection
   of logistics mode with a comprehensive method for B2C e-commerce. An
   effort is devoted to classifying logistics modes into six categories:
   market exchanges, customized logistics, logistics outsourcing, logistics
   alliance, joint venture and in-house logistics and to figuring out the
   influencing factors related to the selection of logistics mode. It is
   concluded that both qualitative and quantitative factors are important
   for effective logistics mode selection. A two-stage model based on
   AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process) and DEA(Data Envelopment Analysis) is
   then developed to choose an appropriate mode. AHP method produces the
   weights of the six modes by analyzing these qualitative factors and DEA
   method gets the effective candidate modes through quantitative analyses.
   After that, a relative case is designed to test and verify the
   effectiveness of this model. Result shows that the AHP/DEA model can
   obviously lead to a more rational choice and simplify the process to
   make decisions.

   experts' cognitive process in decision-making and analysis, the
   intelligent decision analysis models of drilling complex circs and
   accident are built by use of case-based reasoning technique. And based
   on these, a cooperative decision-making and analysis support platform is
   provided for multi-domain experts in oil filed base. This platform,
   which can make full use of all types of existing decision-making method,
   cases, multi-domain experts' experience and knowledge for drilling
   complex circs and accident, can gather relevant experts in different
   places or software systems to cooperatively work online, so as to
   enhance the diagnosing and processing of drilling complex circs and
   accident in terms of science, accuracy and real-time. The system's
   architecture, functions, approach of organizing network and main
   realization technology, including data integration and sharing, protocol
   of data transferring, case expression, case base organizing and
   case-based reasoning decision-making and so forth, were in detail
   described.

AB Traffic information service plays an important role in one's daily life.
   However, traffic information processing is very complicated because of
   its dynamic, cooperative and distributed features. This paper presents
   the Service and Monitoring Oriented Traffic Information Grid. In this
   system, it is a remarkable characteristic to provide real-time, dynamic
   information services for travelers and traffic managers by grid
   technology. The system provides travelers with services of optimized
   route scheme, bus arrival prediction based on real-time route status,
   and route status forecast. For traffic managers, the system can provide
   vehicle tracing, traffic monitoring, history data analysis, and decision
   making on traffic control strategy. In this regard, key research
   includes large multi-source traffic data integration, route status
   forecast, and optimum dynamic travel scheme implementation based on
   massive GPS data.

AB This research focuses on understanding noisy nonlinear dynamical systems
   using multidisciplinary approaches from advanced measurement
   capabilities, modeling, and simulations. The unique features of the
   problem are interactions between information collection, information
   fusion and information assimilation. The subtleties of the interaction
   between these effects will lead to new and novel analytical techniques.
   The approach is to (1) develop novel data-driven lower-order modeling
   and multi-scale nonlinear filtering frameworks using probability-based
   decision-making approaches for state estimation of the power system; (2)
   develop new algorithms and tools for the distributed collection,
   sharing, mining and harnessing of data for cooperative health monitoring
   and vulnerability assessment of power systems in real time; and (3)
   enhance overall power system dynamic performance and stability through
   novel data fusion techniques and particle methods which are specifically
   adapted to the complexities of the underlying dynamical
   system.<br/><br/>The daily operation of interconnected electric power
   systems must guard against failures due to natural disasters, human
   attack, and failures due to aging and unexpected conditions. At the
   heart of this effort is huge data collection, analysis, and control
   strategies spanning time scales from microseconds to minutes and hours.
   Through the creation of new techniques this project will advance our
   understanding of the critical operational issues of the next-generation
   power system and will lead to smarter power grids to provide better
   electric energy security, efficiency, and
   sustainability.<br/><br/>Through this grant we will foster intensive
   training of engineering undergraduate students, developing their
   motivation to pursue graduate studies in this multidisciplinary area.
   The PIs anticipate a direct scientific benefit in training researchers
   who are well-versed in engineering, modeling, and applied mathematics.
   The Co-PI and his group have developed Applets designed for education of
   K-12 students in how power systems operate. An integral part of the
   final outcome of the proposed work will be to provide the community a
   predictive tool that will enhance visual understanding of the effect of
   noise and uncertainty on power system operations.

AB Pervasive business intelligence (BI) is the ability to deliver
   integrated right-time information to all users including managers at all
   levels, front-line and back-office employees, suppliers, customers, and
   business partners. It provides an enterprise with the necessary
   visibility, insight, and facts to make smarter decisions in all
   processes at all times. In most companies, this means leveraging the
   existing BI infrastructure by providing decision services to multiple
   managerial and operational business processes.
   The pervasive BI architecture illustrates both transactional services
   (i.e., Online Transaction Processing, OLTP) and decision-making services
   as peers in the existing infrastructure. Enterprise users may access the
   IT infrastructure via internal and external Web portals, enterprise and
   Web applications, POS terminals, self-service kiosks, hand-held devices,
   and interactive voice response servers.
   Transaction services are applications that provide the enterprise
   bookkeeping function. This is where we find traditional call center
   automation (operational customer relationship management, CRM),
   enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management (SCM), and
   legacy applications.
   Data integration services bridge multiple domains, providing both
   continuous streams of information, as well as batch file data
   acquisition. Acquiring changed data from the transactional repositories;
   the data integration services extract, discover, cleanse, transform, and
   deliver data to multiple subscribers.
   Decision repositories are the enterprise data warehouses, data marts,
   and operational data stores. They ingest and persist the results of data
   integration services and provide high-speed access to a wide variety of
   data content.
   Decision services are used to analyze facts, patterns, and relationships
   in enterprise data repositories and deliver relevant information. This
   part of the architecture focuses on BI and applications accessing the
   data warehouse. This includes reporting, data mining, dashboarding,
   tactical applications, operational applications, and strategic
   applications, such as market segmentation, risk analysis, category
   management, profitability analysis, user satisfaction analysis,
   financial planning, and business performance management.
   Enterprise application integration is largely achieved using an
   Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), messaging middleware, J2EE and .NET
   developer tools, and service-oriented architecture (SOA). Included here
   are numerous middleware services, such as adapters, transforms, agents,
   publish and subscribe, and information routing.
   Business process automation is a collection of capabilities to oversee
   and orchestrate processes. This includes Business Process Management
   (BPM), Business Activity Monitoring (BAM), and Business Rules Engines
   (BRE). These systems manage SOA workflow, detect events, send alerts and
   alarms, and allow business users to dynamically change business rules in
   real time.

AB It's time to visit low latency and reliable real-time (RT)
   infrastructures to support next generation BI applications instead of
   continually debating the need and notion of real-time. The last few
   years have illuminated some key paradigms affecting data management. The
   arguments put forth to move away from traditional DBMS architectures
   have proven persuasive - and specialized architectural data stores are
   being adopted in the industry [1]. The change from traditional database
   pull methods towards intelligent routing/push models is underway,
   causing applications to be redesigned, redeployed, and re-architected.
   One direct result of this is that despite original warnings about
   replication [2] - enterprises continue to deploy multiple replicas to
   support both performance, and high availability of RT applications, with
   an added complexity around manageability of heterogeneous computing
   systems. The enterprise is overflowing with data streams that require
   instantaneous processing and integration, to deliver faster visibility
   and invoke conjoined actions for RT decision making, resulting in
   deployment of advanced BI applications as can be seen by stream
   processing over RT feeds from operational systems for CEP [3]. Given
   these various paradigms, a multitude of new challenges and requirements
   have emerged, thereby necessitating different approaches to management
   of RT applications for BI. The purpose of this paper is to offer a
   viewpoint on how RT affects critical operational applications, evolves
   the weight of non-critical applications, and pressurizes
   availability/data-movement requirements in the underlying
   infrastructure. I will discuss how the Golden Gate TDM platform is being
   deployed within the RTE to manage some of these challenges particularly
   around RT dissemination of transactional data to reduce latency in data
   integration flows, to enable real-time reporting/DW, and to increase
   availability of underlying operational systems. Real world case studies
   will be used to support the various discussion points. The paper is an
   argument to augment traditional DI flows with a real-time technology
   (referred to as transactional data management) to support operational BI
   requirements.

AB Project NarrativeThe proposed research provides a mechanism to
   incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge intodosing guidance for an
   often understudied population - children. An important feature of the
   research isthe incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time
   forecasting of patient response to existingtherapy recommendations
   conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide
   clinicalscenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial
   dashboards developed as part of this proposalcan easily be extended to
   accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded
   toinclude participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical
   pharmacologists, bioinformaticsscientists and pharmacometricians.
