AB This paper presents the Bayesian Adaptive Tactical Decision Support System designed to support operators in Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) operations. The system integrates a situation assessment model that uses a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) for real-time situation prediction and awareness in a probabilistic manner, and a decision-making model that generates adaptive Courses of Action (COAs) based on probabilistic evaluations from the BNN. By leveraging Bayesian methods, the system can handle uncertainty and dynamic environments, providing operators with reliable decision support and actionable recommendations. The proposed approach enhances situational awareness and decision-making in complex, high-risk military operations. Simulation results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in improving mission planning and tactical responses. Future work will focus on scalability, real-world data integration, and further validation in diverse operational contexts.

AB Threat assessment as high level data fusion has received significant attention for military application. Expert systems technique is often applied to threat assessment. Decision making is a reasoning procedure and suitable to threat assessment. According to characteristics of threat assessment and multiple attribute decision making, a method for threat assessment based on multiple attribute decision making is presented in this paper. Fuzzy membership functions and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are used in this method. This method is easy to implement in practice and good at real-time process.

AB In military operations, Commander's Intent describes the desired end state and purpose of the operation, expressed in a concise and clear manner. Command by intent is a paradigm that empowers subordinate units to exercise measured initiative to meet mission goals and accept prudent risk within commander's intent. It improves agility of military operations by allowing exploitation of local opportunities without an explicit directive from the commander to do so. This paper discusses what the paradigm entails in terms of architectural decisions for data fusion systems tasked with real-time information collection to satisfy operational mission goals. In our system, information needs of decisions are expressed at a high level, and shared among relevant nodes. The selected nodes, then, jointly operate to meet mission information needs by forwarding and caching relevant data without explicit directives regarding the objects to fetch and sources to contact. A preliminary evaluation of the system is presented using a target tracking application, set in the context of a NATO-based mission scenario, called Anglova. Evaluation results show that delegating some decision authority to the data fusion system (in terms of objects to fetch and sources to contact) allows it to save more network resources, while also increasing mission success rate. The system is therefore particularly well-suited to operation in partially denied or contested environments, where resource bottlenecks caused by adversarial activity impair one's ability to collect real-time information for mission-critical decision making.

AB A knowledge-based approach and a reasoning system for multisensor data fusion (MSF) is presented. The scenario taken for the example is an air-land battlefield situation. A data fusion system obtains data from a variety of sensors. This is an essential step in a Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence (C3I) system. Automatic processing of sensor data has become essential due to the volume of evidence available in real-time and to support higher level decision making processes. When several varieties of sensors are involved in the process of fusion, each contributing information at its own level of detail, we need to have a way to combine uncertain information from these disparate sensor sources at different levels of abstraction. Dempster-Shafer approach to represent and combine data is found appropriate for this, as this offers a way to combine uncertain information from several sources, each contributing in their own way. Evidential reasoning allows confidences to be assigned to sets of propositions rather than to just N mutually exclusive propositions. The software has been developed in LISP language and tested on the IBM personal computer. The results illustrate the advantages of using multiple sensors in terms of increase in detection probability, increased spatial and temporal coverage and increased reliability that are very important in a battle-field/air-defense/naval-warfare situation.

AB Urban surveillance, of which airborne urban surveillance is a vital constituent, provides situational awareness (SA) and timely response to emergencies. The significance and scope of urban surveillance has increased manyfold in recent years due to the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Internet of things (IoTs), and multitude of sensors. In this article, we propose FogSurv-a fogassisted surveillance architecture and framework leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and information/data fusion for enabling real-time SA and monitoring. We also propose an AI- and data-driven information fusion model for FogSurv to help provide (near) real-time SA, threat assessment, and automated decision-making. We further present a latency model for AI and information fusion processing in FogSurv. We then discuss several use cases of FogSurv that can have a huge impact on multifarious fronts of national significance ranging from safeguarding national security to monitoring of critical infrastructures. We conduct an extensive set of experiments to demonstrate that FogSurv using AI and data fusion help provide near real-time inferences and SA. Experimental results demonstrate that FogSurv provides a latency improvement of 37% on average over cloud architectures for the selected benchmarks. Results further indicate that combining AI with data fusion as in FogSurv can provide a speedup of up to 9.8x over AI without data fusion while also maintaining or improving the inference accuracy. Additionally, results show that AI combined with fusion of different image modalities obtained through UAVs in FogSurv results in improved average precision of target detection for surveillance as compared to AI without data fusion for different target scales and environment complexity.

AB Multi-sensor data fusion techniques combine data from multiple sensors in order to get more accurate and efficient meaningful information through several intelligent process levels that may not be possible from a single sensor alone. One of the most important parts in the intelligent data fusion system is the identification fusion, and it can be categorized into physical models, parametric classification and cognitive-based models. In this paper, we present a novel identification fusion method by integrating two fusion approaches such as the parametric classification techniques and the cognitive-based models for achieving high intelligent decision support. We also have confirmed that the reliability and performance of two-phase identification algorithm never fall behind other fusion methods. We thus argue that our heuristics are required for effective decision making in real time for intelligent military situation assessment.

AB The effective Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems are crucial for modern military operations providing clear situational awareness and vital elements for decision-making. Various AI techniques have been already applied to enhance data integration and some other C4ISR components.
   This article proposes to explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the current C4ISR capacities such as analyzing vast amounts of data, translating languages, and generating diverse creative text formats that make them useful for heterogeneous data and information fusion, threats and fakes detection and analysis and decision support. After the introduction, the literature review discusses the technical considerations and potential benefits from the integration of LLMs into C4ISR systems. This discussion includes the functionalities such as multisource and multimodal data integration, detection, analysis and prediction of threats and misinformation, decision support through analysis of complex scenarios, identifying potential courses of action, and providing real-time recommendations to commanders working in evolving situations.
   The main challenges related to the use of today's LLMs to enhance C4ISR framework such as data security, model interpretability, and bias mitigation will be studied during this research. The specific challenges will be derived from the main case study. This article includes also some characteristics that may serve to elaborate the best-suited framework. This article ends by perspective for future work.

AB Mobile vehicle identification has a wide application field for both civilian and military uses. Vehicle identification may be achieved by incorporating single or multiple sensor solutions and through data fusion. This paper considers a single-sensor multistage hierarchical algorithm of acoustic signal analysis and pattern recognition for the identification of mobile vehicles in an open environment. The algorithm applies several standalone techniques to enable complex decision-making during event identification. Computationally inexpensive procedures are specifically chosen in order to provide real-time operation capability. The algorithm is tested on pre-recorded audio signals of civilian vehicles passing the measurement point and shows promising classification accuracy. Implementation on a specific embedded device is also presented and the capability of real-time operation on this device is demonstrated.

AB The management of war casualties has evolved significantly. Tactical tourniquets, early surgical haemostasis and massive transfusion protocols have all contributed to a significant decrease in war casualties' mortality. Large scale combat scenarios pose new and major challenges, as the volume of casualties is predicted to exceed available resources. Combat Medical Early Warning Systems (CMEWS) and wearable biosensors could present promising solutions in this context. An Early Warning System consists of three key components: data collection of vital signs, analysis through an Early Warning Score and a corresponding medical response. Biosensors, on the other hand, enable continuous monitoring of physiological parameters. Their miniaturisation, connectivity and reliability make them promising tools, though challenges such as accuracy, cost and data integration remain. Integrated CMEWS, combining biosensors with automated decision-making algorithms, could revolutionise the management of war casualties. These systems would assist in the early identification of severe war casualties and triage, assisting health services in casualty flow management. They have the potential for providing a shared, real-time overview of casualties' status for all healthcare providers. Additionally, the integration of these systems into the battlefield would facilitate improved coordination across medical and command structures, enhancing patient management even in remote or high-risk environments. However, the adoption of integrated CMEWS and biosensors faces challenges, including data security concerns, infrastructure limitations and the need for significant investment and training. Despite these hurdles, their potential to enhance casualty care, particularly in high-intensity conflict settings, is evident and could transform both military and civilian emergency medical care.

DE PLANNER; VTIME; Installation Resilience; Data Mapping; Risk Analysis
AB Data has become increasingly crucial for decision-making and analysis across the United States (US) government in a complex world with evolving risks. The volume, velocity, and variety of data collected by installations require more effort to understand and synthesize the various types of data. For military installations to modernize and mitigate current and future threats, they need to revolutionize installation master planning. Installation master planning is the process of planning to develop land, facilities, and infrastructure while ensuring sustainability, efficient use of resources, and risk management. PLANNER is designed to digitize and operationalize integrated installation planning, automating data collection and organization to reduce the workforce required by master planners, environmental planners, and energy managers by accessing multiple data sources through the data lake provided by the Virtual Toolbox for Installation Mission Effectiveness (VTIME). It applies a comprehensive systems approach to identify and acquire the relevant data sources required for risk and resilience analysis, provides a single place to access and analyze the data, and provides decision support in near real-time.

AB Modern industrial energy systems are increasingly reliant on heterogeneous data streams from sensors, grid infrastructure, renewable forecasts, and cybersecurity telemetry. Effectively fusing these diverse sources is essential for achieving resilient, efficient, and sustainable operations. In this paper, we present a Fusion-based Unified Security and Energy efficiency approach for Industrial Systems (FUSE-IS), a novel multi-modal data fusion framework. FUSE-IS integrates deep learning-based threat detection, differential privacy mechanisms, and carbon-aware resource scheduling. It enhances security, privacy, and energy efficiency in industrial energy environments. Unlike traditional solutions that address these objectives in isolation, FUSE-IS employs a unified data fusion approach that combines these solutions. As a result, it enabled real-time adaptive decision-making for threat mitigation, data protection, and carbon-optimized computing. Experimental results demonstrate that FUSE-IS achieves 98.5 % detection accuracy with only 1.2% false positives, while reducing energy consumption by 24% and carbon emissions by 20% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains strong privacy guarantees (epsilon = 0.9) with minimal accuracy degradation (0.7 %). A case study on DDoS mitigation illustrates FUSE-IS's ability to dynamically adjust defense strategies based on carbon intensity fluctuations, resulting in a 27 % emission reduction during the attack window.

AB Wearable biosensors represent an advanced solution for physiological and metabolic monitoring under extreme operational conditions. This review aimed to comparatively analyze the functionality, technological characteristics, and applicability of wearable biosensors used for nutritional and physiological monitoring in military and high-performance contexts. A total of 26 scientific articles (2015-2025) indexed in the Web of Science - Core Collection were included based on defined eligibility criteria. Data extraction focused on monitored parameters, transduction technologies, biosensor type, application context, and study design. Each device was assessed using a functional scoring system evaluating portability, accuracy, and operational utility. The results revealed high average scores for portability and field applicability, especially among electrophysiological and optical biosensors. However, most devices focused on cardiovascular, respiratory, and thermoregulatory monitoring, with limited integration of nutrition-specific biomarkers such as glucose, lactate, or salivary analytes. Only a few systems provided truly multimodal tracking. These findings emphasize a significant technological gap in the integration of comprehensive metabolic monitoring within wearable platforms. The analysis also highlights critical innovation priorities: development of autonomous, multisensory biosensors; enhanced energy autonomy; and increased data fusion capacity. In conclusion, wearable biosensors offer promising tools for strengthening physiological resilience, supporting preventive strategies, and improving real-time decision-making in military theaters. However, further innovation is needed to achieve robust, field-ready systems capable of holistic physiological and nutritional surveillance.

AB Cognitive radio (CR), which enables opportunistic access to underutilized licensed bands, has been presented as a tempting technology for the optimization of spectrum utilization in recent years. To solve the hidden terminal problem, collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS), which benifits from spatial diversity, has been studied intensively in CR networks. For current CSS schemes, secondary users (SUs) are generally assumed to send sensing information honestly, however, misbehaved SUs may report false sensing data to mislead and compromise the system, which is called spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. In order to defense against malicious SSDF attacks, certain evidence-theory-based secure sensing approaches have been proposed. However, in most of the current evidence-theory-based CSS schemes, only real-time evidence information is utilized to estimate the sensing reliability of cognitive users, like the difference in SNR or similarity degree. Inadequate consideration causes CSS system being vulnerable to SSDF attacks, and the correctness of global decision making cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a credible CSS scheme based on evidence theory. It evaluates the credibility of each SU with two indexes, which are the statistical reputation factor and the real-time reliability factor, respectively. In addition, considering the transmitted data rises with the number of SUs increasing, we propose a rational mass distribution (RMD) approach to adjust evidence theory to binary hypothesis test in spectrum sensing context. As a consequence, both the data volume to be transmitted and the workload at data fusion center has been reduced. Simulation results have proved that the proposed scheme is effective and robust to defense against distinctive SSDF attack patterns.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have revolutionized transportation by incorporating advanced technologies for efficient and safe mobility. However, these systems face challenges ensuring security and resilience against adversarial attacks. This research addresses these challenges and introduces a novel Dampster-Shafer data fusion-based Adversarial Deep Learning (DS-ADL) Model for ITS in fog cloud environments. Our proposed model focuses on three levels of adversarial attacks: original image level, feature level, and decision level. Adversarial examples are generated at each level to evaluate the system's vulnerability comprehensively. To enhance the system's capabilities, we leverage the power of several vital components. Firstly, we employ Dempster-Shafer-based Multimodal Sensor Fusion, enabling the fusion of information from multiple sensors for improved scene understanding. This fusion approach enhances the system's perception and decision-making abilities. For feature extraction and classification, we utilize ResNet 101, a deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in computer vision tasks. We introduced a novel Monomodal Multidimensional Gaussian Model (MMGM-DD) based Adversarial Detection approach to detect adversarial examples. This detection mechanism enhances the system's ability to identify and mitigate adversarial attacks in real-time. Additionally, we incorporate the Defensive Distillation method for adversarial training, which trains the model to be robust against attacks by exposing it to adversarial examples during the training process. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we utilize two datasets: Google Speech Command version 0.01 and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). Evaluation metrics include latency delay and computation time (fog-cloud), accuracy, MSE, loss, and F-score for attack detection and defense. The results and discussions demonstrate the effectiveness of our Dampster-Shafer data fusion-based Adversarial Deep Learning Model in enhancing the robustness and security of ITS in fog-cloud environments. The model's ability to detect and defend against adversarial attacks while maintaining low-latency fog-cloud operations highlights its potential for real-world deployment in ITS.

AB This paper presents a real-time adaptive trajectory prediction framework for cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms engaged in dynamic target tracking within cluttered environments. The proposed system introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based control architecture combining fuzzy inference, neuroemotional learning, and distributed multi-agent coordination. At the core of the approach is a Bidirectional Fuzzy Brain Emotional Learning Prediction (BFBEL-P) model, which integrates fuzzy logic and an online adaptive neural structure to enable trajectory forecasting without pre-training or prior knowledge of the environment. From an engineering perspective, this AI model is deployed in UAV swarm navigation, where robust decision-making, predictive coordination, and obstacle avoidance are essential for target interception missions. In contrast to conventional prediction methods, such as curve fitting, nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), and deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the BFBEL-P framework offers fast convergence, low computational cost, and high adaptability. The system incorporates multi-threaded data fusion across the swarm to achieve consensus-driven predictions and maintain situational awareness, even under sensor failures or occlusions. Simulation results show that BFBEL-P improves short-term prediction accuracy by 82.2%, reduces prediction time by 15%, and achieves a 100% tracking success rate across benchmark scenarios. These results establish BFBEL-P as a reliable AI technique for distributed control in real-world UAV swarm applications, offering a promising tool for search-and-rescue, surveillance, and defense operations.

AB Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for solving stochastic optimization problems. The aerospace and defense sectors have a number of stochastic optimization problems that would benefit from the application of ML; however, people often have difficulties interpreting solutions arrived at via ML, which undermines trust, producing an obstacle to widespread adoption in these sectors. This paper introduces the Self-Explaining Decision Architecture (SEDA) for ML-based decision-making systems capable of generating intuitive explanations for their decisions in real time. SEDA makes use of a feature extraction subsystem and a sequence interpretation subsystem to identify patterns in data followed by a decision generation subsystem that determines appropriate actions based on those patterns. Internal state information from each of these subsystems is used to generate explanations of the system's decisions. Using this information to create explanations provides insight as to the data elements the system focused on when making decisions as well as the reasoning that was used. As a proof-of-concept, we present a first implementation of SEDA using start-of-the-art deep learning components including a combined convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network with attention mechanisms and demonstrate its use on both standard and custom datasets.

AB Objective Space-based information support is a core component of modern operational systems. It acquires, transmits, and processes information through space-based platforms to provide full-process, round-the-clock information support for remote precision strikes. Therefore, digital simulation and verification of space-based information support systems have become key means for combat concept design, scheme demonstration, and rapid capability iteration. This study examines the application of Model-Based Systems Engineering(MBSE) to integrated simulation of space-based support operations. The objective is to address key challenges in information representation, system interoperability, and integrated simulation in complex combat systems. To overcome the limitations of traditional simulation approaches in cross-platform collaboration, dynamic extensibility, and efficient integration of functional logic with spatiotemporal information, a multi-perspective modeling and simulation method based on the Discrete EVent System specification(DEVS) is proposed. A hybrid integrated simulation framework is constructed. Methods The proposed framework enables abstract interconnection of weapon and equipment models, plug-and-play integration of simulation resources, precise global time synchronization, and high-performance realtime communication. These capabilities are achieved through four core modules: data integration management, heterogeneous software adapters, time management control, and publish-subscribe mechanisms. The framework supports interoperability and reusability of heterogeneous simulation software. On this basis, a joint simulation system is designed by integrating system architecture development and verification software with spatiotemporal simulation software for visualization and reasoning. Message middleware supports bidirectional synchronous interaction between state machines and spatiotemporal models, enabling closed-loop verification from combat concepts to digital inference. The core contribution of this research is the removal of long-standing separation between discrete event logic describing combat functions, information flow, and state machines, typically modeled using Systems Modeling Language (SysML), and continuous physical scenes, such as spatiotemporal motion and sensor coverage, constructed on visualization and deduction platforms. Through real-time bidirectional data exchange enabled by message middleware, discrete command decisions drive continuous platform behavior, whereas dynamic changes in battlefield conditions trigger corresponding combat responses. Results and Discussions A complete closed-loop simulation of a "maritime island and reef reconnaissance support denial operation" scenario is conducted using the joint simulation system, producing effective verification results. The simulation reproduces the full process from space-based target detection to coordinated regional denial by multi-domain forces. First, a capability-activity-equipment analysis model for the combat mission is developed using the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF), generating equipment interaction relationships and corresponding state machines. In parallel, continuous construction of the combat scenario is implemented on the visualization and deduction platform. The entire deduction process is precisely synchronized with physical motion through the state machine model deployed in the system architecture development and verification platform.
   Each state transition, such as "target detection," "strike initiation," and "effect evaluation," triggers corresponding spatiotemporal simulation activities. Platform states and environmental data fed back from the visualization and deduction platform then drive subsequent state machine evolution. Through joint simulation, the rationality and feasibility of the operational concept, in which multi-domain unmanned forces conduct reconnaissance, deterrence, and denial under space-based information support, are verified. The results provide an intuitive and high-confidence basis for decision-making in system scheme optimization. Conclusions This study investigates the application of model-driven technology to the design and validation of space-based support joint operation systems. A joint simulation framework enabling deep integration of functional logic and physical scenarios is constructed and validated. Unlike conventional simulation approaches that focus on static structures or isolated functions, the proposed framework couples SysML-based discrete event logic models with continuous spatiotemporal dynamic models through a distributed architecture consisting of one core platform and multiple component adapters. This approach resolves the long-standing separation between functional modeling and scene simulation. Discrete behaviors, such as command decision-making and state transitions, directly drive platform movement and interaction within realistic spatiotemporal environments. Conversely, dynamic battlefield changes provide real-time feedback that affects higher-level logical decisions, forming a bidirectional closed loop. The framework integrates the precision of functional logic with the intuitiveness of scene simulation and enables realistic reproduction of multi-domain collaborative operations in digital space. It provides effective support for system design, operational deduction, and high-confidence verification of space-based support joint operation systems.

AB Significance The threat of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) impacts is inherently linked to humanity's future, rendering the establishment of a global defense system an urgent priority. The successful implementation of NASA's double asteroid redirection test (DART) mission and ESA's Hera mission have verified the feasibility of active NEA defense technologies. In these missions, on-board space optical payloads played an irreplaceable role in critical processes including target detection, navigation control, and impact effect assessment. For China's proposed first NEA defense mission, developing an independently controllable space optical payload system is not only essential for verifying the country's own defense capabilities but also contributes to the global NEA defense network. Given the characteristics of target asteroids, China's space-and ground-based deep-space monitoring resources, and platform capabilities, clarifying the requirements, technical features, and application outcomes of space optical payloads is of great significance for laying the foundation of China's NEA defense system.<br /> Progress This study systematically reviews the technical characteristics and application outcomes of space optical payloads in NEA defense missions (e. g., DART and Hera) and analyzes the payload configuration requirements for China's first NEA defense mission (Table 1 and Table 2). For NASA's DART mission, the space optical payload inherits mature technologies from deep-space exploration and is optimized for defense-specific needs. The DART mission's Didymos reconnaissance and asteroid camera for OpNav (DRACO) serves as a representative example: featuring a 208 mm aperture, 2.48 mu rad angular resolution, and 14.5-magnitude detection capability, DRACO builds on the design of LORRI cameras from NASA's New Horizons and Lucy missions while introducing key improvements-including the replacement of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors, adoption of global/ rolling shutter dual-mode operation, integration of the SMART Nav autonomous navigation algorithm, and improved adaptability to low-temperature environments [(-85 +/- 5) degrees C] (Fig. 1). These upgrades enable DRACO to achieve cm-level impact point positioning (1 sigma error: +/- 68 cm) for the 160 m asteroid Dimorphos and capture high-resolution data on the size and distribution of boulders on its surface. For ESA's subsequent Hera mission, payloads-including the asteroid framing camera (AFC), thermal infrared imager (TIRI), HyperScout H imaging spectrometer, and ASPECT hyperspectral imager-further enhance the mission's multi-dimensional detection capabilities. Additionally, LICIACube (a NASA auxiliary CubeSat for the DART mission) carries LEIA (wide-field) and LUKE (narrow-field) cameras, which captures images of Dimorphos' unimpacted hemisphere and dynamic videos of ejecta evolution processes, verifying the "primary mission+CubeSat" payload collaboration mode. Three core technical challenges in space optical payload design are addressed during NASA's DART mission. 1) Navigation-imaging multiplexing technology: DRACO employs rolling shutter mode (4.9 mu rad angular resolution, 30x gain) for long-range navigation (resolving low signal-to-noise ratio problems) and global exposure mode (2.48 mu rad angular resolution, 1x gain) for short-range high-precision detection (mitigating read noise and popcorn effects).
   Algorithm-based compensation was also implemented to correct rolling shutter distortion (up to 5 pixels) induced by rapid spacecraft attitude drift. 2) Autonomous high-precision guidance, navigation, and control: the SMART Nav algorithm assumes control of the spacecraft's trajectory 4 h before impact, extracted Dimorphos' centroid via surface feature detection, calculates real-time 3D coordinates of the impact point, and reduces the orbital error to the 10 m range 10 min prior to impact. In the final 30 s (when ground intervention was impossible due to signal delay), the algorithm completes image processing and decision-making within 200 ms. 3) Space environment adaptability: DRACO adopts a Ritchey-Chr & eacute;tien optical system equipped with a lightweight microcrystalline glass primary mirror and Invar support (characterized by a low thermal expansion coefficient). It also eliminated the focusing mechanism to reduce weight and adopted a commercial CMOS detector integrated with overcurrent detection to mitigate single-event functional interruptions (SEFI), while exploring a low-cost technical approach. For China's first NEA defense mission, the target asteroid has a diameter of approximately 30 meters, with an unknown rotation period and surface properties. The mission requires its payloads to satisfy both engineering objectives (high-speed precision guidance and impact effect assessment) and scientific goals (research on orbital and intrinsic properties). Proposed payloads include: 1) a high-resolution camera (0.1 m resolution at 30 km, supporting both video and photography modes) for measuring asteroid shape and monitoring ejecta; 2) a multispectral camera (spectral range: 480-1000 nm, >= 8 bands) for surface topography and material research; 3) a visible-infrared spectrometer (spectral range: 400-1000 nm, >= 256 bands) for high-resolution spectral data acquisition; 4) a thermal radiation spectrometer (spectral range: 5-50 mu m, temperature measurement accuracy: +/- 2 K) to invert thermophysical drivers of orbital evolution (e.g., the Yarkovsky effect) through multi-source data fusion. These payloads leverage China's mature deep-space exploration technologies but require optimization to accommodate the smaller target asteroid and higher impact velocity.<br /> Conclusions and Prospects For China's NEA defense mission, the unique "flyby+impact+flyby" mode demands that payloads focus on dynamic monitoring, multi-dimensional comparison, and long-term stability. To achieve this, three key directions should be prioritized. 1) Strengthen scientific team-building, optimize parameters, and build a data platform for resource sharing. 2) Promote multi-payload collaboration and autonomy. 3) Optimize payload configuration and improve precision to compensate for limited ground-based observation data.By advancing these directions, China can build a space optical payload system with independent characteristics, providing technical support for its NEA defense mission and contributing a Chinese solution to global NEA defense.

DE Bathymetry; Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV); Echo-Sounder and Open Source
AB In recent years, the use of unmanned vehicles has advanced because of a growing number of civil applications such as firefighting or non-military security work, such as surveillance of pipelines etc. The application of these technologies with decreased cost and size has received attention in both civil and military applications. Recent advances in sensors, modeling and simulation and availability of open-source software and hardware for data integration has created an environment of remotely monitoring that was not possible a few years ago. This paper examines a niche cost-effective, portable Unmanned Surface Vessel that has been designed to capture the bathymetric profile of shallow water basins using single beam echosounder. Bathymetry is the measurement of the depth of water in oceans, rivers, or lakes. Bathymetric maps look a lot like topographic maps, which use lines to show the shape and elevation of land features. Today, echo sounders are used to make bathymetric measurements. Global shallow water bathymetry maps offer critical information to inform activities such as scientific research, environment protection, and marine transportation. Accurate mapping of shallow bathymetry is critical for understanding and characterizing coastal environments providing a foundation for measuring underwater light density, mapping and monitoring and planning marine operations and transportation. Methods for estimating shallow water bathymetry have suffered from a variety of trade-offs and limitations. Conventional methods such as shipborne sounding or airborne LiDAR have limited spatial coverage. The unit described in this paper has been designed and has been trained to acquire data in a predefined set path, minimizing the human intervention and the associated errors. A successful trial run was done for mapping the bed profile of the river basin in India. The vessel has been upskilled for capturing sonar data sets, with water quality parameters and soil samples using an automated auger. The vessel functions using the combined various open-source software and hardware tools for data assimilation, while the captured data sets are real- time transferred using IOT to Ground Controlled Station. The tropical river basin chosen is a part of Netravati River located in Dakshina Kannada District, Karnataka, India. This area is a part of the monsoon belt, and the Netravati riverbed is subjected to heavy sand deposition during a part of the year. The data on the excessive sand deposition is of immense value to the district and state administration. This study has been carried out at a frequency of 30 days and is provided as an input during non- monsoon period for district administration for outlining removal of excessive sand deposition monitoring of water quality in the estuarine ecosystem. The work done is a one-of-a-kind pilot study developed in-house using the recent advances seen in the world of open-source platforms. This paper demonstrates a unique application that is of value to the state administration in decision making and in addition contributes to environmental monitoring of the riverbed
