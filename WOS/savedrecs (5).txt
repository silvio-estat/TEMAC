AB As architecture, systems, and data management communities pay greater
   attention to innovative big data systems and architecture, the pressure
   of benchmarking and evaluating these systems rises. However, the
   complexity, diversity, frequently changed workloads, and rapid evolution
   of big data systems raise great challenges in big data benchmarking.
   Considering the broad use of big data systems, for the sake of fairness,
   big data benchmarks must include diversity of data and workloads, which
   is the prerequisite for evaluating big data systems and architecture.
   Most of the state-of-the-art big data benchmarking efforts target
   evaluating specific types of applications or system software stacks, and
   hence they are not qualified for serving the purposes mentioned above.
   This paper presents our joint research efforts on this issue with
   several industrial partners. Our big data benchmark suite-BigDataBench
   not only covers broad application scenarios, but also includes diverse
   and representative data sets. Currently, we choose 19 big data
   benchmarks from dimensions of application scenarios, operations/
   algorithms, data types, data sources, software stacks, and application
   types, and they are comprehensive for fairly measuring and evaluating
   big data systems and architecture. Big-DataBench is publicly available
   from the project home page http://prof.ict.ac.cn/BigDataBench.
   Also, we comprehensively characterize 19 big data workloads included in
   BigDataBench with varying data inputs. On a typical state-of-practice
   processor, Intel Xeon E5645, we have the following observations: First,
   in comparison with the traditional benchmarks: including PARSEC. HPCC,
   and SPECCPU, big data applications have very low operation intensity,
   which measures the ratio of the total number of instructions divided by
   the total byte number of memory accesses; Second, the volume of data
   input has non-negligible impact on micro-architecture characteristics,
   which may impose challenges for simulation-based big data architecture
   research; Last but not least, corroborating the observations in
   CloudSuite and DCBench (which use smaller data inputs), we find that the
   numbers of Li instruction cache (LII) misses per 1000 instructions (in
   short, MPKI) of the big data applications are higher than in the
   traditional benchmarks; also, we find that L3 caches are effective for
   the big data applications, corroborating the observation in DCBench.

AB Model-based analysis tools, built on assumptions and simplifications,
   are difficult to handle smart grids with data characterized by volume,
   velocity, variety, and veracity (i.e., 4Vs data). This paper, using
   random matrix theory (RMT), motivates data-driven tools to perceive the
   complex grids in high-dimension; meanwhile, an architecture with
   detailed procedures is proposed. In algorithm perspective, the
   architecture performs a high-dimensional analysis and compares the
   findings with RMT predictions to conduct anomaly detections. Mean
   spectral radius (MSR), as a statistical indicator, is defined to reflect
   the correlations of system data in different dimensions. In management
   mode perspective, a group-work mode is discussed for smart grids
   operation. This mode breaks through regional limitations for energy
   flows and data flows, and makes advanced big data analyses possible. For
   a specific large-scale zone-dividing system with multiple connected
   utilities, each site, operating under the group-work mode, is able to
   work out the regional MSR only with its own measured/simulated data. The
   large-scale interconnected system, in this way, is naturally decoupled
   from statistical parameters perspective, rather than from engineering
   models perspective. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of these
   distributed MSRs, even with imperceptible different raw data, will
   produce a contour line to detect the event and locate the source. It
   demonstrates that the architecture is compatible with the block
   calculation only using the regional small database; beyond that, this
   architecture, as a data-driven solution, is sensitive to system
   situation awareness, and practical for real large-scale interconnected
   systems. Five case studies and their visualizations validate the
   designed architecture in various fields of power systems. To our best
   knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to apply big data technology
   into smart grids.

AB Both big data and software-defined networking (SDN) have attracted great
   interests from both academia and industry. These two important areas
   have traditionally been addressed separately in the most of previous
   works. However, on the one hand, the good features of SDN can greatly
   facilitate big data acquisition, transmission, storage, and processing.
   On the other hand, big data will have profound impacts on the design and
   operation of SDN. In this paper, we present the good features of SDN in
   solving several issues prevailing with big data applications, including
   big data processing in cloud data centers, data delivery, joint
   optimization, scientific big data architectures and scheduling issues.
   We show that SDN can manage the network efficiently for improving the
   performance of big data applications. In addition, we show that big data
   can benefit SDN as well, including traffic engineering, cross-layer
   design, defeating security attacks, and SDN-based intra and inter data
   center networks. Moreover, we discuss a number of open issues that need
   to be addressed to jointly consider big data and SDN in future research.

AB Big Data are becoming a new technology focus both in science and in
   industry and motivate technology shift to data centric architecture and
   operational models. There is a vital need to define the basic
   information/semantic models, architecture components and operational
   models that together comprise a so-called Big Data Ecosystem. This paper
   discusses a nature of Big Data that may originate from different
   scientific, industry and social activity domains and proposes improved
   Big Data definition that includes the following parts: Big Data
   properties (also called Big Data 5V: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value
   and Veracity), data models and structures, data analytics,
   infrastructure and security. The paper discusses paradigm change from
   traditional host or service based to data centric architecture and
   operational models in Big Data. The Big Data Architecture Framework
   (BDAF) is proposed to address all aspects of the Big Data Ecosystem and
   includes the following components: Big Data Infrastructure, Big Data
   Analytics, Data structures and models, Big Data Lifecycle Management,
   Big Data Security. The paper analyses requirements to and provides
   suggestions how the mentioned above components can address the main Big
   Data challenges. The presented work intends to provide a consolidated
   view of the Big Data phenomena and related challenges to modern
   technologies, and initiate wide discussion.

AB Blockchain appears to still be nascent in its growth and a relatively
   untapped asset. This research investigates the need of blockchain in
   Industry 4.0 environment from Big Data perspective in supply chain
   management. The research method used in this study involves a
   combination of an Action Research method and Case Study research. More
   specifically, the action research method was applied in two industry
   case studies that implemented and tested the designed architecture in a
   global logistics environment. Case Study A examined the blockchain
   application in cross-border cargo movements whereas Case Study B
   investigated the application in a liquid chemical logistics company
   serving to petroleum industries. Our research analysis has identified
   that the Case A subject had disconnected systems and services for
   blockchain wherein the big data interactions had failed (failure case).
   Whereas in Case B, the company has achieved nearly 25% increase in
   revenue through its customer service after the blockchain implementation
   and thereby reduction in paperwork and carbon emissions (success case).
   This research contributes to the advancement of the body of knowledge to
   big data and blockchain by identifying key implementation guideline and
   issues for blockchain in supply chain management. Further, action-based
   research coupled with a case study approach has been used to evaluate
   the application aspects of the architecture's scalability and
   functionality of bigdata and blockchain in supply chain management.

AB As the challenge of our time, Big Data still has many research hassles,
   especially the variety of data. The high diversity of data sources often
   results in information silos, a collection of non-integrated data
   management systems with heterogeneous schemas, query languages, and
   APIs. Data Lake systems have been proposed as a solution to this
   problem, by providing a schema-less repository for raw data with a
   common access interface. However, just dumping all data into a data lake
   without any metadata management, would only lead to a 'data swamp'. To
   avoid this, we propose Constance', a Data Lake system with sophisticated
   metadata management over raw data extracted from heterogeneous data
   sources. Constance discovers, extracts, and summarizes the structural
   metadata from the data sources, and annotates data and metadata with
   semantic information to avoid ambiguities. With embedded query rewriting
   engines supporting structured data and semi-structured data, Constance
   provides users a unified interface for query processing and data
   exploration. During the demo, we will walk through each functional
   component of Constance. Constance will be applied to two real-life use
   cases in order to show attendees the importance and usefulness of our
   generic and extensible data lake system.

AB People, devices, infrastructures and sensors can constantly communicate
   exchanging data and generating new data that trace many of these
   exchanges. This leads to vast volumes of data collected at ever
   increasing velocities and of different variety, a phenomenon currently
   known as Big Data. In particular, recent developments in Information and
   Communications Technologies are pushing the fourth industrial
   revolution, Industry 4.0, being data generated by several sources like
   machine controllers, sensors, manufacturing systems, among others.
   Joining volume, variety and velocity of data, with Industry 4.0, makes
   the opportunity to enhance sustainable innovation in the Factories of
   the Future. In this, the collection, integration, storage, processing
   and analysis of data is a key challenge, being Big Data systems needed
   to link all the entities and data needs of the factory. Thereby, this
   paper addresses this key challenge, proposing and implementing a Big
   Data Analytics architecture, using a multinational organisation (Bosch
   Car Multimedia - Braga) as a case study. In this work, all the data
   lifecycle, from collection to analysis, is handled, taking into
   consideration the different data processing speeds that can exist in the
   real environment of a factory (batch or stream).

AB Artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, cloud computing,
   and Internet of Things (IoT) are terms which have driven the fourth
   industrial revolution. The digital revolution has transformed the
   manufacturing industry into smart manufacturing through the development
   of intelligent systems. In this paper, a big data ecosystem is presented
   for the implementation of fault detection and diagnosis in predictive
   maintenance with real industrial big data gathered directly from
   large-scale global manufacturing plants, aiming to provide a complete
   architecture which could be used in industrial IoT-based smart
   manufacturing in an industrial 4.0 system. The proposed architecture
   overcomes multiple challenges including big data ingestion, integration,
   transformation, storage, analytics, and visualization in a real-time
   environment using various technologies such as the data lake, NoSQL
   database, Apache Spark, Apache Drill, Apache Hive, OPC Collector, and
   other techniques. Transformation protocols, authentication, and data
   encryption methods are also utilized to address data and network
   security issues. A MapReduce-based distributed PCA model is designed for
   fault detection and diagnosis. In a large-scale manufacturing system,
   not all kinds of failure data are accessible, and the absence of labels
   precludes all the supervised methods in the predictive phase.
   Furthermore, the proposed framework takes advantage of some of the
   characteristics of PCA such as its ease of implementation on Spark, its
   simple algorithmic structure, and its real-time processing ability. All
   these elements are essential for smart manufacturing in the evolution to
   Industry 4.0. The proposed detection system has been implemented into
   the real-time industrial production system in a cooperated company,
   running for several years, and the results successfully provide an alarm
   warning several days before the fault happens. A test case involving
   several outages in 2014 is reported and analyzed in detail during the
   experiment section.

AB This study aims to investigate the contributions of online promotional
   marketing and online reviews as predictors of consumer product demands.
   Using electronic data from Amazon. com, we attempt to predict if online
   review variables such as valence and volume of reviews, the number of
   positive and negative reviews, and online promotional marketing
   variables such as discounts and free deliveries, can influence the
   demand of electronic products in Amazon. com. A Big Data architecture
   was developed and Node. JS agents were deployed for scraping the Amazon.
   com pages using asynchronous Input/Output calls. The completed Web
   crawling and scraping data-sets were then preprocessed for Neural
   Network analysis. Our results showed that variables from both online
   reviews and promotional marketing strategies are important predictors of
   product demands. Variables in online reviews in general were better
   predictors as compared to online marketing promotional variables. This
   study provides important implications for practitioners as they can
   better understand how online reviews and online promotional marketing
   can influence product demands. Our empirical contributions include the
   design of a Big Data architecture that incorporate Neural Network
   analysis which can used as a platform for future researchers to
   investigate how Big Data can be used to understand and predict online
   consumer product demands.

   lake was introduced to address them. A data lake is a large, raw data
   repository that stores and manages all company data bearing any format.
   However, the data lake concept remains ambiguous or fuzzy for many
   researchers and practitioners, who often confuse it with the Hadoop
   technology. Thus, we provide in this paper a comprehensive state of the
   art of the different approaches to data lake design. We particularly
   focus on data lake architectures and metadata management, which are key
   issues in successful data lakes. We also discuss the pros and cons of
   data lakes and their design alternatives.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate if online reviews
   (e.g. valence and volume), online promotional strategies (e.g. free
   delivery and discounts) and sentiments from user reviews can help
   predict product sales.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors designed a big data
   architecture and deployed Node. js agents for scraping the Amazon.com
   pages using asynchronous input/output calls. The completed web crawling
   and scraping data sets were then preprocessed for sentimental and neural
   network analysis. The neural network was employed to examine which
   variables in the study are important predictors of product sales.
   Findings - This study found that although online reviews, online
   promotional strategies and online sentiments can all predict product
   sales, some variables are more important predictors than others. The
   authors found that the interplay effects of these variables become more
   important variables than the individual variables themselves. For
   example, online volume interactions with sentiments and discounts are
   more important than the individual predictors of discounts, sentiments
   or online volume.
   Originality/value - This study designed big data architecture, in
   combination with sentimental and neural network analysis that can
   facilitate future business research for predicting product sales in an
   online environment. This study also employed a predictive analytic
   approach (e.g. neural network) to examine the variables, and this
   approach is useful for future data analysis in a big data environment
   where prediction can have more practical implications than significance
   testing. This study also examined the interplay between online reviews,
   sentiments and promotional strategies, which up to now have mostly been
   examined individually in previous studies.

AB In recent times, construction industry is enduring pressure to take
   drastic steps to minimise waste. Waste intelligence advocates
   retrospective measures to manage waste after it is produced. Existing
   waste intelligence based waste management software are fundamentally
   limited and cannot facilitate stakeholders in controlling wasteful
   activities. Paradoxically, despite a great amount of effort, the waste
   being produced by the construction industry is escalating. This
   undesirable situation motivates a radical change from waste intelligence
   to waste analytics (in which waste is propose to be tackle proactively
   right at design through sophisticated big data technologies). This paper
   highlight that waste minimisation at design (a.k.a. designing-out waste)
   is data-driven and computationally intensive challenge.
   The aim of this paper is to propose a Big Data architecture for
   construction waste analytics. To this end, existing literature on big
   data technologies is reviewed to identify the critical components of the
   proposed Big Data based waste analytics architecture. At the crux,
   graph-based components are used: in particular, a graph database (Neo41)
   is adopted to store highly voluminous and diverse datasets. To
   complement, Spark, a highly resilient graph processing system, is
   employed. Provision for extensions through Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) are also considered for synergy and greater adoption.
   This symbiotic integration of technologies enables a vibrant environment
   for design exploration and optimisation to tackle construction waste.
   The main contribution of this paper is that it presents, to the best of
   our knowledge, the first Big Data based architecture for construction
   waste analytics. The architecture is validated for exploratory analytics
   of 200,000 waste disposal records from 900 completed projects. It is
   revealed that existing waste management software classify the bulk of
   construction waste as mixed waste, which exposes poor waste data
   management. The findings of this paper will be of interest, more
   generally to researchers, who are seeking to develop big data based
   simulation tools in similar non-trivial applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB Big data, with their promise to discover valuable insights for better
   decision making, have recently attracted significant interest from both
   academia and industry. Voluminous data are generated from a variety of
   users and devices, and are to be stored and processed in powerful data
   centers. As such, there is a strong demand for building an unimpeded
   network infrastructure to gather geologically distributed and rapidly
   generated data, and move them to data centers for effective knowledge
   discovery. The express network should also be seamlessly extended to
   interconnect multiple data centers as well as interconnect the server
   nodes within a data center. In this article, we take a close look at the
   unique challenges in building such a network infrastructure for big
   data. Our study covers each and every segment in this network highway:
   the access networks that connect data sources, the Internet backbone
   that bridges them to remote data centers, as well as the dedicated
   network among data centers and within a data center. We also present two
   case studies of real-world big data applications that are empowered by
   networking, highlighting interesting and promising future research
   directions.

AB The amount of data in our industry and the world is exploding. Data is
   being collected and stored at unprecedented rates. The challenge is not
   only to store and manage the vast volume of data ("big data"), but also
   to analyze and extract meaningful value from it. There are several
   approaches to collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing big data.
   The main focus of the paper is on unstructured data analysis.
   Unstructured data refers to information that either does not have a
   pre-defined data model or does not fit well into relational tables.
   Unstructured data is the fastest growing type of data, some example
   could be imagery, sensors, telemetry, video, documents, log files, and
   e-mail data files. There are several techniques to address this problem
   space of unstructured analytics. The techniques share a common character
   tics of scale-out, elasticity and high availability. MapReduce, in
   conjunction with the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and HBase
   database, as part of the Apache Hadoop project is a modern approach to
   analyze unstructured data. Hadoop clusters are an effective means of
   processing massive volumes of data, and can be improved with the right
   architectural approach.

AB In Big Data era, telecom operators have massive data resources, such as
   user call data, user online data, user location data, network
   performance data, and so on. These data reaches PB level and is
   distributed in the NEs and interfaces. How to effectively carry out the
   collection, parsing, analysis for the amount of data to support the
   network construction, maintenance and optimization is a major
   opportunities and challenges that the telecom operators face. This paper
   proposes a big data platform (BDP) to solve the above problem for
   telecom industries. Through the collection of telecom network data, the
   BDP can realize data parsing, storage and analysis for MR(Measure
   Report), CDR(Call Detail Record), OMC(Operation and Maintenance Centre)
   data and etc. It can achieve a unified storage and management of all
   types of data. Based on BDP, operators can carry out big data analysis
   and data mining to realize the value of data. Finally, this paper builds
   a testing platform for BDP to test the performance of big data loading
   and big data analysis. The results of experiment show that the
   performance of data loading and analysis of BDP is better than
   traditional data warehouse. It can be applied by the telecom operators
   to be the foundational infrastructure to carry on the future application
   of big data.

AB Presently, a very large number of public and private data sets are
   available from local governments. In most cases, they are not
   semantically interoperable and a huge human effort would be needed to
   create integrated ontologies and knowledge base for smart city. Smart
   City ontology is not yet standardized, and a lot of research work is
   needed to identify models that can easily support the data
   reconciliation, the management of the complexity, to allow the data
   reasoning. In this paper, a system for data ingestion and reconciliation
   of smart cities related aspects as road graph, services available on the
   roads, traffic sensors etc., is proposed. The system allows managing a
   big data volume of data coming from a variety of sources considering
   both static and dynamic data. These data are mapped to a smart-city
   ontology, called KM4City (Knowledge Model for City), and stored into an
   RDF-Store where they are available for applications via SPARQL queries
   to provide new services to the users via specific applications of public
   administration and enterprises. The paper presents the process adopted
   to produce the ontology and the big data architecture for the knowledge
   base feeding on the basis of open and private data, and the mechanisms
   adopted for the data verification, reconciliation and validation. Some
   examples about the possible usage of the coherent big data knowledge
   base produced are also offered and are accessible from the RDF-store and
   related services. The article also presented the work performed about
   reconciliation algorithms and their comparative assessment and

   and Cosmos semantics. It is specifically designed and optimized for a
   broad spectrum of Big Data analytics that depend on a very high degree
   of parallel reads and writes, as well as collocation of compute and data
   for high bandwidth and low-latency access. It brings together key
   components and features of Microsoft's Cosmos file system-long used
   internally at Microsoft as the warehouse for data and analytics-and
   HDFS, and is a unified file storage solution for analytics on Azure.
   Internal and external workloads run on this unified platform.
   Distinguishing aspects of ADLS include its support for multiple storage
   tiers, exabyte scale, and comprehensive security and data sharing. We
   discuss ADLS architecture, design points, and performance.

AB Data is the lifeblood of any organization. In today's world,
   organizations recognize the vital role of data in modern business
   intelligence systems for making meaningful decisions and staying
   competitive in the field. Efficient and optimal data analytics provides
   a competitive edge to its performance and services. Major organizations
   generate, collect and process vast amounts of data, falling under the
   category of big data. Managing and analyzing the sheer volume and
   variety of big data is a cumbersome process. At the same time, proper
   utilization of the vast collection of an organization's information can
   generate meaningful insights into business tactics. In this regard, two
   of the popular data management systems in the area of big data analytics
   (i.e., data warehouse and data lake) act as platforms to accumulate the
   big data generated and used by organizations. Although seemingly
   similar, both of them differ in terms of their characteristics and
   applications. This article presents a detailed overview of the roles of
   data warehouses and data lakes in modern enterprise data management. We
   detail the definitions, characteristics and related works for the
   respective data management frameworks. Furthermore, we explain the
   architecture and design considerations of the current state of the art.
   Finally, we provide a perspective on the challenges and promising
   research directions for the future.

AB The use of freely available online data is rapidly increasing, as
   companies have detected the possibilities and the value of these data in
   their businesses. In particular, data from social media are seen as
   interesting as they can, when properly treated, assist in achieving
   customer insight into business decision making. However, the
   unstructured and uncertain nature of this kind of big data presents a
   new kind of challenge: how to evaluate the quality of data and manage
   the value of data within a big data architecture? This paper contributes
   to addressing this challenge by introducing a new architectural solution
   to evaluate and manage the quality of social media data in each
   processing phase of the big data pipeline. The proposed solution
   improves business decision making by providing real-time, validated data
   for the user. The solution is validated with an industrial case example,
   in which the customer insight is extracted from social media data in
   order to determine the customer satisfaction regarding the quality of a
   product.

AB Starting with the birth of Web 2.0, the quantity of data managed by
   large-scale web services has grown exponentially, posing new challenges
   and infrastructure requirements. This has led to new programming
   paradigms and architectural choices, such as map-reduce and NoSQL
   databases, which constitute two of the main peculiarities of the
   specialized massively distributed systems referred to as Big Data
   architectures. The underlying computer infrastructures usually face
   complexity requirements, resulting from the need for efficiency and
   speed in computing over huge evolving data sets. This is achieved by
   taking advantage from the features of new technologies, such as the
   automatic scaling and replica provisioning of Cloud environments.
   Although performances are a key issue for the considered applications,
   few performance evaluation results are currently available in this
   field. In this work we focus on investigating how a Big Data application
   designer can evaluate the performances of applications exploiting the
   Apache Hive query language for NoSQL databases, built over a Apache
   Hadoop map-reduce infrastructure.
   This paper presents a dedicated modeling language and an application,
   showing first how it is possible to ease the modeling process and second
   how the semantic gap between modeling logic and the domain can be
   reduced, by means of vertical multiformalism modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB The cloud is increasingly being used to store and process the big data.
   Many researchers have been trying to protect big data in cloud computing
   environment. Traditional security mechanisms using encryption are
   neither efficient nor suited to the task of protecting big data in the
   Cloud. In this paper, we first discuss about challenges and potential
   solutions for protecting big data in cloud computing. Second, we propose
   MetaCloudDataStorage Architecture for protecting Big Data in Cloud
   Computing Environment. This framework ensures efficient processing of
   big data in cloud computing environment and gains more business
   insights.

AB Network traffic is a rich source of information for security monitoring.
   However the increasing volume of data to treat raises issues, rendering
   holistic analysis of network traffic difficult. In this paper we propose
   a solution to cope with the tremendous amount of data to analyse for
   security monitoring perspectives. We introduce an architecture dedicated
   to security monitoring of local enterprise networks. The application
   domain of such a system is mainly network intrusion detection and
   prevention, but can be used as well for forensic analysis. This
   architecture integrates two systems, one dedicated to scalable
   distributed data storage and management and the other dedicated to data
   exploitation. DNS data, NetFlow records, HTTP traffic and honeypot data
   are mined and correlated in a distributed system that leverages state of
   the art big data solution. Data correlation schemes are proposed and
   their performance are evaluated against several well-known big data
   framework including Hadoop and Spark.

AB In recent years a considerable effort has been spent by research and
   industrial communities in the digitalization of production environments
   with the main objective of achieving a new automation paradigm, more
   flexible, responsive to changes, and safe. This paper presents the
   architecture, and discusses the benefits, of a distributed middleware
   prototype supporting a new generation of smart-factory-enabled
   applications with special attention paid to simulation tools. Devised
   within the scope of MAYA EU project, the proposed platform aims at being
   the first solution capable of empowering shop-floor
   Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPSs), providing an environment for their
   Digital Twin along the whole plant life-cycle. The platform implements a
   microservice IoT-Big Data architecture supporting the distributed
   publication of multidisciplinary simulation models, managing in an
   optimized way streams of data coming from the shop-floor for
   real-digital synchronization, ensuring security and confidentiality of

AB Advances supported by emerging wearable technologies in healthcare
   promise patients a provision of high quality of care. Wearable computing
   systems represent one of the most thrust areas used to transform
   traditional healthcare systems into active systems able to continuously
   monitor and control the patients' health in order to manage their care
   at an early stage. However, their proliferation creates challenges
   related to data management and integration. The diversity and variety of
   wearable data related to healthcare, their huge volume and their
   distribution make data processing and analytics more difficult. In this
   paper, we propose a generic semantic big data architecture based on the
   "Knowledge as a Service" approach to cope with heterogeneity and
   scalability challenges. Our main contribution focuses on enriching the
   NIST Big Data model with semantics in order to smartly understand the
   collected data, and generate more accurate and valuable information by
   correlating scattered medical data stemming from multiple wearable
   devices or/and from other distributed data sources. We have implemented
   and evaluated a Wearable KaaS platform to smartly manage heterogeneous
   data coming from wearable devices in order to assist the physicians in
   supervising the patient health evolution and keep the patient up-to-date
   about his/her status.

AB With the rapid growth in the use of various smart digital sensors, the
   Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology, which has
   contributed significantly to Industry 4.0 and the promotion of IoT-based
   smart factories, which gives rise to the new challenges of big data
   analytics and the implementation of machine learning techniques. This
   article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a
   data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing
   equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart
   manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization
   of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and
   functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data
   (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only
   provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay
   considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed
   framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection,
   data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve
   the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for
   automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features,
   followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data
   for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve
   seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical
   factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual
   systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being
   capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case
   study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from
   real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the
   BigInsights Data & AI Innovation Awards. The experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed IoT-architecture and
   techniques to address the data quality issues.

AB The Agriculture 4.0, also called Smart Agriculture or Smart Farming, is
   at the origin of the production of huge amount of data that must be
   collected, stored, and processed in a very short time. Processing this
   massive quantity of data needs to use specific infrastructure that use
   adapted IoT architectures. Our review offers a comparative panorama of
   Central Cloud, Distributed Cloud Architectures, Collaborative Computing
   Strategies, and new trends used in the context of Agriculture 4.0. In
   this review, we try to answer 4 research questions: (1) Which storage
   and processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture 4.0
   applications and respond to its peculiarities? (2) Can generic
   architectures meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? (3)
   What are the horizontal development possibilities that allow the
   transition from research to industrialization? (4) What are the vertical
   valuations possibilities to move from algorithms trained in the cloud to
   embedded or stand-alone products? For this, we compare archi-tectures
   with 8 criteria (User Proximity, Latency & Jitter, Network stability,
   high throughput, Reliability, Scalability, Cost Effectiveness,
   Maintainability), and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each
   of them.(c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

   storing, analyzing and querying personal data. A data lake stores data
   regardless of format and thus provides an intuitive way to store
   personal data fragments of any type. Metadata management is a central
   part of the lake architecture. For structured/semi-structured data
   fragments, metadata may contain information about the schema of the data
   so that the data can be transformed into queryable data objects when
   required. For unstructured data, enabling gravity pull means allowing
   third-party plugins so that the unstructured data can be analyzed and
   queried.

AB Smart cities provide citizens with smart and advanced services to
   improve their quality of life. However, it has been observed that the
   collection, storage, processing, and analysis of heterogeneous data that
   are usually borne by citizens will bear certain difficulties. The
   development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, social media,
   and other Industry 4.0 influencers pushed technology into a smart
   society's framework, bringing potential vulnerabilities to sensor data,
   services, and smart city applications. These vulnerabilities lead to
   data security problems. We propose a decentralized data management
   system for smart and secure transportation that uses blockchain and the
   Internet of Things in a sustainable smart city environment to solve the
   data vulnerability problem. A smart transportation mobility system
   demands creating an interconnected transit system to ensure flexibility
   and efficiency. This article introduces prior knowledge and then
   provides a Hyperledger Fabric-based data architecture that supports a
   secure, trusted, smart transportation system. The simulation results
   show the balance between the blockchain mining time and the number of
   blocks created. We also use the average transaction delay evaluation
   model to evaluate the model and to test the proposed system's
   performance. The system will address residents' and authorities'
   security challenges of the transportation system in smart, sustainable
   cities and lead to better governance.

AB With the increasing incentive of enterprises to ingest as much data as
   they can in what is commonly referred to as "data lakes", and with the
   recent development of multiple technologies to support this "load-first"
   paradigm, the new environment presents serious data management
   challenges. Among them, the assessment of data quality and cleaning
   large volumes of heterogeneous data sources become essential tasks in
   unveiling the value of big data.
   The coveted use of unstructured and semi-structured data in large
   volumes makes current data cleaning tools (primarily designed for
   relational data) not directly adoptable.
   We present CLAMS, a system to discover and enforce expressive integrity
   constraints from large amounts of lake data with very limited schema
   information (e.g., represented as RDF triples). This demonstration shows
   how CLAMS is able to discover the constraints and the schemas they are
   defined on simultaneously. CLAMS also introduces a scale-out solution to
   efficiently detect errors in the raw data. CLAMS interacts with human
   experts to both validate the discovered constraints and to suggest data
   repairs.
   CLAMS has been deployed in a real large-scale enterprise data lake and
   was experimented with a real data set of 1.2 billion triples. It has
   been able to spot multiple obscure data inconsistencies and errors early
   in the data processing stack, providing huge value to the enterprise.

AB Data lakes are becoming increasingly prevalent for Big Data management
   and data analytics. In contrast to traditional 'schema-on-write'
   approaches such as data warehouses, data lakes are repositories storing
   raw data in its original formats and providing a common access
   interface. Despite the strong interest raised from both academia and
   industry, there is a large body of ambiguity regarding the definition,
   functions and available technologies for data lakes. A complete,
   coherent picture of data lake challenges and solutions is still missing.
   This survey reviews the development, architectures, and systems of data
   lakes. We provide a comprehensive overview of research questions for
   designing and building data lakes. We classify the existing approaches
   and systems based on their provided functions for data lakes, which
   makes this survey a useful technical reference for designing,
   implementing and deploying data lakes. We hope that the thorough
   comparison of existing solutions and the discussion of open research
   challenges in this survey will motivate the future development of data
   lake research and practice.

AB The advent of healthcare information management systems (HIMSs)
   continues to produce large volumes of healthcare data for patient care
   and compliance and regulatory requirements at a global scale. Analysis
   of this big data allows for boundless potential outcomes for discovering
   knowledge. Big data analytics (BDA) in healthcare can, for instance,
   help determine causes of diseases, generate effective diagnoses, enhance
   QoS guarantees by increasing efficiency of the healthcare delivery and
   effectiveness and viability of treatments, generate accurate predictions
   of readmissions, enhance clinical care, and pinpoint opportunities for
   cost savings. However, BDA implementations in any domain are generally
   complicated and resource-intensive with a high failure rate and no
   roadmap or success strategies to guide the practitioners. In this paper,
   we present a comprehensive roadmap to derive insights from BDA in the
   healthcare (patient care) domain, based on the results of a systematic
   literature review. We initially determine big data characteristics for
   healthcare and then review BDA applications to healthcare in academic
   research focusing particularly on NoSQL databases. We also identify the
   limitations and challenges of these applications and justify the
   potential of NoSQL databases to address these challenges and further
   enhance BDA healthcare research. We then propose and describe a
   state-of-the-art BDA architecture called Med-BDA for healthcare domain
   which solves all current BDA challenges and is based on the latest zeta
   big data paradigm. We also present success strategies to ensure the
   working of Med-BDA along with outlining the major benefits of BDA
   applications to healthcare. Finally, we compare our work with other
   related literature reviews across twelve hallmark features to justify
   the novelty and importance of our work. The aforementioned contributions
   of our work are collectively unique and clearly present a roadmap for
   clinical administrators, practitioners and professionals to successfully
   implement BDA initiatives in their organizations.

AB The recent emergence of deep learning to characterize complex patterns
   of protein big data reveals its potential to address the classic
   challenges in the field of protein data mining. Much research has
   revealed the promise of deep learning as a powerful tool to transform
   protein big data into valuable knowledge, leading to scientific
   discoveries and practical solutions. In this review, we summarize recent
   publications on deep learning predictive approaches in the field of
   mining protein data. The application architectures of these methods
   include multilayer perceptrons, stacked autoencoders, deep belief
   networks, two- or three-dimensional convolutional neural networks,
   recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and complex neural
   networks and are described from five perspectives: residue-level
   prediction, sequence-level prediction, three-dimensional structural
   analysis, interaction prediction, and mass spectrometry data mining. The
   advantages and deficiencies of these architectures are presented in
   relation to various tasks in protein data mining. Additionally, some
   practical issues and their future directions are discussed, such as
   robust deep learning for protein noisy data, architecture optimization
   for specific tasks, efficient deep learning for limited protein data,
   multimodal deep learning for heterogeneous protein data, and
   interpretable deep learning for protein understanding. This review
   provides comprehensive perspectives on general deep learning techniques
   for protein data analysis.

AB In modern-day medicine, medical imaging has undergone immense
   advancements and can capture several biomedical images from patients. In
   the wake of this, to assist medical specialists, these images can be
   used and trained in an intelligent system in order to aid the
   determination of the different diseases that can be identified from
   analyzing these images. Classification plays an important role in this
   regard; it enhances the grouping of these images into categories of
   diseases and optimizes the next step of a computer-aided diagnosis
   system. 'the concept of classification in machine learning deals with
   the problem of identifying to which set of categories a new population
   belongs. When category membership is known, the classification is done
   on the basis of a training set of data containing observations. The goal
   of this paper is to perform a survey of classification algorithms for
   biomedical images. The paper then describes how these algorithms can be
   applied to a big data architecture by using the Spark framework. This
   paper further proposes the classification workflow based on the observed
   optimal algorithms, Support Vector Machine and Deep Learning as drawn
   from the literature. The algorithm for the feature extraction step
   during the classification process is presented and can be customized in
   all other steps of the proposed classification workflow.

AB In an era in which people, devices, infrastructures and sensors can
   constantly communicate exchanging data and, also, generating new data
   that traces many of these exchanges, vast volumes of data is generated
   giving the context for the emergence of the Big Data concept. In
   particular, recent developments in Information and Communications
   Technology (ICT) are pushing the fourth industrial revolution, Industry
   4.0, being data generated by several sources like machine controllers,
   sensors, manufacturing systems, among others. Joining the volume and
   variety of data, arriving at high velocity, with Industry 4.0, makes the
   opportunity to enhance sustainable innovation in the Factories of the
   future. In this, the collection, integration, storage, processing and
   analysis of data is a key challenge, being Big Data systems needed to
   link all the entities and data needs of the factory. In this context,
   this paper proposes a Big Data Analytics architecture that includes
   layers dedicated to deal with all data needs, from collection to

AB The use of Internet of Things (IoT) networks offers great advantages
   over wired networks, especially due to their simple installation, low
   maintenance costs, and automatic configuration. IoT facilitates the
   integration of sensing and communication for various industries,
   including smart farming and precision agriculture. For several years,
   many researchers have strived to find new sources of energy that are
   always "cleaner" and more environmentally friendly. Energy harvesting
   technology is one of the most promising environment-friendly solutions
   that extend the lifetime of these IoT devices. In this paper, the
   state-of-art of IoT energy harvesting capabilities and communication
   technologies in smart agriculture is presented. In addition, this work
   proposes a comprehensive architecture that includes big data
   technologies, IoT components, and knowledge-based systems for innovative
   farm architecture. The solution answers some of the biggest challenges
   the agriculture industry faces, especially when handling small files in
   a big data environment without impacting the computation performance.
   The so-lution is built on top of a pre-defined big data architecture
   that includes an abstraction layer of the data lake that handles data
   quality following a data migration strategy to ensure the data's
   insights. Furthermore, in this paper, we compared several machine
   learning algorithms to find the most suitable smart farming analytics
   tools in terms of forecasting and predictions.

AB Purpose
   Electric mobility as a service (eMaaS) is suggested as a possible
   solution to ease transportation and lessen environmental issues by
   providing a collaborative transport sharing infrastructure that is based
   on electric vehicles (EVs) such as electric cars, electric bicycles and
   so on. Accordingly, this study aims to propose a multi-tier architecture
   to support the collection, processing, analytics and usage of mobility
   data in providing eMaaS within smart cities. The architecture uses
   application programming interfaces to enable interoperability between
   different infrastructures required for eMaaS and allow multiple partners
   to exchange and share data for making decision regarding electric
   mobility services.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Design science methodology based on a case study by interview was used
   to collect data from an infrastructure company in Norway to verify the
   applicability of the proposed multi-tier architecture.
   Findings
   Findings suggest that the architecture offers an approach for
   collecting, aggregating, processing and provisioning of data originating
   from sources to improve electric mobility in smart cities. More
   importantly, findings from this study provide guidance for
   municipalities and policymakers in improving electric mobility services.
   Moreover, the author's findings provide a practical data-driven mobility
   use case that can be used by transport companies in deploying eMaaS in
   smart cities.
   Social implications
   This study proposes the deployment of electric mobility to address
   increased usage of vehicles, which contributes to pollution of the
   environment that has a serious effect on citizen's quality of life.
   Originality/value
   This study proposes a multi-tier architecture that stores, processes,
   analyze and provides data and related services to improve electric
   mobility within smart cities. The multi-tier architecture aims to
   support and increase eMaaS operation of EVs toward improving
   transportation services for city transport operators and citizens for
   sustainable transport and mobility system.

AB There is an increasing demand for industry-specific solutions for
   optimizing production processes with the transitions towards Industry
   4.0. The commercial greenhouse sector relies heavily on optimal use of
   energy with multiple new concepts introduced in recent years e.g.
   vertical farming and urban agriculture. Digital twins allow utilizing
   the Internet of Things and big data to simulate the alternative
   operation strategies without compromising current operation. This paper
   aims to present the development of a digital twin of the commercial
   greenhouse production process as a part of the recently launched EUDP
   funded project Greenhouse Industry 4.0 in Denmark This digital twin
   allows using big data and the Internet of Things to optimize the
   greenhouse production process and communicate with other digital twins
   representing essential areas in the greenhouse (climate and energy).
   This digital twin can estimate future states of the greenhouse by using
   past and real-time data inputs from databases, sensors, and spot
   markets. This paper also introduces a Smart Industry Architecture Model
   Framework for the discussion of the required data architecture of the
   digital twin for the greenhouse production flow which ensures a correct
   data architecture for the data exchange across all entities in the
   system.

AB Ambient intelligence is an emerging platform that provides advances in

   continuously generates several exabytes of unstructured sensor data and
   so it is often called big climate data. Nowadays, researchers are trying
   to use big climate data to monitor and predict the climate change and
   possible diseases. Traditional data processing techniques and tools are
   not capable of handling such huge amount of climate data. Hence, there
   is a need to develop advanced big data architecture for processing the
   real time climate data. The purpose of this paper is to propose a big
   data based surveillance system that analyzes spatial climate big data
   and performs continuous monitoring of correlation between climate change
   and Dengue. Proposed disease surveillance system has been implemented
   with the help of Apache Hadoop MapReduce and its supporting tools.

AB To manage supply chain efficiently, e-business organizations need to
   understand their sales effectively. Previous research has shown that
   product review plays an important role in influencing sales performance,
   especially review volume and rating. However, limited attention has been
   paid to understand how other factors moderate the effect of product
   review on online sales. This study aims to confirm the importance of
   review volume and rating on improving sales performance, and further
   examine the moderating roles of product category, answered questions,
   discount and review usefulness in such relationships. By analyzing 2939
   records of data extracted from Amazon.com using a big data architecture,
   it is found that review volume and rating have stronger influence on
   sales rank for search product than for experience product. Also, review
   usefulness significantly moderates the effects of review volume and
   rating on product sales rank. In addition, the relationship between
   review volume and sales rank is significantly moderated by both answered
   questions and discount. However, answered questions and discount do not
   have significant moderation effect on the relationship between review
   rating and sales rank. The findings expand previous literature by
   confirming important interactions between customer review features and
   other factors, and the findings provide practical guidelines to manage
   e-businesses. This study also explains a big data architecture and
   illustrates the use of big data technologies in testing theoretical
   framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm gains popularity, the next few
   years will likely witness 'servitization' of domain sensing
   functionalities. We envision a cloud-based eco-system in which high
   quality data from large numbers of independently-managed sensors is
   shared or even traded in real-time. Such an eco-system will necessarily
   have multiple stakeholders such as sensor data providers, domain
   applications that utilize sensor data (data consumers), and cloud
   infrastructure providers who may collaborate as well as compete. While
   there has been considerable research on wireless sensor networks, the
   challenges involved in building cloud-based platforms for hosting sensor
   services are largely unexplored.
   In this paper, we present our vision for data quality (DQ)-centric big
   data infrastructure for federated sensor service clouds. We first
   motivate our work by providing real-world examples. We outline the key
   features that federated sensor service clouds need to possess. This
   paper proposes a big data architecture in which DQ is pervasive
   throughout the platform. Our architecture includes a markup language
   called SDQ-ML for describing sensor services as well as for domain
   applications to express their sensor feed requirements. The paper
   explores the advantages and limitations of current big data technologies
   in building various components of the platform. We also outline our
   initial ideas towards addressing the limitations.

AB In the era of Big Data, many NoSQL databases emerged for the storage and
   later processing of vast volumes of data, using data structures that can
   follow columnar, key-value, document or graph formats. For analytical
   contexts, requiring a Big Data Warehouse, Hive is used as the driving
   force, allowing the analysis of vast amounts of data. Data models in
   Hive are usually defined taking into consideration the queries that need
   to be answered. In this work, a set of rules is presented for the
   transformation of multidimensional data models into Hive tables, making
   available data at different levels of detail. These several levels are
   suited for answering different queries, depending on the analytical
   needs. After the identification of the Hive tables, this paper
   summarizes a demonstration case in which the implementation of a
   specific Big Data architecture shows how the evolution from a
   traditional Data Warehouse to a Big Data Warehouse is possible.

AB As the largest single payer for health care in the United States, the
   Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) generates enormous
   amounts of data. Historically, CMS has faced technological challenges in
   storing, analyzing, and disseminating this information because of its
   volume and privacy concerns. However, rapid progress in the fields of
   data architecture, storage, and analysis-the big-data revolution-over
   the past several years has given CMS the capabilities to use data in new
   and innovative ways. We describe the different types of CMS data being
   used both internally and externally, and we highlight a selection of
   innovative ways in which big-data techniques are being used to generate
   actionable information from CMS data more effectively. These include the
   use of real-time analytics for program monitoring and detecting fraud
   and abuse and the increased provision of data to providers, researchers,
   beneficiaries, and other stakeholders.
