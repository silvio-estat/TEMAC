ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Snort is a well-known, signature-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The Snort sensor must be placed within the same physical network, and the defense centers in the typical NIDS architecture offer limited network coverage, especially for remote networks with a restricted bandwidth and network policy. Additionally, the growing number of sensor instances, followed by a quick increase in log data volume, has caused the present system to face big data challenges. This research paper proposes a novel design for a cloud-based Snort NIDS using containers and implementing big data in the defense center to overcome these problems. Our design consists of Docker as the sensor's platform, Apache Kafka, as the distributed messaging system, and big data technology orchestrated on lambda architecture. We conducted experiments to measure sensor deployment, optimum message delivery from the sensors to the defense center, aggregation speed, and efficiency in the data-processing performance of the defense center. We successfully developed a cloud-based Snort NIDS and found the optimum method for message-delivery from the sensor to the defense center. We also succeeded in developing the dashboard and attack maps to display the attack statistics and visualize the attacks. Our first design is reported to implement the big data architecture, namely, lambda architecture, as the defense center and utilize rapid deployment of Snort NIDS using Docker technology as the network security monitoring platform.

AB Internet, big data, global society, economy, life, politics, military, and culture are deeply integrated and have developed into an era of overlapping cyberspace and real society. Cyberspace security has become the most complex, comprehensive, and severe non-traditional security challenge facing all countries in the world. However, the talents in the field of cyberspace security cannot meet the practical needs of the development of cyberspace security. This paper puts forward the training scheme of network security talents, discusses the relationship between knowledge atlas and network space security, gives the construction and distribution of network space full knowledge atlas, and then constructs an education big data architecture for cyberspace security based on knowledge graph around the use of knowledge.

AB As the Internet grows, cybersecurity problems also arise. Different types of malicious activities have been explored by attackers. However, the existent defense mechanisms are not able to completely end the malicious threats, perpetuating this continuous arms race. The development of applications to mitigate those threats presents some complicating factors such as the growth in the amount of data, and the variety of data, that can come from different sources. In this paper we present an architecture built on top of Big Data frameworks that aims to mitigate cybersecurity problems such as spam and phishing and we show how it is being used to study spam and phishing collected using a global honeynet.

AB Although artificial intelligence has become part of everyone's real life, a trust crisis against such systems is occurring, thus increasing the need to explain black-box predictions, especially in the military, medical, and financial domains. Modern eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques focus on benchmark datasets, but the cognitive applicability of such solutions under big data settings is still unclear due to memory or computation constraints. In this paper, we extend a model-agnostic XAI methodology, named Cluster-Aided Space Transformation for Local Explanation (CASTLE), to be able to deal with high-volume datasets. CASTLE aims to explain the black-box behavior of predictive models by combining both local (i.e., based on the input sample) and global (i.e., based on the whole scope for action of the model) information. In particular, the local explanation provides a rule-based explanation for the prediction of a target instance as well as the directions to update the likelihood of the predicted class. Our extension leverages modern big data technologies (e.g., Apache Spark) to handle the high volume, variety, and velocity of huge datasets. We have evaluated the framework on five datasets, in terms of temporal efficiency, explanation quality, and model significance. Our results indicate that the proposed approach retains the high-quality explanations associated with CASTLE while efficiently handling large datasets. Importantly, it exhibits a sub-linear, rather than exponential, dependence on dataset size, making it a scalable solution for massive datasets or in any big data scenario.

AB We have designed a real-world smart building energy fault detection (SBFD) system on a cloud-based Databricks workspace, a high-performance computing (HPC) environment for big-data-intensive applications powered by Apache Spark. By avoiding a Smart Building Diagnostics as a Service approach and keeping a tightly centralized design, the rapid development and deployment of the cloud-based SBFD system was achieved within one calendar year. Thanks to Databricks' built-in scheduling interface, a continuous pipeline of real-time ingestion, integration, cleaning, and analytics workflows capable of energy consumption prediction and anomaly detection was implemented and deployed in the cloud. The system currently provides fault detection in the form of predictions and anomaly detection for 96 buildings on an active military installation. The system's various jobs all converge within 14 min on average. It facilitates the seamless interaction between our workspace and a cloud data lake storage provided for secure and automated initial ingestion of raw data provided by a third party via the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and BLOB (Binary Large Objects) file system secure protocol drivers. With a powerful Python binding to the Apache Spark distributed computing framework, PySpark, these actions were coded into collaborative notebooks and chained into the aforementioned pipeline. The pipeline was successfully managed and configured throughout the lifetime of the project and is continuing to meet our needs in deployment. In this paper, we outline the general architecture and how it differs from previous smart building diagnostics initiatives, present details surrounding the underlying technology stack of our data pipeline, and enumerate some of the necessary configuration steps required to maintain and develop this big data analytics application in the cloud.

TI Risk Chain and Key Hazard Management for Urban Rail Transit System
   Operation Based on Big Data Mining
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB With the promotion of the national transportation power strategy, super large operation networks have become an inevitable trend, and operational safety and risk management and control have become unavoidable problems. Existing safety management methods lack support from actual operational and production data, resulting in a lack of guidance of fault cause modes and risk chains. Large space is available to improve the breadth, depth, and accuracy of hazard source control. By mining multisource heterogeneous operation big data generated from subway operation, this study researches operation risk chain and refined management and control of key hidden dangers. First, it builds a data pool based on the operation status of several cities and then links them into a data lake to form an integrated data warehouse to find coupled and interactive rail transit operation risk chains. Second, it reveals and analyzes the risk correlation mechanisms behind the data and refines the key hazards in the risk chain. Finally, under the guidance of the risk chain, it deeply studies the technologies for refined control and governance of key hidden dangers. The results can truly transform rail transit operation safety from passive response to active defense, improving the special emergency rail transit operation plans, improving the current situation of low utilization of rail transit operation data, but high operation failure rate, and providing a basis for evidence-based formulation and revision of relevant industry standards and specifications.

AB Social data analytics have become a vital asset for organizations and governments. For example, over the last few years, governments started to extract knowledge and derive insights from vastly growing open data to personalize the advertisements in elections, improve government services, predict intelligence activities, as well as to improve national security and public health. A key challenge in analyzing social data is to transform the raw data generated by social actors into curated data, i.e., contextualized data and knowledge that is maintained and made available for use by end-users and applications. To address this challenge, we present the notion of knowledge lake, i.e., a contextualized Data Lake, to provide the foundation for big data analytics by automatically curating the raw social data and to prepare them for deriving insights. We present a social data curation foundry, namely DataSynapse, to enable analysts engage with social data to uncover hidden patterns and generate insight. In DataSynapse, we present a scalable algorithm to transform social items (e.g., a Tweet in Twitter) into semantic items, i.e., contextualized and curated items. This algorithm offers customizable feature extraction to harness desired features from diverse data sources. To link contextualized information items to the domain knowledge, we present a scalable technique which leverages cross document coreference resolution assisting analysts to derive targeted insights. DataSynapse is offered as an extensible and scalable microservice-based architecture that are publicly available on GitHub supporting networks such as Twitter, Facebook, GooglePlus and LinkedIn. We adopt a typical scenario for analyzing urban social issues from Twitter as it relates to the government budget, to highlight how DataSynapse significantly improves the quality of extracted knowledge compared to the classical curation pipeline (in the absence of feature extraction, enrichment and domain-linking contextualization).

AB The amount of information needed to acquire knowledge on today's acquisition systems is growing exponentially due to more complex, higher resolution, software-intensive acquisition systems that need to operate in System-of-Systems (SoS), Family-of-Systems (FoS), Joint, and Coalition environments. Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (T&E) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the T&E community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.
   The true product of T&E is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the T&E community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during T&E. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.
   Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace. The net result of these commercial best practices is a solid foundation for the DoD to transform how it uses data to achieve faster, better, and smarter decisions throughout the acquisition lifecycle.

AB Background: The COVID-19 outbreak required prompt action by health authorities around the world in response to a novel threat. With enormous amounts of information originating in sources with uncertain degree of validation and accuracy, it is essential to provide executive-level decision-makers with the most actionable, pertinent, and updated data analysis to enable them to adapt their strategy swiftly and competently.
   Objective: We report here the origination of a COVID-19 dedicated response in the Israel Defense Forces with the assembly of an operational Data Center for the Campaign against Coronavirus.
   Methods: Spearheaded by directors with clinical, operational, and data analytics orientation, a multidisciplinary team utilized existing and newly developed platforms to collect and analyze large amounts of information on an individual level in the context of SARS-CoV-2 contraction and infection.
   Results: Nearly 300,000 responses to daily questionnaires were recorded and were merged with other data sets to form a unified data lake. By using basic as well as advanced analytic tools ranging from simple aggregation and display of trends to data science application, we provided commanders and clinicians with access to trusted, accurate, and personalized information and tools that were designed to foster operational changes and mitigate the propagation of the pandemic. The developed tools aided in the in the identification of high-risk individuals for severe disease and resulted in a 30% decline in their attendance to their units. Moreover, the queue for laboratory examination for COVID-19 was optimized using a predictive model and resulted in a high true-positive rate of 20%, which is more than twice as high as the baseline rate (2.28%, 95% CI 1.63%-3.19%).
   Conclusions: In times of ambiguity and uncertainty, along with an unprecedented flux of information, health organizations may find multidisciplinary teams working to provide intelligence from diverse and rich data a key factor in providing executives relevant and actionable support for decision-making.
