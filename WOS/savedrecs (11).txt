AB Urban surveillance, of which airborne urban surveillance is a vital
   constituent, provides situational awareness (SA) and timely response to
   emergencies. The significance and scope of urban surveillance has
   increased manyfold in recent years due to the proliferation of unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs), Internet of things (IoTs), and multitude of
   sensors. In this article, we propose FogSurv-a fogassisted surveillance
   architecture and framework leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and
   information/data fusion for enabling real-time SA and monitoring. We
   also propose an AI- and data-driven information fusion model for FogSurv
   to help provide (near) real-time SA, threat assessment, and automated
   decision-making. We further present a latency model for AI and
   information fusion processing in FogSurv. We then discuss several use
   cases of FogSurv that can have a huge impact on multifarious fronts of
   national significance ranging from safeguarding national security to
   monitoring of critical infrastructures. We conduct an extensive set of
   experiments to demonstrate that FogSurv using AI and data fusion help
   provide near real-time inferences and SA. Experimental results
   demonstrate that FogSurv provides a latency improvement of 37% on
   average over cloud architectures for the selected benchmarks. Results
   further indicate that combining AI with data fusion as in FogSurv can
   provide a speedup of up to 9.8x over AI without data fusion while also
   maintaining or improving the inference accuracy. Additionally, results
   show that AI combined with fusion of different image modalities obtained
   through UAVs in FogSurv results in improved average precision of target
   detection for surveillance as compared to AI without data fusion for
   different target scales and environment complexity.

AB There are many studies adopting artificial intelligence (AI) to develop
   core technologies for the future army but they are still at the level of
   basic research. It is expected that military power will be negatively
   affected by aging and declining population. In addition, as more than
   500,000 agents will be dispatched to monitor combat scenes, the data
   sensed by each agent should be managed simultaneously recognize and
   evaluate the situation on the battlefield in real time. Despite
   increased complexity in the battlefield, current command system entirely
   rely on the experience and expertise of individual commanders, which
   severely restricts defense capabilities. Therefore, AI based military
   staff needs to be developed to identify potential threats that
   commanders are likely to miss, to develop smart command systems, and to
   provide data-driven rationale for commander's decisions. In this paper,
   we propose a deep AI military staff to support commander
   decision-making. Our proposed model is composed of four key parts:
   multi-agent based manned-unmanned collaboration architecture (MACA),
   robust tactical map fusion technology in poor environments (RTMF),
   hypergraph based representation learning (HRL) and space-time multi
   layer model for battlefields recognition (STBR). We design an
   architecture and generate dataset for training the core network.
   Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of Deep
   AI military staff.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have revolutionized
   transportation by incorporating advanced technologies for efficient and
   safe mobility. However, these systems face challenges ensuring security
   and resilience against adversarial attacks. This research addresses
   these challenges and introduces a novel Dampster-Shafer data
   fusion-based Adversarial Deep Learning (DS-ADL) Model for ITS in fog
   cloud environments. Our proposed model focuses on three levels of
   adversarial attacks: original image level, feature level, and decision
   level. Adversarial examples are generated at each level to evaluate the
   system's vulnerability comprehensively. To enhance the system's
   capabilities, we leverage the power of several vital components.
   Firstly, we employ Dempster-Shafer-based Multimodal Sensor Fusion,
   enabling the fusion of information from multiple sensors for improved
   scene understanding. This fusion approach enhances the system's
   perception and decision-making abilities. For feature extraction and
   classification, we utilize ResNet 101, a deep learning architecture
   known for its effectiveness in computer vision tasks. We introduced a
   novel Monomodal Multidimensional Gaussian Model (MMGM-DD) based
   Adversarial Detection approach to detect adversarial examples. This
   detection mechanism enhances the system's ability to identify and
   mitigate adversarial attacks in real-time. Additionally, we incorporate
   the Defensive Distillation method for adversarial training, which trains
   the model to be robust against attacks by exposing it to adversarial
   examples during the training process. To evaluate the performance of our
   proposed model, we utilize two datasets: Google Speech Command version
   0.01 and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).
   Evaluation metrics include latency delay and computation time
   (fog-cloud), accuracy, MSE, loss, and F-score for attack detection and
   defense. The results and discussions demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our Dampster-Shafer data fusion-based Adversarial Deep Learning Model in
   enhancing the robustness and security of ITS in fog-cloud environments.
   The model's ability to detect and defend against adversarial attacks
   while maintaining low-latency fog-cloud operations highlights its
   potential for real-world deployment in ITS.

AB Real-time information fusion based on WAMI (Wide-Area Motion Imagery),
   FMV (Full Motion Video), and text data is highly desired for many
   mission critical emergency or security applications. Cloud Computing has
   been considered promising to achieve big data integration from
   multi-modal sources. In many mission critical tasks, however, powerful
   Cloud technology cannot satisfy the tight latency tolerance as the
   servers are allocated far from the sensing platform. Therefore, data
   processing, information fusion, and decision making are required to be
   executed on-site (i.e., near the data collection). Fog Computing, a
   recently proposed extension and complement for Cloud Computing, enables
   computing on-site without outsourcing jobs to a remote Cloud. In this
   work, we have investigated the feasibility of processing streaming WAMI
   in the Fog for real-time, online, uninterrupted target tracking. Using a
   single target tracking algorithm, we studied the performance of a Fog
   Computing prototype. The experimental results are very encouraging that
   validate the effectiveness of our Fog approach to achieve real-time
   frame rates.

   incorporating single or multiple sensor solutions and through data
   fusion. This paper considers a single-sensor multistage hierarchical
   algorithm of acoustic signal analysis and pattern recognition for the
   identification of mobile vehicles in an open environment. The algorithm
   applies several standalone techniques to enable complex decision-making
   during event identification. Computationally inexpensive procedures are
   specifically chosen in order to provide real-time operation capability.
   The algorithm is tested on pre-recorded audio signals of civilian
   vehicles passing the measurement point and shows promising
   classification accuracy. Implementation on a specific embedded device is
   also presented and the capability of real-time operation on this device
   is demonstrated.

AB Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for solving stochastic
   optimization problems. The aerospace and defense sectors have a number
   of stochastic optimization problems that would benefit from the
   application of ML; however, people often have difficulties interpreting
   solutions arrived at via ML, which undermines trust, producing an
   obstacle to widespread adoption in these sectors. This paper introduces
   the Self-Explaining Decision Architecture (SEDA) for ML-based
   decision-making systems capable of generating intuitive explanations for
   their decisions in real time. SEDA makes use of a feature extraction
   subsystem and a sequence interpretation subsystem to identify patterns
   in data followed by a decision generation subsystem that determines
   appropriate actions based on those patterns. Internal state information
   from each of these subsystems is used to generate explanations of the
   system's decisions. Using this information to create explanations
   provides insight as to the data elements the system focused on when
   making decisions as well as the reasoning that was used. As a
   proof-of-concept, we present a first implementation of SEDA using
   start-of-the-art deep learning components including a combined
   convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network with
   attention mechanisms and demonstrate its use on both standard and custom
   datasets.

AB The management of war casualties has evolved significantly. Tactical
   tourniquets, early surgical haemostasis and massive transfusion
   protocols have all contributed to a significant decrease in war
   casualties' mortality. Large scale combat scenarios pose new and major
   challenges, as the volume of casualties is predicted to exceed available
   resources. Combat Medical Early Warning Systems (CMEWS) and wearable
   biosensors could present promising solutions in this context. An Early
   Warning System consists of three key components: data collection of
   vital signs, analysis through an Early Warning Score and a corresponding
   medical response. Biosensors, on the other hand, enable continuous
   monitoring of physiological parameters. Their miniaturisation,
   connectivity and reliability make them promising tools, though
   challenges such as accuracy, cost and data integration remain.
   Integrated CMEWS, combining biosensors with automated decision-making
   algorithms, could revolutionise the management of war casualties. These
   systems would assist in the early identification of severe war
   casualties and triage, assisting health services in casualty flow
   management. They have the potential for providing a shared, real-time
   overview of casualties' status for all healthcare providers.
   Additionally, the integration of these systems into the battlefield
   would facilitate improved coordination across medical and command
   structures, enhancing patient management even in remote or high-risk
   environments. However, the adoption of integrated CMEWS and biosensors
   faces challenges, including data security concerns, infrastructure
   limitations and the need for significant investment and training.
   Despite these hurdles, their potential to enhance casualty care,
   particularly in high-intensity conflict settings, is evident and could
   transform both military and civilian emergency medical care.

AB Unmanned Systems (UxVs) are becoming increasingly prevalent across both
   the Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial sectors. As automation
   becomes increasingly robust and systems transition from being merely
   automated to being more autonomous, there is a need for Human Machine
   Interfaces (HMI) to enable effective supervisory control of these
   systems. An ontology-driven decision support system has been designed to
   emulate Recognition-Primed Decision Making (RPD) that is exhibited in
   experts. This RPD Agent (RPDA) fuses real-time sensor data and vehicle
   telemetry with static rulesets based on tacit domain knowledge elicited
   from experts to generate Courses of Action (COA) that a user can pick
   from. By querying ontologies of human expert knowledge, real-time world
   states can be rapidly compared to instantiated rulesets to provide
   relatively novice users with extended domain expertise. By presenting
   the operator with a list of logically permissible COAs rather than
   generating the COAs themselves, one can employ effective supervisory
   control over multi-domain, multi-mission autonomy. This paper discusses
   the conceptual and functional design of the RPDA, the development of
   component domain ontologies to power the agent, conclusions, and future
   work to be performed.

AB This paper presents a real-time adaptive trajectory prediction framework
   for cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms engaged in dynamic
   target tracking within cluttered environments. The proposed system
   introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based control
   architecture combining fuzzy inference, neuroemotional learning, and
   distributed multi-agent coordination. At the core of the approach is a
   Bidirectional Fuzzy Brain Emotional Learning Prediction (BFBEL-P) model,
   which integrates fuzzy logic and an online adaptive neural structure to
   enable trajectory forecasting without pre-training or prior knowledge of
   the environment. From an engineering perspective, this AI model is
   deployed in UAV swarm navigation, where robust decision-making,
   predictive coordination, and obstacle avoidance are essential for target
   interception missions. In contrast to conventional prediction methods,
   such as curve fitting, nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), and
   deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the BFBEL-P
   framework offers fast convergence, low computational cost, and high
   adaptability. The system incorporates multi-threaded data fusion across
   the swarm to achieve consensus-driven predictions and maintain
   situational awareness, even under sensor failures or occlusions.
   Simulation results show that BFBEL-P improves short-term prediction
   accuracy by 82.2%, reduces prediction time by 15%, and achieves a 100%
   tracking success rate across benchmark scenarios. These results
   establish BFBEL-P as a reliable AI technique for distributed control in
   real-world UAV swarm applications, offering a promising tool for
   search-and-rescue, surveillance, and defense operations.

AB Cognitive radio (CR), which enables opportunistic access to
   underutilized licensed bands, has been presented as a tempting
   technology for the optimization of spectrum utilization in recent years.
   To solve the hidden terminal problem, collaborative spectrum sensing
   (CSS), which benifits from spatial diversity, has been studied
   intensively in CR networks. For current CSS schemes, secondary users
   (SUs) are generally assumed to send sensing information honestly,
   however, misbehaved SUs may report false sensing data to mislead and
   compromise the system, which is called spectrum sensing data
   falsification (SSDF) attacks. In order to defense against malicious SSDF
   attacks, certain evidence-theory-based secure sensing approaches have
   been proposed. However, in most of the current evidence-theory-based CSS
   schemes, only real-time evidence information is utilized to estimate the
   sensing reliability of cognitive users, like the difference in SNR or
   similarity degree. Inadequate consideration causes CSS system being
   vulnerable to SSDF attacks, and the correctness of global decision
   making cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a credible CSS
   scheme based on evidence theory. It evaluates the credibility of each SU
   with two indexes, which are the statistical reputation factor and the
   real-time reliability factor, respectively. In addition, considering the
   transmitted data rises with the number of SUs increasing, we propose a
   rational mass distribution (RMD) approach to adjust evidence theory to
   binary hypothesis test in spectrum sensing context. As a consequence,
   both the data volume to be transmitted and the workload at data fusion
   center has been reduced. Simulation results have proved that the
   proposed scheme is effective and robust to defense against distinctive
   SSDF attack patterns.

   trajectories to                enable autonomous initiation of security
   actions                with minimal latency. The system incorporates a  
   continuous learning mechanism into autonomous units                to
   improve decision-making efficiency and reduce                false
   positives to be adapted to security threats                over certain
   time and minimize risks to human                security personnel by

AB Objective Space-based information support is a core component of modern
   operational systems. It acquires, transmits, and processes information
   through space-based platforms to provide full-process, round-the-clock
   information support for remote precision strikes. Therefore, digital
   simulation and verification of space-based information support systems
   have become key means for combat concept design, scheme demonstration,
   and rapid capability iteration. This study examines the application of
   Model-Based Systems Engineering(MBSE) to integrated simulation of
   space-based support operations. The objective is to address key
   challenges in information representation, system interoperability, and
   integrated simulation in complex combat systems. To overcome the
   limitations of traditional simulation approaches in cross-platform
   collaboration, dynamic extensibility, and efficient integration of
   functional logic with spatiotemporal information, a multi-perspective
   modeling and simulation method based on the Discrete EVent System
   specification(DEVS) is proposed. A hybrid integrated simulation
   framework is constructed. Methods The proposed framework enables
   abstract interconnection of weapon and equipment models, plug-and-play
   integration of simulation resources, precise global time
   synchronization, and high-performance realtime communication. These
   capabilities are achieved through four core modules: data integration
   management, heterogeneous software adapters, time management control,
   and publish-subscribe mechanisms. The framework supports
   interoperability and reusability of heterogeneous simulation software.
   On this basis, a joint simulation system is designed by integrating
   system architecture development and verification software with
   spatiotemporal simulation software for visualization and reasoning.
   Message middleware supports bidirectional synchronous interaction
   between state machines and spatiotemporal models, enabling closed-loop
   verification from combat concepts to digital inference. The core
   contribution of this research is the removal of long-standing separation
   between discrete event logic describing combat functions, information
   flow, and state machines, typically modeled using Systems Modeling
   Language (SysML), and continuous physical scenes, such as spatiotemporal
   motion and sensor coverage, constructed on visualization and deduction
   platforms. Through real-time bidirectional data exchange enabled by
   message middleware, discrete command decisions drive continuous platform
   behavior, whereas dynamic changes in battlefield conditions trigger
   corresponding combat responses. Results and Discussions A complete
   closed-loop simulation of a "maritime island and reef reconnaissance
   support denial operation" scenario is conducted using the joint
   simulation system, producing effective verification results. The
   simulation reproduces the full process from space-based target detection
   to coordinated regional denial by multi-domain forces. First, a
   capability-activity-equipment analysis model for the combat mission is
   developed using the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF), generating
   equipment interaction relationships and corresponding state machines. In
   parallel, continuous construction of the combat scenario is implemented
   on the visualization and deduction platform. The entire deduction
   process is precisely synchronized with physical motion through the state
   machine model deployed in the system architecture development and
   verification platform.
   Each state transition, such as "target detection," "strike initiation,"
   and "effect evaluation," triggers corresponding spatiotemporal
   simulation activities. Platform states and environmental data fed back
   from the visualization and deduction platform then drive subsequent
   state machine evolution. Through joint simulation, the rationality and
   feasibility of the operational concept, in which multi-domain unmanned
   forces conduct reconnaissance, deterrence, and denial under space-based
   information support, are verified. The results provide an intuitive and
   high-confidence basis for decision-making in system scheme optimization.
   Conclusions This study investigates the application of model-driven
   technology to the design and validation of space-based support joint
   operation systems. A joint simulation framework enabling deep
   integration of functional logic and physical scenarios is constructed
   and validated. Unlike conventional simulation approaches that focus on
   static structures or isolated functions, the proposed framework couples
   SysML-based discrete event logic models with continuous spatiotemporal
   dynamic models through a distributed architecture consisting of one core
   platform and multiple component adapters. This approach resolves the
   long-standing separation between functional modeling and scene
   simulation. Discrete behaviors, such as command decision-making and
   state transitions, directly drive platform movement and interaction
   within realistic spatiotemporal environments. Conversely, dynamic
   battlefield changes provide real-time feedback that affects higher-level
   logical decisions, forming a bidirectional closed loop. The framework
   integrates the precision of functional logic with the intuitiveness of
   scene simulation and enables realistic reproduction of multi-domain
   collaborative operations in digital space. It provides effective support
   for system design, operational deduction, and high-confidence
   verification of space-based support joint operation systems.

AB Modern industrial energy systems are increasingly reliant on
   heterogeneous data streams from sensors, grid infrastructure, renewable
   forecasts, and cybersecurity telemetry. Effectively fusing these diverse
   sources is essential for achieving resilient, efficient, and sustainable
   operations. In this paper, we present a Fusion-based Unified Security
   and Energy efficiency approach for Industrial Systems (FUSE-IS), a novel
   multi-modal data fusion framework. FUSE-IS integrates deep
   learning-based threat detection, differential privacy mechanisms, and
   carbon-aware resource scheduling. It enhances security, privacy, and
   energy efficiency in industrial energy environments. Unlike traditional
   solutions that address these objectives in isolation, FUSE-IS employs a
   unified data fusion approach that combines these solutions. As a result,
   it enabled real-time adaptive decision-making for threat mitigation,
   data protection, and carbon-optimized computing. Experimental results
   demonstrate that FUSE-IS achieves 98.5 % detection accuracy with only
   1.2% false positives, while reducing energy consumption by 24% and
   carbon emissions by 20% compared to baseline methods. The framework
   maintains strong privacy guarantees (epsilon = 0.9) with minimal
   accuracy degradation (0.7 %). A case study on DDoS mitigation
   illustrates FUSE-IS's ability to dynamically adjust defense strategies
   based on carbon intensity fluctuations, resulting in a 27 % emission
   reduction during the attack window.

AB Significance The threat of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) impacts is
   inherently linked to humanity's future, rendering the establishment of a
   global defense system an urgent priority. The successful implementation
   of NASA's double asteroid redirection test (DART) mission and ESA's Hera
   mission have verified the feasibility of active NEA defense
   technologies. In these missions, on-board space optical payloads played
   an irreplaceable role in critical processes including target detection,
   navigation control, and impact effect assessment. For China's proposed
   first NEA defense mission, developing an independently controllable
   space optical payload system is not only essential for verifying the
   country's own defense capabilities but also contributes to the global
   NEA defense network. Given the characteristics of target asteroids,
   China's space-and ground-based deep-space monitoring resources, and
   platform capabilities, clarifying the requirements, technical features,
   and application outcomes of space optical payloads is of great
   significance for laying the foundation of China's NEA defense system.<br
   /> Progress This study systematically reviews the technical
   characteristics and application outcomes of space optical payloads in
   NEA defense missions (e. g., DART and Hera) and analyzes the payload
   configuration requirements for China's first NEA defense mission (Table
   1 and Table 2). For NASA's DART mission, the space optical payload
   inherits mature technologies from deep-space exploration and is
   optimized for defense-specific needs. The DART mission's Didymos
   reconnaissance and asteroid camera for OpNav (DRACO) serves as a
   representative example: featuring a 208 mm aperture, 2.48 mu rad angular
   resolution, and 14.5-magnitude detection capability, DRACO builds on the
   design of LORRI cameras from NASA's New Horizons and Lucy missions while
   introducing key improvements-including the replacement of charge-coupled
   devices (CCDs) with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
   sensors, adoption of global/ rolling shutter dual-mode operation,
   integration of the SMART Nav autonomous navigation algorithm, and
   improved adaptability to low-temperature environments [(-85 +/- 5)
   degrees C] (Fig. 1). These upgrades enable DRACO to achieve cm-level
   impact point positioning (1 sigma error: +/- 68 cm) for the 160 m
   asteroid Dimorphos and capture high-resolution data on the size and
   distribution of boulders on its surface. For ESA's subsequent Hera
   mission, payloads-including the asteroid framing camera (AFC), thermal
   infrared imager (TIRI), HyperScout H imaging spectrometer, and ASPECT
   hyperspectral imager-further enhance the mission's multi-dimensional
   detection capabilities. Additionally, LICIACube (a NASA auxiliary
   CubeSat for the DART mission) carries LEIA (wide-field) and LUKE
   (narrow-field) cameras, which captures images of Dimorphos' unimpacted
   hemisphere and dynamic videos of ejecta evolution processes, verifying
   the "primary mission+CubeSat" payload collaboration mode. Three core
   technical challenges in space optical payload design are addressed
   during NASA's DART mission. 1) Navigation-imaging multiplexing
   technology: DRACO employs rolling shutter mode (4.9 mu rad angular
   resolution, 30x gain) for long-range navigation (resolving low
   signal-to-noise ratio problems) and global exposure mode (2.48 mu rad
   angular resolution, 1x gain) for short-range high-precision detection
   (mitigating read noise and popcorn effects).
   Algorithm-based compensation was also implemented to correct rolling
   shutter distortion (up to 5 pixels) induced by rapid spacecraft attitude
   drift. 2) Autonomous high-precision guidance, navigation, and control:
   the SMART Nav algorithm assumes control of the spacecraft's trajectory 4
   h before impact, extracted Dimorphos' centroid via surface feature
   detection, calculates real-time 3D coordinates of the impact point, and
   reduces the orbital error to the 10 m range 10 min prior to impact. In
   the final 30 s (when ground intervention was impossible due to signal
   delay), the algorithm completes image processing and decision-making
   within 200 ms. 3) Space environment adaptability: DRACO adopts a
   Ritchey-Chr & eacute;tien optical system equipped with a lightweight
   microcrystalline glass primary mirror and Invar support (characterized
   by a low thermal expansion coefficient). It also eliminated the focusing
   mechanism to reduce weight and adopted a commercial CMOS detector
   integrated with overcurrent detection to mitigate single-event
   functional interruptions (SEFI), while exploring a low-cost technical
   approach. For China's first NEA defense mission, the target asteroid has
   a diameter of approximately 30 meters, with an unknown rotation period
   and surface properties. The mission requires its payloads to satisfy
   both engineering objectives (high-speed precision guidance and impact
   effect assessment) and scientific goals (research on orbital and
   intrinsic properties). Proposed payloads include: 1) a high-resolution
   camera (0.1 m resolution at 30 km, supporting both video and photography
   modes) for measuring asteroid shape and monitoring ejecta; 2) a
   multispectral camera (spectral range: 480-1000 nm, >= 8 bands) for
   surface topography and material research; 3) a visible-infrared
   spectrometer (spectral range: 400-1000 nm, >= 256 bands) for
   high-resolution spectral data acquisition; 4) a thermal radiation
   spectrometer (spectral range: 5-50 mu m, temperature measurement
   accuracy: +/- 2 K) to invert thermophysical drivers of orbital evolution
   (e.g., the Yarkovsky effect) through multi-source data fusion. These
   payloads leverage China's mature deep-space exploration technologies but
   require optimization to accommodate the smaller target asteroid and
   higher impact velocity.<br /> Conclusions and Prospects For China's NEA
   defense mission, the unique "flyby+impact+flyby" mode demands that
   payloads focus on dynamic monitoring, multi-dimensional comparison, and
   long-term stability. To achieve this, three key directions should be
   prioritized. 1) Strengthen scientific team-building, optimize
   parameters, and build a data platform for resource sharing. 2) Promote
   multi-payload collaboration and autonomy. 3) Optimize payload
   configuration and improve precision to compensate for limited
   ground-based observation data.By advancing these directions, China can
   build a space optical payload system with independent characteristics,
   providing technical support for its NEA defense mission and contributing
   a Chinese solution to global NEA defense.

AB In making vehicles autonomous, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is
   essential for enhancing road safety, particularly in preventing
   collisions. It allows real-time data exchange on vehicle speed,
   direction, braking behavior, and road conditions among vehicles in the
   same vicinity. This enables vehicles to overcome failures in their
   perception system, which is entirely reliable on sensors and sensor data
   fusion. This study evaluates the performance of three key V2V
   communication technologies: dedicated short-range communication (DSRC),
   ultrawideband (UWB), and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X). Each
   technology's capabilities and suitability for short-distance driving
   scenarios, such as latency, throughput, bandwidth, and packet loss, are
   examined via simulations on the Python platform. The findings indicate
   that while C-V2X excels in long-range communication and scalability with
   5G support, UWB outperforms in very short ranges (under 30 m) because of
   its centimeter-level positioning precision and ultralow latency. DSRC is
   effective in urban environments with established infrastructure,
   offering low-latency transmission for safety-critical applications. V2V
   communications also enhance autonomous system decision-making by
   integrating sensor data with external information, allowing for risk
   anticipation beyond onboard sensor ranges. The integration of 5G
   networks with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and
   edge computing in V2V systems will further advance real-time driving
   analytics and collision avoidance. This technological synergy is pivotal
   for autonomous driving and creating a safe, efficient, and connected
   transportation environment. Ultimately, UWB is ideal for short-range
   tasks because of its accuracy, whereas C-V2X is suitable for
   long-distance communication and scalability, positioning it as a key
   enabler of future intelligent transport systems.

AB Data has become increasingly crucial for decision-making and analysis
   across the United States (US) government in a complex world with
   evolving risks. The volume, velocity, and variety of data collected by
   installations require more effort to understand and synthesize the
   various types of data. For military installations to modernize and
   mitigate current and future threats, they need to revolutionize
   installation master planning. Installation master planning is the
   process of planning to develop land, facilities, and infrastructure
   while ensuring sustainability, efficient use of resources, and risk
   management. PLANNER is designed to digitize and operationalize
   integrated installation planning, automating data collection and
   organization to reduce the workforce required by master planners,
   environmental planners, and energy managers by accessing multiple data
   sources through the data lake provided by the Virtual Toolbox for
   Installation Mission Effectiveness (VTIME). It applies a comprehensive
   systems approach to identify and acquire the relevant data sources
   required for risk and resilience analysis, provides a single place to
   access and analyze the data, and provides decision support in near
   real-time.

AB Immigration Stability Doctrine A Governance-First AI Architecture for
   Modernizing the U.S. Immigration System Prepared For: The Executive
   Office of the President, The National Security Council, The Department
   of Homeland Security (DHS), The Department of Justice (DOJ), and The
   Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Distribution: Limited /
   Official Use Only Date: October 24, 2025 1. Executive Summary The United
   States immigration system, a sprawling apparatus spanning three federal
   departments and dozens of sub-agencies, has entered a state of systemic
   entropy that threatens both national security and humanitarian
   integrity. As of late 2025, the system is characterized not by its
   capacity to enforce the rule of law or adjudicate claims with precision,
   but by its "thermodynamic instability"-a persistent condition of high
   disorder defined by fragmented data architectures, disjointed
   interagency workflows, and a backlog of over 3.5 million cases that has
   rendered the immigration courts functionally paralyzed.1 This report,
   the Immigration Stability Doctrine, asserts that the root cause of this
   failure is not merely a lack of resources, but a fundamental
   architectural obsolescence. The current "reactive enforcement" model,
   predicated on industrial-era bureaucracy and disconnected legacy
   databases, is mathematically incapable of managing the complexity and
   velocity of 21st-century migration flows. This doctrine proposes a
   radical stabilization strategy: the deployment of the Immigration
   Modernization & Management Architecture (IMMA). IMMA represents a
   paradigm shift from digitizing chaos to enforcing "Constraint-Based
   Stability." It integrates the CollectiveOS intelligence
   stack-specifically the Universal Intent Layer (UIL) and the Emergent
   Linear Feedback Engine (ELFE)-to create a governance-first AI ecosystem
   where every operational action is mathematically bounded by legal,
   ethical, and safety constraints before execution.2 Unlike traditional IT
   modernization efforts that often result in "vendor lock-in" and
   disjointed pilot programs 3, IMMA establishes a unified Multi-Agent
   "Swarm" Architecture. In this model, specialized autonomous agents-Giles
   (Strategic Orchestration), Rabbit (Operational Execution), Syn
   (Immutable Memory), Cypher (Zero-Trust Security), and AION (Causal
   Simulation)-operate as a federated mesh across the jurisdictional
   boundaries of DHS, DOJ, and HHS. These agents do not merely process
   data; they actively minimize "informational drift," ensuring that the
   digital reality of a case (its status in a database) remains perfectly
   synchronized with the physical reality of the individual (their location
   and legal standing).2 Crucially, IMMA is governed by the GATA PRIME
   pipeline, a rigorous authorization layer that serves as the "Root of
   Trust" for the entire system. This framework ensures strict adherence to
   the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and Executive Order
   14110, specifically regarding "rights-impacting" AI systems.4 By
   encoding the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) as executable
   logic 6, IMMA transforms privacy and civil rights from policy
   aspirations into immutable code constraints. The stakes of this
   transformation are existential for the administrative state. The
   Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General
   (OIG) have repeatedly documented catastrophic failures in data
   sharing-from the inability to track unaccompanied children transferred
   between agencies to the reliance on paper files that vanish in transit.7
   These are not administrative nuisances; they are vulnerabilities that
   obscure the identity of threats and abandon the vulnerable to
   exploitation. The Immigration Stability Doctrine provides the technical
   and strategic roadmap to close these gaps, replacing bureaucratic
   fragility with sovereign stability. 2. Background: The Thermodynamics of
   Bureaucratic Failure To prescribe a viable architectural solution, one
   must first conduct a forensic analysis of the current system's
   pathology. The U.S. immigration apparatus does not function as a single
   organism but rather as a loose confederation of incompatible legacy
   systems, misaligned incentives, and fragmented data standards. This
   state of affairs results in what can be termed "bureaucratic
   thermodynamics," where the energy required to move a case from
   initiation to resolution increases exponentially with every interagency
   handoff, generating massive amounts of "waste heat" in the form of
   delays, errors, and litigation. 2.1 The Interagency Interoperability
   Crisis: A Fracture in Truth The most critical failure point identified
   in over a decade of federal audits is the structural inability of
   agencies to share actionable data in real-time. The GAO has highlighted
   that while DHS has established governance boards to improve information
   sharing, significant gaps remain in tracking and assessing the
   effectiveness of these initiatives.9 This fragmentation is not merely a
   technical inconvenience; it creates dangerous blind spots in the
   national security picture. This interoperability crisis is most acute at
   the "seams" of agency responsibility-the points where custody or
   jurisdiction transfers from one department to another. The migration
   lifecycle typically involves: Apprehension: U.S. Customs and Border
   Protection (CBP) apprehends an individual and generates data in the e3
   portal.10 Detention/Processing: Custody transfers to U.S. Immigration
   and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which utilizes the Enforcement Integrated
   Database (EID). Adjudication: The case is filed with the DOJ's Executive
   Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which relies on a separate, often
   paper-based, case management system (CASE).8 Care (for Minors):
   Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) are transferred to the HHS Office of
   Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which utilizes its own disparate tracking
   portal (UC Portal).7 The friction at these seams is catastrophic. The
   DHS OIG has reported that ICE cannot effectively monitor the location
   and status of UACs once they are transferred to HHS custody. In a
   startling finding, over 31,000 children's release addresses were
   recorded as blank, undeliverable, or missing apartment numbers between
   FY 2019 and FY 2023.7 This represents a "data lineage failure." Without
   a shared "Truth Anchor," a child���s status can be recorded as
   "detained" in DHS systems, "released" in HHS systems, and "unknown" to
   the immigration court. This dissonance creates an "informational drift"
   where the government's digital record diverges from physical reality,
   creating opportunities for traffickers to exploit the gap and for
   children to disappear from the protective radar of the state.7
   Furthermore, the GAO has noted that the lack of a unique identifier
   shared across components prevents the linking of family members
   apprehended together.11 This creates a scenario where parents and
   children are processed as unrelated entities, complicating reunification
   efforts and leading to the systemic failures observed during the "Zero
   Tolerance" period, where "ad hoc" tracking methods like spreadsheets
   were used in place of robust database architecture.12 2.2 The Backlog
   Singularity: A System in Collapse The Executive Office for Immigration
   Review (EOIR) is currently experiencing a "backlog singularity," a
   mathematical point where the rate of new case inputs so vastly exceeds
   the rate of adjudicative outputs that the system effectively ceases to
   function as a mechanism of justice. As of mid-2024, the pending caseload
   exceeded 3.5 million.1 This backlog has more than tripled since fiscal
   year 2017.13 This backlog creates a vicious feedback loop of
   instability. The multi-year wait times for a hearing act as a "pull
   factor," encouraging individuals with weak or non-existent claims to
   enter the system simply to benefit from the de facto residency granted
   by the delay. This influx further deepens the backlog, extending wait
   times even more. The technological substrate of the immigration courts
   exacerbates this crisis. A significant portion of case files remains
   paper-based, requiring physical transportation of files between judges,
   clerks, and attorneys.8 The GAO has noted that EOIR���s reliance on
   paper files is a primary driver of adjudication inefficiencies, creating
   single points of failure where a lost file can halt proceedings
   indefinitely. Additionally, the EOIR's electronic case management system
   lacks basic functionality, such as the ability to systematically record
   whether a respondent appeared for a hearing.14 This forces judges to
   rely on unreliable "adjournment codes" that do not provide the granular
   data necessary for workforce planning or performance management.15 Table

   Failure: High rates indicate failures in notice/service and respondent
   tracking. 2.3 The Biometric Disconnect: The IDENT to HART Transition
   Risk The biometric identity of the individual is the foundational data
   element of the immigration system. DHS is currently in a prolonged and
   risky transition from the legacy Automated Biometric Identification
   System (IDENT) to the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART)
   system.10 This transition represents a perilous period of vulnerability.
   HART is intended to serve as the biometric backbone for national
   security, hosting modal data including fingerprints, iris scans, and
   facial recognition patterns.18 However, the program has been plagued by
   delays and cost overruns. More critically, privacy impact assessments
   and external audits indicate that HART will ingest vast quantities of
   data from external agencies and foreign partners without fully matured
   privacy governance structures or "opt-out" mechanisms for U.S. citizens
   caught in the dragnet.18 The fragmentation here is operational. A CBP
   agent at a port of entry may not have immediate access to a derogatory
   biometric record held by the Department of Defense (DOD) or an
   intelligence agency if that data has not yet propagated to the primary
   inspection database. Conversely, a humanitarian protection granted by
   USCIS may not be biometrically linked to an ICE detainer, leading to the
   unlawful arrest of a protected individual. This "latency of truth" is a
   direct violator of the Constraint-First principle, as the system acts on
   incomplete information states, creating liability and risk.2 2.4 The
   Failure of Pilot Programs and "Ad Hoc" Solutions The government's
   response to these challenges has largely been reactive, characterized by
   a series of pilot programs and "ad hoc" technological patches that fail
   to address the underlying architectural rot. For example, GAO reviews of
   pilot programs intended to expedite processing along the southwest
   border found that while DHS and DOJ expedited the scheduling of
   hearings, they failed to ensure that the necessary charging documents
   (Notices to Appear) were filed with the courts in a timely manner,
   leading to dismissals and administrative chaos.3 Similarly, during the
   2019 migrant surge, DHS's fragmented approach to detention planning
   resulted in extended detention times and overcrowding, as the department
   lacked a unified model to predict and manage bed space requirements
   across its network of contractors.20 These failures demonstrate that
   adding more resources (judges, agents, beds) to a fundamentally broken
   architecture yields diminishing returns. The system requires a new
   operating doctrine. 3. System Architecture: The IMMA Platform The
   Immigration Modernization & Management Architecture (IMMA) addresses
   these structural failures by deploying the CollectiveOS multi-agent
   stack. IMMA rejects the "monolithic database" approach, which creates
   single points of failure and is historically prone to costly procurement
   collapses. Instead, IMMA establishes a federated Universal Intent Layer
   (UIL) where disparate agency systems (e.g., e3, EID, CASE, UC Portal)
   act as data providers to a unified, overlay governance mesh. 3.1 The
   Universal Intent Layer (UIL): Physics of the Bureaucracy The theoretical
   foundation of IMMA is the UIL, a constraint-based operating system
   derived from the "God File" internal specifications. The UIL posits that
   patterns precede mechanisms; in a complex system, stability is achieved
   not by micro-managing every event, but by defining the "Constraint
   Fields" that guide the system toward equilibrium.2 In the context of
   immigration, the "Legal Constraints" (the Immigration and Nationality
   Act, federal regulations, court orders, settlement agreements like
   Flores) are encoded as the primary physics of the system. The Constraint
   Field Equation: $$C(x) = \operatorname{arg\,min}_{x} \Phi(x)$$ Where:
   $x$ is the current state of an immigration case (e.g., "Pending Asylum
   Application"). $\Phi(x)$ is the "Constraint Potential," a mathematical
   representation of the legal and ethical friction associated with that
   state. A state of "Unlawful Detention" has extremely high potential
   (instability), while a state of "Lawful Permanent Residence" or
   "Executed Removal Order" has low potential (stability). $C(x)$ is the
   lawful state the system must converge toward to minimize potential.
   Instead of a human agent manually deciding the next step, the IMMA
   system calculates the path of least resistance through the constraint
   field. If an individual is granted asylum by a judge, the system
   automatically minimizes the potential $\Phi$ by triggering the necessary
   downstream actions-updating the work authorization database, notifying
   the benefits agency, closing the removal proceedings-without human data
   entry. This ensures that the "drift" between legal status and
   operational reality is zero. 3.2 The Agentic Bureaucracy: A Multi-Agent
   Swarm IMMA deploys the CollectiveOS Multi-Agent Architecture to handle
   the complexity of interagency coordination. These are not simple
   scripts; they are autonomous software entities with specific roles,
   authorities, and cryptographic identities.2 3.2.1 Giles: The Strategic
   Orchestrator Giles serves as the central adjudicative scheduler and
   resource manager. It sits above the specific agency databases, viewing
   the entire immigration lifecycle as a single supply chain. Function:
   Giles utilizes Confidence-Weighted Voting ($V = \sum w_i \cdot o_i$) to
   arbitrate conflicting data inputs.2 If DHS records an individual as a
   "Flight Risk" ($w_{DHS}$) but HHS records them as a "Vulnerable Minor"
   ($w_{HHS}$), Giles identifies the constraint conflict. It does not
   blindly accept one; it halts processing and triggers a "Constraint
   Resolution Task" for a human supervisor, preventing the "automating of
   error." Docket Management: Giles addresses the EOIR backlog by
   simulating courtroom loads and dynamically assigning cases to judges
   based on case complexity and judicial availability. It enforces the
   State Harmonization equation ($x_i \leftarrow x_i + \gamma (M - x_i)$)
   to balance workloads across the 69 immigration courts, preventing one
   court from drowning while another has capacity.2 3.2.2 Rabbit: The
   Operational Executor Rabbit is the "hands" of the system, responsible
   for execution and API interaction across the disparate legacy systems.
   Function: When CBP processes an apprehension in e3, Rabbit automatically
   instantiates the corresponding records in ICE���s EID and EOIR���s case
   management system. It eliminates the "swivel-chair" data entry that
   leads to transcription errors. Predictive Logistics: Rabbit executes the
   Predictive Update Rule ($x_{t+1}^{pred} = x_t + \beta(x_t - x_{t-1})$)
   to pre-position resources.2 By analyzing flow rates at the border,
   Rabbit can tentatively schedule court dates or reserve bed space weeks
   in advance, smoothing the logistical curve. Safety: Rabbit operates
   under strict GATA PRIME authorization. It cannot "delete" a record; it
   can only append a new state, ensuring auditability. 3.2.3 Syn: The
   Immutable Memory Syn manages the Proof Vault, an immutable,
   blockchain-anchored ledger that replaces the physical "A-File" (Alien
   File) as the single source of truth. Function: Syn ensures that every
   interaction with a migrant-every fingerprint scan, every medical
   screening, every court appearance-is cryptographically hashed and stored
   in the Proof Vault.2 This solves the "missing file" problem identified
   by the GAO.8 Even if the local EOIR server crashes or a paper file is
   lost in the mail, the Syn ledger retains the "Ground Truth" of the case
   history. Chain of Custody: Syn enables the secure handoff of UACs. When
   ICE transfers a child to HHS, Syn records the transfer of custody on the
   ledger. This creates an unbreakable chain of custody, directly
   addressing the DHS OIG finding regarding lost children.7 3.2.4 Cypher:
   The Zero-Trust Guardian Cypher enforces the Fair Information Practice
   Principles (FIPPs) at the code level, serving as the system's internal
   affairs officer. Function: Cypher wraps all data objects in a zero-trust
   envelope. When HHS requests health data from DHS-a point of contention
   in litigation 21-Cypher evaluates the request against the Privacy
   Constraint Field. It allows access only if the specific legal authority
   is cited and verified. Redaction: Cypher automatically redacts sensitive
   PII using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) techniques before sharing
   data with non-privileged agents. This ensures that analytic agents (like
   AION) can study trends without exposing individual identities,
   satisfying the Data Minimization principle of the FIPPs.6 3.2.5 AION:
   The Causal Simulator AION provides predictive capability and "red team"
   simulation. Function: AION runs continuous simulations of border flows
   and court backlogs. It uses Quantum-Logic Layer abstractions to model
   probabilistic outcomes.2 For example, AION can simulate: "If we
   implement Policy X regarding asylum thresholds, what is the probability
   of a 20% increase in family unit separation?" This allows policymakers
   to test immigration policies in a simulation environment ("in silica")
   before deployment, preventing the operational collapses seen during the
   2019 surge.20 3.3 The ELFE Stability Kernel: Solving Operational
   Oscillation The immigration system is prone to wild oscillations-hiring
   sprees followed by freezes, rapid policy shifts followed by court
   injunctions. IMMA utilizes the ELFE (Emergent Linear Feedback Engine) to
   maintain system stability. While the core mechanisms of ELFE are
   classified, the "Safe" mathematical operators are deployed to prevent
   administrative oscillation.2 The Oscillation Damping Function: $$x_{t+1}
   = x_t - \alpha \cdot (x_t - \bar{x})$$ Where: $\bar{x}$ is the
   "Equilibrium State" (e.g., the ideal caseload per judge or the optimal
   bed capacity). $\alpha$ is the damping factor (0.1 to 0.3). Application:
   When a sudden surge of migrants occurs, traditional bureaucracies
   oscillate wildly. ELFE dampens this response. Instead of immediately
   authorizing a massive, expensive contract for new facilities that may
   not be needed in a month, the system calculates the optimal resource
   allocation to maintain steady-state processing capacity. This prevents
   the "boom and bust" cycle of border enforcement resource management,
   ensuring fiscal responsibility and operational continuity. 4. National
   Security: The Sovereign Constraint Field In the modern era, national
   security is defined by information integrity and identity dominance. The
   inability to accurately identify who is in the country, where they are,
   and what their legal status represents a fundamental breach of
   sovereignty. IMMA restores security through Identity Dominance and Drift
   Minimization. 4.1 Threat Detection via Constraint Drift Current threat
   detection relies heavily on "watchlists"-static databases of known bad
   actors. While necessary, this approach is reactive. IMMA introduces
   Behavioral Constraint Drift monitoring. The system calculates the drift
   ($D$) of an individual's journey against the normative "lawful" path for
   their specific admission class. $$D = |x - C(x)|$$ If an individual
   entered on a student visa (the constraint $C(x)$) but the Syn agent
   records no university attendance and a sudden relocation to a geographic
   area associated with high-risk activity (the actual state $x$), the
   Drift ($D$) spikes. Cypher detects this anomaly not because the person
   is on a watchlist, but because their behavior fundamentally violates the
   constraints of their legal status. This allows for pre-crime
   intervention based on behavioral physics rather than retrospective
   investigation, enabling agencies to prioritize high-drift cases for
   investigation. 4.2 Securing the Biometric Backbone (HART) As DHS
   transitions to the HART system, the centralization of biometric data
   creates a massive "honeypot" risk. Risk: Centralized biometric databases
   are prime targets for adversarial AI attacks (poisoning) or future
   quantum decryption ("Harvest Now, Decrypt Later").2 Solution: IMMA
   mandates that HART data is not stored merely as raw images but as vector
   embeddings anchored in the Proof Vault. Any attempt to alter a biometric
   record (e.g., a deepfake injection or a "cleaning" of a derogatory
   record) would violate the immutable lineage maintained by Syn. Response:
   Such a violation triggers an immediate "Integrity Lockdown" by Cypher,
   isolating the compromised record and alerting the GATA PRIME authority.
   This aligns with the "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy" mandates of EO
   14110 by ensuring data integrity is mathematically provable and
   resistant to manipulation.4 4.3 Interagency Intelligence Fusion The
   Information Sharing Environment (ISE) has historically struggled with
   "need to know" silos, often preventing the dots from being connected
   before an incident.23 IMMA replaces this with "need to share"
   constraints managed by Cypher. Mechanism: Intelligence from the FBI or
   the Intelligence Community (IC) is ingested by AION as a "Constraint
   Variable." If a new threat vector emerges (e.g., a specific smuggling
   route or a new fraud pattern), AION updates the global constraint field.
   Effect: Rabbit agents at the border immediately adjust their processing
   logic to flag individuals fitting the new threat profile. This ensures
   that tactical intelligence at the edge (the Border Patrol agent's
   tablet) is synchronized with strategic intelligence at the core (the
   National Counterterrorism Center) in milliseconds, not months. 5.
   Governance Framework: The GATA Pipeline To ensure that this powerful
   autonomous system remains aligned with democratic values and federal
   law, IMMA is governed by the CollectiveOS Governance Pipeline.2 This
   pipeline integrates explicitly with the NIST AI Risk Management
   Framework (AI RMF), mapping the concepts of Map, Measure, Manage, and
   Govern to executable code.24 5.1 Step 1: QC (Quality Control) - The Data
   Integrity Layer Before any data enters the IMMA ecosystem, it must pass
   the QC gate. Mechanism: Automated validation of data completeness. For
   UACs, the system refuses to accept a digital transfer of custody from
   CBP to ICE unless all mandatory fields (medical history, family
   contacts, property inventory) are populated. NIST Mapping: This maps to
   the Measure function of NIST AI RMF-ensuring data quality and
   reliability before it is used for decision-making. This technically
   enforces the solution to the DHS OIG finding of "blank addresses".7 5.2
   Step 2: GATA (Governance, Audit, Trust, Authority) - The Ethics Layer
   This layer evaluates the intent and impact of the automated action.
   Dual-Use Check: Ensures that tools designed for humanitarian relief
   (e.g., tracking UAC locations for safety) are not repurposed for
   enforcement actions against sponsors without specific legal authority.
   This addresses the privacy and separation of powers concerns raised by
   the California Attorney General and privacy advocates.21
   Rights-Impacting Assessment: Consistent with OMB M-24-10, any AI model
   used to adjudicate asylum claims, determine detention, or assess flight
   risk is classified as "Rights-Impacting".25 GATA requires a documented
   impact assessment and a mandatory "Human-in-the-Loop" fallback protocol
   before the model can be deployed. 5.3 Step 3: GATA PRIME - The Absolute
   Authorization Layer This is the "nuclear key" of the system, the
   absolute authorization layer. Function: GATA PRIME holds the
   cryptographic keys for high-consequence actions (e.g., authorizing a
   removal flight, finalizing a deportation order, or granting permanent
   status). Constraint-Weighted Update: The system uses the equation
   $x_{t+1} = (1-\lambda)x_t + \lambda C(x_t)$ to force alignment.2 If an
   automated decision ($x_t$) drifts from the policy authorized by the GATA
   PRIME board ($C(x_t)$), the system overwrites the decision with the
   policy-compliant state. This prevents "rogue AI" scenarios or policy
   drift by field agents who might ignore new directives. 5.4 Step 4: The
   Proof Vault - Immutable Lineage Mechanism: Every decision made by Giles,
   Rabbit, or a human judge is hashed to the Proof Vault. This creates an
   unalterable audit trail. Accountability: If a wrongful deportation
   occurs, the OIG can query the Proof Vault to reconstruct the exact
   sequence of data, algorithmic weights, and human decisions that led to
   the error. This provides the "Accountability and Auditing" required by
   the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs).6 5.5 The Chief AI
   Officer (CAIO) and Governance Boards In compliance with OMB M-24-10, the
   Department of Homeland Security, DOJ, and HHS must each designate a
   Chief AI Officer (CAIO) with the authority to oversee the implementation
   of IMMA.25 AI Governance Boards: Each agency must convene an AI
   Governance Board to oversee the deployment of "Rights-Impacting" AI.
   These boards will review the "Drift Certificates" generated by the
   system and ensure that the AI's constraints remain aligned with evolving
   case law and executive policy.28 6. Operational Stabilization: Solving
   the Backlog The "Backlog Singularity" at EOIR is not just a scheduling
   problem; it is a problem of flow dynamics. IMMA treats the court docket
   not as a calendar, but as a fluid dynamics problem to be optimized by
   Giles. 6.1 Automated Docket Harmonization Currently, master calendar
   hearings-preliminary hearings used for pleading and scheduling-are
   clogged with routine matters that add no value to the adjudication but
   consume massive amounts of judicial time.16 IMMA Solution: Rabbit agents
   automatically handle routine scheduling and document ingestion. If a
   respondent has a pending application with USCIS (e.g., a visa petition),
   Giles detects the dependency. Instead of scheduling a hearing only for
   the judge to continue the case (a major source of inefficiency), Giles
   automatically administratively closes or continues the EOIR case until
   the USCIS petition is adjudicated. Impact: This "interagency handshake"
   eliminates the thousands of "status update" hearings that currently clog
   the docket, potentially reducing the active docket load by 30-40%.29 6.2
   The "Drift Certificate" for Asylum Adjudication To speed up asylum
   processing without sacrificing due process, IMMA introduces the Drift
   Certificate. Mechanism: AI agents analyze the fact pattern of an asylum
   claim against the corpus of established case law (the Constraint Field).
   The system generates a "Drift Score" ($D$). Low Drift ($D \approx 0$):
   The case closely matches established precedents for granting asylum
   (e.g., a persecution claim based on a well-documented protected ground).
   The system flags this for "Expedited Grant" review. High Drift ($D
   \tau$): The case is novel, complex, or lacks precedent. The system flags
   this for a "Deep Review" by a senior judge. Outcome: This triage allows
   the system to clear clear-cut cases rapidly, reserving scarce judicial
   resources for the complex determinations that require human judgment.
   6.3 Closing the Loop on UAC Monitoring To solve the crisis of "lost
   children" and missing addresses 7: Continuous Monitoring: Syn maintains
   a persistent "Digital Twin" of the UAC���s legal status. Cross-Agency
   Verification: If a UAC is released to a sponsor, Rabbit initiates
   periodic automated check-ins (via text, app, or case worker portal). If
   a check-in is missed, Cypher alerts the HHS case manager. Crucially, if
   the "Safety Constraint" is violated, the system can flag the case for
   ICE ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) for a welfare check,
   provided the action complies with the GATA dual-use check. This closes
   the information gap where children fall through the cracks between HHS
   care and ICE enforcement. Table 2: Projected Impact on Operational

   Civil Rights Firewall Implementing AI in immigration carries significant
   risk to civil liberties. IMMA incorporates the Fair Information Practice
   Principles (FIPPs) not as policy guidance, but as executable code
   constraints. 7.1 Policy-as-Code Implementation of FIPPs Purpose
   Specification: Data collected for the purpose of "Health Screening"
   (HHS) is tagged with a purpose:health meta-tag. If an ICE enforcement
   agent attempts to query this data for purpose:removal, the Cypher agent
   blocks the query at the database level. This strictly enforces the Use
   Limitation and Purpose Specification principles.6 Data Minimization:
   When sharing data between agencies, the system automatically strips all
   fields not legally required for the specific transaction. An agency
   requesting "status verification" receives a binary "Legal/Illegal"
   boolean response, not the full case file containing sensitive medical or
   family data.6 7.2 The Unreadable Machine IMMA utilizes Fully Homomorphic
   Encryption (FHE). This allows the AI (Giles/AION) to perform
   computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. Scenario:
   AION can analyze the aggregate health data of detainees to predict
   disease outbreaks or resource needs without ever "seeing" a single
   patient's name or medical record. This satisfies the NIST Privacy
   Framework requirements and protects the system from becoming a tool for
   mass surveillance or "dragnet" analytics.25 7.3 Rights-Impacting AI
   Compliance (EO 14110) Consistent with OMB M-24-10, the IMMA Governance
   Board must annually certify that the system���s predictive models do not
   exhibit algorithmic bias against protected classes. Testing: AION runs
   counterfactual simulations ("If this applicant were of a different
   nationality or gender, would the Drift Score change?"). If bias is
   detected ($D_{bias} 0$), the model is automatically suspended by GATA
   PRIME until retrained. This ensures compliance with the Advancing Equity
   and Civil Rights provisions of EO 14110.26 8. Interagency Alignment: The
   Unified Constraint Field The ultimate failure of the current system is
   the lack of a shared reality. DHS sees "Aliens," DOJ sees "Respondents,"
   and HHS sees "Minors." To function effectively, the government must see
   "Entities" with a unified, truthful history. 8.1 The "Golden Record" via
   Syn IMMA mandates a single, shared definition of the entity, stored in
   the Proof Vault. Implementation: A "Federated Identity Broker" service.
   When a user is updated in DHS EID (e.g., an address change), the change
   propagates to EOIR���s case management system and HHS���s UAC portal via
   the GEM Bus (Global Event Message Bus).2 This ensures that all agencies
   are operating on the same version of the truth, eliminating the "blank
   address" problem where notices are sent to the wrong location. 8.2 The
   Joint Interagency Coordination Group (JIACG-I) To manage the human side
   of this alignment, the doctrine establishes a permanent JIACG-I
   co-chaired by the Deputy Secretaries of DHS, DOJ, and HHS. Role: This
   group serves as the GATA PRIME Authority. They hold the ultimate
   decision power over the "Constraint Weights" ($\lambda$) used by the AI
   agents. They decide, for example, whether the system should prioritize
   "Speed of Removal" or "Completeness of Due Process" in the algorithmic
   weighting.

AB Immigration Stability Doctrine A Governance-First AI Architecture for
   Modernizing the U.S. Immigration System Prepared For: The Executive
   Office of the President, The National Security Council, The Department
   of Homeland Security (DHS), The Department of Justice (DOJ), and The
   Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Distribution: Limited /
   Official Use Only Date: October 24, 2025 1. Executive Summary The United
   States immigration system, a sprawling apparatus spanning three federal
   departments and dozens of sub-agencies, has entered a state of systemic
   entropy that threatens both national security and humanitarian
   integrity. As of late 2025, the system is characterized not by its
   capacity to enforce the rule of law or adjudicate claims with precision,
   but by its "thermodynamic instability"-a persistent condition of high
   disorder defined by fragmented data architectures, disjointed
   interagency workflows, and a backlog of over 3.5 million cases that has
   rendered the immigration courts functionally paralyzed.1 This report,
   the Immigration Stability Doctrine, asserts that the root cause of this
   failure is not merely a lack of resources, but a fundamental
   architectural obsolescence. The current "reactive enforcement" model,
   predicated on industrial-era bureaucracy and disconnected legacy
   databases, is mathematically incapable of managing the complexity and
   velocity of 21st-century migration flows. This doctrine proposes a
   radical stabilization strategy: the deployment of the Immigration
   Modernization & Management Architecture (IMMA). IMMA represents a
   paradigm shift from digitizing chaos to enforcing "Constraint-Based
   Stability." It integrates the CollectiveOS intelligence
   stack-specifically the Universal Intent Layer (UIL) and the Emergent
   Linear Feedback Engine (ELFE)-to create a governance-first AI ecosystem
   where every operational action is mathematically bounded by legal,
   ethical, and safety constraints before execution.2 Unlike traditional IT
   modernization efforts that often result in "vendor lock-in" and
   disjointed pilot programs 3, IMMA establishes a unified Multi-Agent
   "Swarm" Architecture. In this model, specialized autonomous agents-Giles
   (Strategic Orchestration), Rabbit (Operational Execution), Syn
   (Immutable Memory), Cypher (Zero-Trust Security), and AION (Causal
   Simulation)-operate as a federated mesh across the jurisdictional
   boundaries of DHS, DOJ, and HHS. These agents do not merely process
   data; they actively minimize "informational drift," ensuring that the
   digital reality of a case (its status in a database) remains perfectly
   synchronized with the physical reality of the individual (their location
   and legal standing).2 Crucially, IMMA is governed by the GATA PRIME
   pipeline, a rigorous authorization layer that serves as the "Root of
   Trust" for the entire system. This framework ensures strict adherence to
   the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and Executive Order
   14110, specifically regarding "rights-impacting" AI systems.4 By
   encoding the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) as executable
   logic 6, IMMA transforms privacy and civil rights from policy
   aspirations into immutable code constraints. The stakes of this
   transformation are existential for the administrative state. The
   Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General
   (OIG) have repeatedly documented catastrophic failures in data
   sharing-from the inability to track unaccompanied children transferred
   between agencies to the reliance on paper files that vanish in transit.7
   These are not administrative nuisances; they are vulnerabilities that
   obscure the identity of threats and abandon the vulnerable to
   exploitation. The Immigration Stability Doctrine provides the technical
   and strategic roadmap to close these gaps, replacing bureaucratic
   fragility with sovereign stability. 2. Background: The Thermodynamics of
   Bureaucratic Failure To prescribe a viable architectural solution, one
   must first conduct a forensic analysis of the current system's
   pathology. The U.S. immigration apparatus does not function as a single
   organism but rather as a loose confederation of incompatible legacy
   systems, misaligned incentives, and fragmented data standards. This
   state of affairs results in what can be termed "bureaucratic
   thermodynamics," where the energy required to move a case from
   initiation to resolution increases exponentially with every interagency
   handoff, generating massive amounts of "waste heat" in the form of
   delays, errors, and litigation. 2.1 The Interagency Interoperability
   Crisis: A Fracture in Truth The most critical failure point identified
   in over a decade of federal audits is the structural inability of
   agencies to share actionable data in real-time. The GAO has highlighted
   that while DHS has established governance boards to improve information
   sharing, significant gaps remain in tracking and assessing the
   effectiveness of these initiatives.9 This fragmentation is not merely a
   technical inconvenience; it creates dangerous blind spots in the
   national security picture. This interoperability crisis is most acute at
   the "seams" of agency responsibility-the points where custody or
   jurisdiction transfers from one department to another. The migration
   lifecycle typically involves: Apprehension: U.S. Customs and Border
   Protection (CBP) apprehends an individual and generates data in the e3
   portal.10 Detention/Processing: Custody transfers to U.S. Immigration
   and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which utilizes the Enforcement Integrated
   Database (EID). Adjudication: The case is filed with the DOJ's Executive
   Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which relies on a separate, often
   paper-based, case management system (CASE).8 Care (for Minors):
   Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) are transferred to the HHS Office of
   Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which utilizes its own disparate tracking
   portal (UC Portal).7 The friction at these seams is catastrophic. The
   DHS OIG has reported that ICE cannot effectively monitor the location
   and status of UACs once they are transferred to HHS custody. In a
   startling finding, over 31,000 children's release addresses were
   recorded as blank, undeliverable, or missing apartment numbers between
   FY 2019 and FY 2023.7 This represents a "data lineage failure." Without
   a shared "Truth Anchor," a child���s status can be recorded as
   "detained" in DHS systems, "released" in HHS systems, and "unknown" to
   the immigration court. This dissonance creates an "informational drift"
   where the government's digital record diverges from physical reality,
   creating opportunities for traffickers to exploit the gap and for
   children to disappear from the protective radar of the state.7
   Furthermore, the GAO has noted that the lack of a unique identifier
   shared across components prevents the linking of family members
   apprehended together.11 This creates a scenario where parents and
   children are processed as unrelated entities, complicating reunification
   efforts and leading to the systemic failures observed during the "Zero
   Tolerance" period, where "ad hoc" tracking methods like spreadsheets
   were used in place of robust database architecture.12 2.2 The Backlog
   Singularity: A System in Collapse The Executive Office for Immigration
   Review (EOIR) is currently experiencing a "backlog singularity," a
   mathematical point where the rate of new case inputs so vastly exceeds
   the rate of adjudicative outputs that the system effectively ceases to
   function as a mechanism of justice. As of mid-2024, the pending caseload
   exceeded 3.5 million.1 This backlog has more than tripled since fiscal
   year 2017.13 This backlog creates a vicious feedback loop of
   instability. The multi-year wait times for a hearing act as a "pull
   factor," encouraging individuals with weak or non-existent claims to
   enter the system simply to benefit from the de facto residency granted
   by the delay. This influx further deepens the backlog, extending wait
   times even more. The technological substrate of the immigration courts
   exacerbates this crisis. A significant portion of case files remains
   paper-based, requiring physical transportation of files between judges,
   clerks, and attorneys.8 The GAO has noted that EOIR���s reliance on
   paper files is a primary driver of adjudication inefficiencies, creating
   single points of failure where a lost file can halt proceedings
   indefinitely. Additionally, the EOIR's electronic case management system
   lacks basic functionality, such as the ability to systematically record
   whether a respondent appeared for a hearing.14 This forces judges to
   rely on unreliable "adjournment codes" that do not provide the granular
   data necessary for workforce planning or performance management.15 Table

   Failure: High rates indicate failures in notice/service and respondent
   tracking. 2.3 The Biometric Disconnect: The IDENT to HART Transition
   Risk The biometric identity of the individual is the foundational data
   element of the immigration system. DHS is currently in a prolonged and
   risky transition from the legacy Automated Biometric Identification
   System (IDENT) to the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART)
   system.10 This transition represents a perilous period of vulnerability.
   HART is intended to serve as the biometric backbone for national
   security, hosting modal data including fingerprints, iris scans, and
   facial recognition patterns.18 However, the program has been plagued by
   delays and cost overruns. More critically, privacy impact assessments
   and external audits indicate that HART will ingest vast quantities of
   data from external agencies and foreign partners without fully matured
   privacy governance structures or "opt-out" mechanisms for U.S. citizens
   caught in the dragnet.18 The fragmentation here is operational. A CBP
   agent at a port of entry may not have immediate access to a derogatory
   biometric record held by the Department of Defense (DOD) or an
   intelligence agency if that data has not yet propagated to the primary
   inspection database. Conversely, a humanitarian protection granted by
   USCIS may not be biometrically linked to an ICE detainer, leading to the
   unlawful arrest of a protected individual. This "latency of truth" is a
   direct violator of the Constraint-First principle, as the system acts on
   incomplete information states, creating liability and risk.2 2.4 The
   Failure of Pilot Programs and "Ad Hoc" Solutions The government's
   response to these challenges has largely been reactive, characterized by
   a series of pilot programs and "ad hoc" technological patches that fail
   to address the underlying architectural rot. For example, GAO reviews of
   pilot programs intended to expedite processing along the southwest
   border found that while DHS and DOJ expedited the scheduling of
   hearings, they failed to ensure that the necessary charging documents
   (Notices to Appear) were filed with the courts in a timely manner,
   leading to dismissals and administrative chaos.3 Similarly, during the
   2019 migrant surge, DHS's fragmented approach to detention planning
   resulted in extended detention times and overcrowding, as the department
   lacked a unified model to predict and manage bed space requirements
   across its network of contractors.20 These failures demonstrate that
   adding more resources (judges, agents, beds) to a fundamentally broken
   architecture yields diminishing returns. The system requires a new
   operating doctrine. 3. System Architecture: The IMMA Platform The
   Immigration Modernization & Management Architecture (IMMA) addresses
   these structural failures by deploying the CollectiveOS multi-agent
   stack. IMMA rejects the "monolithic database" approach, which creates
   single points of failure and is historically prone to costly procurement
   collapses. Instead, IMMA establishes a federated Universal Intent Layer
   (UIL) where disparate agency systems (e.g., e3, EID, CASE, UC Portal)
   act as data providers to a unified, overlay governance mesh. 3.1 The
   Universal Intent Layer (UIL): Physics of the Bureaucracy The theoretical
   foundation of IMMA is the UIL, a constraint-based operating system
   derived from the "God File" internal specifications. The UIL posits that
   patterns precede mechanisms; in a complex system, stability is achieved
   not by micro-managing every event, but by defining the "Constraint
   Fields" that guide the system toward equilibrium.2 In the context of
   immigration, the "Legal Constraints" (the Immigration and Nationality
   Act, federal regulations, court orders, settlement agreements like
   Flores) are encoded as the primary physics of the system. The Constraint
   Field Equation: $$C(x) = \operatorname{arg\,min}_{x} \Phi(x)$$ Where:
   $x$ is the current state of an immigration case (e.g., "Pending Asylum
   Application"). $\Phi(x)$ is the "Constraint Potential," a mathematical
   representation of the legal and ethical friction associated with that
   state. A state of "Unlawful Detention" has extremely high potential
   (instability), while a state of "Lawful Permanent Residence" or
   "Executed Removal Order" has low potential (stability). $C(x)$ is the
   lawful state the system must converge toward to minimize potential.
   Instead of a human agent manually deciding the next step, the IMMA
   system calculates the path of least resistance through the constraint
   field. If an individual is granted asylum by a judge, the system
   automatically minimizes the potential $\Phi$ by triggering the necessary
   downstream actions-updating the work authorization database, notifying
   the benefits agency, closing the removal proceedings-without human data
   entry. This ensures that the "drift" between legal status and
   operational reality is zero. 3.2 The Agentic Bureaucracy: A Multi-Agent
   Swarm IMMA deploys the CollectiveOS Multi-Agent Architecture to handle
   the complexity of interagency coordination. These are not simple
   scripts; they are autonomous software entities with specific roles,
   authorities, and cryptographic identities.2 3.2.1 Giles: The Strategic
   Orchestrator Giles serves as the central adjudicative scheduler and
   resource manager. It sits above the specific agency databases, viewing
   the entire immigration lifecycle as a single supply chain. Function:
   Giles utilizes Confidence-Weighted Voting ($V = \sum w_i \cdot o_i$) to
   arbitrate conflicting data inputs.2 If DHS records an individual as a
   "Flight Risk" ($w_{DHS}$) but HHS records them as a "Vulnerable Minor"
   ($w_{HHS}$), Giles identifies the constraint conflict. It does not
   blindly accept one; it halts processing and triggers a "Constraint
   Resolution Task" for a human supervisor, preventing the "automating of
   error." Docket Management: Giles addresses the EOIR backlog by
   simulating courtroom loads and dynamically assigning cases to judges
   based on case complexity and judicial availability. It enforces the
   State Harmonization equation ($x_i \leftarrow x_i + \gamma (M - x_i)$)
   to balance workloads across the 69 immigration courts, preventing one
   court from drowning while another has capacity.2 3.2.2 Rabbit: The
   Operational Executor Rabbit is the "hands" of the system, responsible
   for execution and API interaction across the disparate legacy systems.
   Function: When CBP processes an apprehension in e3, Rabbit automatically
   instantiates the corresponding records in ICE���s EID and EOIR���s case
   management system. It eliminates the "swivel-chair" data entry that
   leads to transcription errors. Predictive Logistics: Rabbit executes the
   Predictive Update Rule ($x_{t+1}^{pred} = x_t + \beta(x_t - x_{t-1})$)
   to pre-position resources.2 By analyzing flow rates at the border,
   Rabbit can tentatively schedule court dates or reserve bed space weeks
   in advance, smoothing the logistical curve. Safety: Rabbit operates
   under strict GATA PRIME authorization. It cannot "delete" a record; it
   can only append a new state, ensuring auditability. 3.2.3 Syn: The
   Immutable Memory Syn manages the Proof Vault, an immutable,
   blockchain-anchored ledger that replaces the physical "A-File" (Alien
   File) as the single source of truth. Function: Syn ensures that every
   interaction with a migrant-every fingerprint scan, every medical
   screening, every court appearance-is cryptographically hashed and stored
   in the Proof Vault.2 This solves the "missing file" problem identified
   by the GAO.8 Even if the local EOIR server crashes or a paper file is
   lost in the mail, the Syn ledger retains the "Ground Truth" of the case
   history. Chain of Custody: Syn enables the secure handoff of UACs. When
   ICE transfers a child to HHS, Syn records the transfer of custody on the
   ledger. This creates an unbreakable chain of custody, directly
   addressing the DHS OIG finding regarding lost children.7 3.2.4 Cypher:
   The Zero-Trust Guardian Cypher enforces the Fair Information Practice
   Principles (FIPPs) at the code level, serving as the system's internal
   affairs officer. Function: Cypher wraps all data objects in a zero-trust
   envelope. When HHS requests health data from DHS-a point of contention
   in litigation 21-Cypher evaluates the request against the Privacy
   Constraint Field. It allows access only if the specific legal authority
   is cited and verified. Redaction: Cypher automatically redacts sensitive
   PII using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) techniques before sharing
   data with non-privileged agents. This ensures that analytic agents (like
   AION) can study trends without exposing individual identities,
   satisfying the Data Minimization principle of the FIPPs.6 3.2.5 AION:
   The Causal Simulator AION provides predictive capability and "red team"
   simulation. Function: AION runs continuous simulations of border flows
   and court backlogs. It uses Quantum-Logic Layer abstractions to model
   probabilistic outcomes.2 For example, AION can simulate: "If we
   implement Policy X regarding asylum thresholds, what is the probability
   of a 20% increase in family unit separation?" This allows policymakers
   to test immigration policies in a simulation environment ("in silica")
   before deployment, preventing the operational collapses seen during the
   2019 surge.20 3.3 The ELFE Stability Kernel: Solving Operational
   Oscillation The immigration system is prone to wild oscillations-hiring
   sprees followed by freezes, rapid policy shifts followed by court
   injunctions. IMMA utilizes the ELFE (Emergent Linear Feedback Engine) to
   maintain system stability. While the core mechanisms of ELFE are
   classified, the "Safe" mathematical operators are deployed to prevent
   administrative oscillation.2 The Oscillation Damping Function: $$x_{t+1}
   = x_t - \alpha \cdot (x_t - \bar{x})$$ Where: $\bar{x}$ is the
   "Equilibrium State" (e.g., the ideal caseload per judge or the optimal
   bed capacity). $\alpha$ is the damping factor (0.1 to 0.3). Application:
   When a sudden surge of migrants occurs, traditional bureaucracies
   oscillate wildly. ELFE dampens this response. Instead of immediately
   authorizing a massive, expensive contract for new facilities that may
   not be needed in a month, the system calculates the optimal resource
   allocation to maintain steady-state processing capacity. This prevents
   the "boom and bust" cycle of border enforcement resource management,
   ensuring fiscal responsibility and operational continuity. 4. National
   Security: The Sovereign Constraint Field In the modern era, national
   security is defined by information integrity and identity dominance. The
   inability to accurately identify who is in the country, where they are,
   and what their legal status represents a fundamental breach of
   sovereignty. IMMA restores security through Identity Dominance and Drift
   Minimization. 4.1 Threat Detection via Constraint Drift Current threat
   detection relies heavily on "watchlists"-static databases of known bad
   actors. While necessary, this approach is reactive. IMMA introduces
   Behavioral Constraint Drift monitoring. The system calculates the drift
   ($D$) of an individual's journey against the normative "lawful" path for
   their specific admission class. $$D = |x - C(x)|$$ If an individual
   entered on a student visa (the constraint $C(x)$) but the Syn agent
   records no university attendance and a sudden relocation to a geographic
   area associated with high-risk activity (the actual state $x$), the
   Drift ($D$) spikes. Cypher detects this anomaly not because the person
   is on a watchlist, but because their behavior fundamentally violates the
   constraints of their legal status. This allows for pre-crime
   intervention based on behavioral physics rather than retrospective
   investigation, enabling agencies to prioritize high-drift cases for
   investigation. 4.2 Securing the Biometric Backbone (HART) As DHS
   transitions to the HART system, the centralization of biometric data
   creates a massive "honeypot" risk. Risk: Centralized biometric databases
   are prime targets for adversarial AI attacks (poisoning) or future
   quantum decryption ("Harvest Now, Decrypt Later").2 Solution: IMMA
   mandates that HART data is not stored merely as raw images but as vector
   embeddings anchored in the Proof Vault. Any attempt to alter a biometric
   record (e.g., a deepfake injection or a "cleaning" of a derogatory
   record) would violate the immutable lineage maintained by Syn. Response:
   Such a violation triggers an immediate "Integrity Lockdown" by Cypher,
   isolating the compromised record and alerting the GATA PRIME authority.
   This aligns with the "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy" mandates of EO
   14110 by ensuring data integrity is mathematically provable and
   resistant to manipulation.4 4.3 Interagency Intelligence Fusion The
   Information Sharing Environment (ISE) has historically struggled with
   "need to know" silos, often preventing the dots from being connected
   before an incident.23 IMMA replaces this with "need to share"
   constraints managed by Cypher. Mechanism: Intelligence from the FBI or
   the Intelligence Community (IC) is ingested by AION as a "Constraint
   Variable." If a new threat vector emerges (e.g., a specific smuggling
   route or a new fraud pattern), AION updates the global constraint field.
   Effect: Rabbit agents at the border immediately adjust their processing
   logic to flag individuals fitting the new threat profile. This ensures
   that tactical intelligence at the edge (the Border Patrol agent's
   tablet) is synchronized with strategic intelligence at the core (the
   National Counterterrorism Center) in milliseconds, not months. 5.
   Governance Framework: The GATA Pipeline To ensure that this powerful
   autonomous system remains aligned with democratic values and federal
   law, IMMA is governed by the CollectiveOS Governance Pipeline.2 This
   pipeline integrates explicitly with the NIST AI Risk Management
   Framework (AI RMF), mapping the concepts of Map, Measure, Manage, and
   Govern to executable code.24 5.1 Step 1: QC (Quality Control) - The Data
   Integrity Layer Before any data enters the IMMA ecosystem, it must pass
   the QC gate. Mechanism: Automated validation of data completeness. For
   UACs, the system refuses to accept a digital transfer of custody from
   CBP to ICE unless all mandatory fields (medical history, family
   contacts, property inventory) are populated. NIST Mapping: This maps to
   the Measure function of NIST AI RMF-ensuring data quality and
   reliability before it is used for decision-making. This technically
   enforces the solution to the DHS OIG finding of "blank addresses".7 5.2
   Step 2: GATA (Governance, Audit, Trust, Authority) - The Ethics Layer
   This layer evaluates the intent and impact of the automated action.
   Dual-Use Check: Ensures that tools designed for humanitarian relief
   (e.g., tracking UAC locations for safety) are not repurposed for
   enforcement actions against sponsors without specific legal authority.
   This addresses the privacy and separation of powers concerns raised by
   the California Attorney General and privacy advocates.21
   Rights-Impacting Assessment: Consistent with OMB M-24-10, any AI model
   used to adjudicate asylum claims, determine detention, or assess flight
   risk is classified as "Rights-Impacting".25 GATA requires a documented
   impact assessment and a mandatory "Human-in-the-Loop" fallback protocol
   before the model can be deployed. 5.3 Step 3: GATA PRIME - The Absolute
   Authorization Layer This is the "nuclear key" of the system, the
   absolute authorization layer. Function: GATA PRIME holds the
   cryptographic keys for high-consequence actions (e.g., authorizing a
   removal flight, finalizing a deportation order, or granting permanent
   status). Constraint-Weighted Update: The system uses the equation
   $x_{t+1} = (1-\lambda)x_t + \lambda C(x_t)$ to force alignment.2 If an
   automated decision ($x_t$) drifts from the policy authorized by the GATA
   PRIME board ($C(x_t)$), the system overwrites the decision with the
   policy-compliant state. This prevents "rogue AI" scenarios or policy
   drift by field agents who might ignore new directives. 5.4 Step 4: The
   Proof Vault - Immutable Lineage Mechanism: Every decision made by Giles,
   Rabbit, or a human judge is hashed to the Proof Vault. This creates an
   unalterable audit trail. Accountability: If a wrongful deportation
   occurs, the OIG can query the Proof Vault to reconstruct the exact
   sequence of data, algorithmic weights, and human decisions that led to
   the error. This provides the "Accountability and Auditing" required by
   the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs).6 5.5 The Chief AI
   Officer (CAIO) and Governance Boards In compliance with OMB M-24-10, the
   Department of Homeland Security, DOJ, and HHS must each designate a
   Chief AI Officer (CAIO) with the authority to oversee the implementation
   of IMMA.25 AI Governance Boards: Each agency must convene an AI
   Governance Board to oversee the deployment of "Rights-Impacting" AI.
   These boards will review the "Drift Certificates" generated by the
   system and ensure that the AI's constraints remain aligned with evolving
   case law and executive policy.28 6. Operational Stabilization: Solving
   the Backlog The "Backlog Singularity" at EOIR is not just a scheduling
   problem; it is a problem of flow dynamics. IMMA treats the court docket
   not as a calendar, but as a fluid dynamics problem to be optimized by
   Giles. 6.1 Automated Docket Harmonization Currently, master calendar
   hearings-preliminary hearings used for pleading and scheduling-are
   clogged with routine matters that add no value to the adjudication but
   consume massive amounts of judicial time.16 IMMA Solution: Rabbit agents
   automatically handle routine scheduling and document ingestion. If a
   respondent has a pending application with USCIS (e.g., a visa petition),
   Giles detects the dependency. Instead of scheduling a hearing only for
   the judge to continue the case (a major source of inefficiency), Giles
   automatically administratively closes or continues the EOIR case until
   the USCIS petition is adjudicated. Impact: This "interagency handshake"
   eliminates the thousands of "status update" hearings that currently clog
   the docket, potentially reducing the active docket load by 30-40%.29 6.2
   The "Drift Certificate" for Asylum Adjudication To speed up asylum
   processing without sacrificing due process, IMMA introduces the Drift
   Certificate. Mechanism: AI agents analyze the fact pattern of an asylum
   claim against the corpus of established case law (the Constraint Field).
   The system generates a "Drift Score" ($D$). Low Drift ($D \approx 0$):
   The case closely matches established precedents for granting asylum
   (e.g., a persecution claim based on a well-documented protected ground).
   The system flags this for "Expedited Grant" review. High Drift ($D
   \tau$): The case is novel, complex, or lacks precedent. The system flags
   this for a "Deep Review" by a senior judge. Outcome: This triage allows
   the system to clear clear-cut cases rapidly, reserving scarce judicial
   resources for the complex determinations that require human judgment.
   6.3 Closing the Loop on UAC Monitoring To solve the crisis of "lost
   children" and missing addresses 7: Continuous Monitoring: Syn maintains
   a persistent "Digital Twin" of the UAC���s legal status. Cross-Agency
   Verification: If a UAC is released to a sponsor, Rabbit initiates
   periodic automated check-ins (via text, app, or case worker portal). If
   a check-in is missed, Cypher alerts the HHS case manager. Crucially, if
   the "Safety Constraint" is violated, the system can flag the case for
   ICE ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) for a welfare check,
   provided the action complies with the GATA dual-use check. This closes
   the information gap where children fall through the cracks between HHS
   care and ICE enforcement. Table 2: Projected Impact on Operational

   Giles Orchestration & Predictive Update 7. Safeguards: The Privacy &
   Civil Rights Firewall Implementing AI in immigration carries significant
   risk to civil liberties. IMMA incorporates the Fair Information Practice
   Principles (FIPPs) not as policy guidance, but as executable code
   constraints. 7.1 Policy-as-Code Implementation of FIPPs Purpose
   Specification: Data collected for the purpose of "Health Screening"
   (HHS) is tagged with a purpose:health meta-tag. If an ICE enforcement
   agent attempts to query this data for purpose:removal, the Cypher agent
   blocks the query at the database level. This strictly enforces the Use
   Limitation and Purpose Specification principles.6 Data Minimization:
   When sharing data between agencies, the system automatically strips all
   fields not legally required for the specific transaction. An agency
   requesting "status verification" receives a binary "Legal/Illegal"
   boolean response, not the full case file containing sensitive medical or
   family data.6 7.2 The Unreadable Machine IMMA utilizes Fully Homomorphic
   Encryption (FHE). This allows the AI (Giles/AION) to perform
   computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. Scenario:
   AION can analyze the aggregate health data of detainees to predict
   disease outbreaks or resource needs without ever "seeing" a single
   patient's name or medical record. This satisfies the NIST Privacy
   Framework requirements and protects the system from becoming a tool for
   mass surveillance or "dragnet" analytics.25 7.3 Rights-Impacting AI
   Compliance (EO 14110) Consistent with OMB M-24-10, the IMMA Governance
   Board must annually certify that the system���s predictive models do not
   exhibit algorithmic bias against protected classes. Testing: AION runs
   counterfactual simulations ("If this applicant were of a different
   nationality or gender, would the Drift Score change?"). If bias is
   detected ($D_{bias} 0$), the model is automatically suspended by GATA
   PRIME until retrained. This ensures compliance with the Advancing Equity
   and Civil Rights provisions of EO 14110.26 8. Interagency Alignment: The
   Unified Constraint Field The ultimate failure of the current system is
   the lack of a shared reality. DHS sees "Aliens," DOJ sees "Respondents,"
   and HHS sees "Minors." To function effectively, the government must see
   "Entities" with a unified, truthful history. 8.1 The "Golden Record" via
   Syn IMMA mandates a single, shared definition of the entity, stored in
   the Proof Vault. Implementation: A "Federated Identity Broker" service.
   When a user is updated in DHS EID (e.g., an address change), the change
   propagates to EOIR���s case management system and HHS���s UAC portal via
   the GEM Bus (Global Event Message Bus).2 This ensures that all agencies
   are operating on the same version of the truth, eliminating the "blank
   address" problem where notices are sent to the wrong location. 8.2 The
   Joint Interagency Coordination Group (JIACG-I) To manage the human side
   of this alignment, the doctrine establishes a permanent JIACG-I
   co-chaired by the Deputy Secretaries of DHS, DOJ, and HHS. Role: This
   group serves as the GATA PRIME Authority. They hold the ultimate
   decision power over the "Constraint Weights" ($\lambda$) used by the AI
   agents. They decide, for example, whether the system should prioritize
   "Speed of Removal" or "Completeness of Due Process" in the algorithmic
   weighting.

AB This paper presents the Bayesian Adaptive Tactical Decision Support
   System designed to support operators in Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T)
   operations. The system integrates a situation assessment model that uses
   a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) for real-time situation prediction and
   awareness in a probabilistic manner, and a decision-making model that
   generates adaptive Courses of Action (COAs) based on probabilistic
   evaluations from the BNN. By leveraging Bayesian methods, the system can
   handle uncertainty and dynamic environments, providing operators with
   reliable decision support and actionable recommendations. The proposed
   approach enhances situational awareness and decision-making in complex,
   high-risk military operations. Simulation results demonstrate the
   system's effectiveness in improving mission planning and tactical
   responses. Future work will focus on scalability, real-world data
   integration, and further validation in diverse operational contexts.

AB Wearable biosensors represent an advanced solution for physiological and
   metabolic monitoring under extreme operational conditions. This review
   aimed to comparatively analyze the functionality, technological
   characteristics, and applicability of wearable biosensors used for
   nutritional and physiological monitoring in military and
   high-performance contexts. A total of 26 scientific articles (2015-2025)
   indexed in the Web of Science - Core Collection were included based on
   defined eligibility criteria. Data extraction focused on monitored
   parameters, transduction technologies, biosensor type, application
   context, and study design. Each device was assessed using a functional
   scoring system evaluating portability, accuracy, and operational
   utility. The results revealed high average scores for portability and
   field applicability, especially among electrophysiological and optical
   biosensors. However, most devices focused on cardiovascular,
   respiratory, and thermoregulatory monitoring, with limited integration
   of nutrition-specific biomarkers such as glucose, lactate, or salivary
   analytes. Only a few systems provided truly multimodal tracking. These
   findings emphasize a significant technological gap in the integration of
   comprehensive metabolic monitoring within wearable platforms. The
   analysis also highlights critical innovation priorities: development of
   autonomous, multisensory biosensors; enhanced energy autonomy; and
   increased data fusion capacity. In conclusion, wearable biosensors offer
   promising tools for strengthening physiological resilience, supporting
   preventive strategies, and improving real-time decision-making in
   military theaters. However, further innovation is needed to achieve
   robust, field-ready systems capable of holistic physiological and
   nutritional surveillance.

AB The effective Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
   Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems are crucial for modern
   military operations providing clear situational awareness and vital
   elements for decision-making. Various AI techniques have been already
   applied to enhance data integration and some other C4ISR components.
   This article proposes to explore the potential of Large Language Models
   (LLMs) to enhance the current C4ISR capacities such as analyzing vast
   amounts of data, translating languages, and generating diverse creative
   text formats that make them useful for heterogeneous data and
   information fusion, threats and fakes detection and analysis and
   decision support. After the introduction, the literature review
   discusses the technical considerations and potential benefits from the
   integration of LLMs into C4ISR systems. This discussion includes the
   functionalities such as multisource and multimodal data integration,
   detection, analysis and prediction of threats and misinformation,
   decision support through analysis of complex scenarios, identifying
   potential courses of action, and providing real-time recommendations to
   commanders working in evolving situations.
   The main challenges related to the use of today's LLMs to enhance C4ISR
   framework such as data security, model interpretability, and bias
   mitigation will be studied during this research. The specific challenges
   will be derived from the main case study. This article includes also
   some characteristics that may serve to elaborate the best-suited
   framework. This article ends by perspective for future work.

AB In recent years, the use of unmanned vehicles has advanced because of a
   growing number of civil applications such as firefighting or
   non-military security work, such as surveillance of pipelines etc. The
   application of these technologies with decreased cost and size has
   received attention in both civil and military applications. Recent
   advances in sensors, modeling and simulation and availability of
   open-source software and hardware for data integration has created an
   environment of remotely monitoring that was not possible a few years
   ago. This paper examines a niche cost-effective, portable Unmanned
   Surface Vessel that has been designed to capture the bathymetric profile
   of shallow water basins using single beam echosounder. Bathymetry is the
   measurement of the depth of water in oceans, rivers, or lakes.
   Bathymetric maps look a lot like topographic maps, which use lines to
   show the shape and elevation of land features. Today, echo sounders are
   used to make bathymetric measurements. Global shallow water bathymetry
   maps offer critical information to inform activities such as scientific
   research, environment protection, and marine transportation. Accurate
   mapping of shallow bathymetry is critical for understanding and
   characterizing coastal environments providing a foundation for measuring
   underwater light density, mapping and monitoring and planning marine
   operations and transportation. Methods for estimating shallow water
   bathymetry have suffered from a variety of trade-offs and limitations.
   Conventional methods such as shipborne sounding or airborne LiDAR have
   limited spatial coverage. The unit described in this paper has been
   designed and has been trained to acquire data in a predefined set path,
   minimizing the human intervention and the associated errors. A
   successful trial run was done for mapping the bed profile of the river
   basin in India. The vessel has been upskilled for capturing sonar data
   sets, with water quality parameters and soil samples using an automated
   auger. The vessel functions using the combined various open-source
   software and hardware tools for data assimilation, while the captured
   data sets are real- time transferred using IOT to Ground Controlled
   Station. The tropical river basin chosen is a part of Netravati River
   located in Dakshina Kannada District, Karnataka, India. This area is a
   part of the monsoon belt, and the Netravati riverbed is subjected to
   heavy sand deposition during a part of the year. The data on the
   excessive sand deposition is of immense value to the district and state
   administration. This study has been carried out at a frequency of 30
   days and is provided as an input during non- monsoon period for district
   administration for outlining removal of excessive sand deposition
   monitoring of water quality in the estuarine ecosystem. The work done is
   a one-of-a-kind pilot study developed in-house using the recent advances
   seen in the world of open-source platforms. This paper demonstrates a
   unique application that is of value to the state administration in
   decision making and in addition contributes to environmental monitoring
   of the riverbed

AB Abstract: Decision-making (DM) in critical environments is a complex
   process that can be simulated due to current telematic capabilities,
   which allow real-time interaction with large amounts of data. This
   document describes the proposed architecture from a research project
   conducted by the Colombian Air Force (FAC) Aerospace Technology
   Development Center for Defense (CETAD). Using computerized and expert
   system tools, such architecture allows creating a real-time computer
   environment for the decision-maker to evaluate their options and prepare
   for real events, simulating characteristics, resources, and strategies.
   This paper describes a research product that resulted in a simulation
   system, based on a combination of fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and
   decision trees. These contribute to modeling and simulating various
   entities and their automatic response according to simulated patterns
   and situations. Then, using operators, the decision-maker can modify
   entity behavior within parameterized restrictions and physical
   conditions. Also, based on business intelligence tools, reports are
   generated to evaluate the decisions made. This type of technology
   improves planning capacity and facilitates the decision-making process.
   The system allows simulating any media deployment in the context of
   national security and critical events. Thus, a case study is developed
   for implementing a support-oriented simulation in a natural disaster
   scenario.
X4 Resumen: El proceso de toma de decisiones (TD) en entornos críticos es
   un proceso complejo que puede ser simulado gracias a las capacidades
   telemáticas actuales, que permiten interactuar con grandes cantidades de
   datos en tiempo real. Este documento describe la arquitectura planteada
   desde un proceso de investigación, desarrollado del Centro de Desarrollo
   de Tecnología Aeroespacial de la FAC (CETAD), que permitió utilizando
   herramientas computarizadas, basados en conocimiento experto, crear un
   entorno en el que el decisor evalué sus opciones preparándose para
   eventos reales, simulando las características del proceso de TD en
   tiempo, recursos y estrategias en un entorno en tiempo real. Este
   documento describe el producto de una investigación que dio como
   resultado un sistema de simulación con una arquitectura basada que
   combina lógica difusa, algoritmos genéticos y árboles de decisiones con
   los que se puede modelar diversas entidades y su respuesta automática de
   acuerdo a los patrones y situaciones simuladas, en la que a través de
   operadores el decisor puede modificar las instrucciones para las
   entidades dentro de unas restricciones parametrizadas que obedecen a
   condiciones físicas. También basado en técnicas de inteligencia de
   negocios, se generan informes para evaluar las decisiones tomadas. Este
   tipo de tecnologías mejora la capacidad de planificación y facilitar el
   proceso de toma de decisiones. Este sistema permite simular cualquier
   despliegue de medios en el contexto de la seguridad nacional y eventos
   críticos. Así, se desarrolló un estudio de caso para la implementación
   de una simulación orientada al soporte en el escenario de un desastre
   natural.

AB Real-time detection of acute changes in neurophysiological state, such
   as epileptic seizures, lapses in cognitive ability, acute stress, etc.,
   can ultimately serve to prevent accidents in high-risk occupations that
   require unwavering focus. Such professions include hazardous cargo
   trucking, heavy machinery operation, security and defense, air traffic
   control, etc. Indeed, technology for acquiring rich biosensor data
   streams that capture brain function, e.g., electroencephalography, are
   becoming increasingly portable and noninvasive. These developments
   present an opportunity for implementing not only real-time monitoring,
   but also providing pre-emptive alerts (e.g., smart phone displays),
   which can be used to indicate degradation in physiological states. This
   research has direct applications in biomedical settings - for instance,
   epilepsy, is one of the most common neurological disorders afflicting
   over 50 million people worldwide, including 3 million people in the U.S.
   In about 25 percent of these patients, epileptic seizures are not
   controlled using available medications. Being able to detect (or
   predict) the onset of epileptic seizures would significantly enhance the
   patient's quality of life. In a proof-of-concept study, the novel
   analytical approaches by the research team detected the onset of
   epileptic seizures within 2.5 seconds. In contrast, existing approaches
   have a detection delay exceeding 7 seconds. From a broader perspective,
   the findings of this research can transform the status quo in real-time
   monitoring of neurophysiological function. The multidisciplinary
   research team will strive to provide state-of-the-art research and
   training opportunities for a diverse group of students that bridges the
   gap from engineering to the life and brain sciences. <br/><br/>The
   research team will develop a sensor data fusion approach based on graph
   theoretic topological mapping to combine data acquired from multiple
   biosensors for neurophysiological change point detection. Unlike
   existing approaches, which rely on complex signal pre-processing, the
   graph theoretic approach eschews these computationally demanding steps
   and is therefore more viable in a practical setting. The research team
   will exploit this framework using a data library of high-resolution
   neurophysiological recordings acquired from end users in realistic
   settings that induce shifts in global functional states (e.g., acute
   stress, cognitive exhaustion, and fatigue and so on). The research team
   will integrate automated decision-making approaches in the overall
   schema to synthesize the information and provide easily interpretable
   feedback to the end user (e.g., displays on a smart device).
   Furthermore, the PIs will customize biosensors to accommodate the
   patient's lifestyle.

AB Autonomous intelligent systems will find important applications in our
   future society. Initial applications will be in the following areas:
   surveillance, intelligence gathering and operational control in the
   areas of disaster mitigation (earthquake, nuclear catastrophe, military
   combat, oil-spills at sea, transport infrastructure breakdown, analysis
   and assistance with terrorist attacks), space exploration at remote
   locations (at Trojan asteroids, on Mars and in orbit observations around
   planets, deep underwater explorations and robotics for offshore oil
   exploration disasters) followed by large scale applications such as
   agricultural, search and rescue, manufacturing, and autonomous household
   robots. These autonomous system will require quick, appropriate, and at
   the same time informative-to-partners, actions by teams of robots. They
   can also be computing network based intelligent agents with sensing and
   control capabilities. It will be a societal requirement that these
   (semi-)autonomously operating systems to inform their human supervisors
   about the reasoning behind their actions and their future plans in
   concise notes for their safety and acceptability by society.  Network
   based software agents have been in use by our society for some time. Our
   society is going through information exchange revolution that is
   developing towards networked intelligent devices. Many of these
   infrastructure systems are based on well defined discrete inputs and
   outputs either from human operators or from low dimensional sensor
   measurements. Little progress has however been made in robot
   intelligence of autonomy where high complexity, changing environment is
   to be sensed, reasoned about and acted upon quickly. Partial results
   have been reported in DARPA, Robocup projects that do not provide
   comprehensive systematic approach or are not fully publicly available.
   Progress has only been made in heavily infrastructured environments of
   robots.   We do not yet have the methodology for a set of autonomous
   vehicles or agent systems to operate reliably and (semi-)autonomously in
   complex infrastructure-free environments to solve problems efficiently
   with minimal human supervision. The reason is that current intelligent
   agent technology does not provide solutions. Sensor networks with simple
   computational nodes, that were developed for low power and computational
   resources do not provide solutions. They miss the ability of high
   complexity conceptual abstractions onboard a single agent. The
   computations of these type of agents cannot be substituted by data
   fusion of low complexity agents due to typical real-time and
   communication bottlenecks. Methods of multi-agent decentralized decision
   theory have been developed and very successfully used prior to this
   project but have not been properly exploited for multiple complex
   agents.  This project intends to develop a new methodology for
   autonomous cooperating multi-agent systems that is to boost the
   technological capabilities of our partner companies and the robotics
   industry in general. The project will provide the missing capabilities
   of abstractions concerning world modeling, situational awareness,
   learning and information management onboard a single agent. These
   capabilities will enable efficient realtime decision making within
   multi-agent cooperation and decentralized decision making in poorly
   structured or infrastructure free environments. These methods will
   connect digital computing power with human conceptual structures to
   enable robots to model the world with layers of high and low level
   concepts as humans do.
