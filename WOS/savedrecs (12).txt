AB As the Internet grows, cybersecurity problems also arise. Different
   types of malicious activities have been explored by attackers. However,
   the existent defense mechanisms are not able to completely end the
   malicious threats, perpetuating this continuous arms race. The
   development of applications to mitigate those threats presents some
   complicating factors such as the growth in the amount of data, and the
   variety of data, that can come from different sources. In this paper we
   present an architecture built on top of Big Data frameworks that aims to
   mitigate cybersecurity problems such as spam and phishing and we show
   how it is being used to study spam and phishing collected using a global
   honeynet.

AB Internet, big data, global society, economy, life, politics, military,
   and culture are deeply integrated and have developed into an era of
   overlapping cyberspace and real society. Cyberspace security has become
   the most complex, comprehensive, and severe non-traditional security
   challenge facing all countries in the world. However, the talents in the
   field of cyberspace security cannot meet the practical needs of the
   development of cyberspace security. This paper puts forward the training
   scheme of network security talents, discusses the relationship between
   knowledge atlas and network space security, gives the construction and
   distribution of network space full knowledge atlas, and then constructs
   an education big data architecture for cyberspace security based on
   knowledge graph around the use of knowledge.

AB Although artificial intelligence has become part of everyone's real
   life, a trust crisis against such systems is occurring, thus increasing
   the need to explain black-box predictions, especially in the military,
   medical, and financial domains. Modern eXplainable Artificial
   Intelligence (XAI) techniques focus on benchmark datasets, but the
   cognitive applicability of such solutions under big data settings is
   still unclear due to memory or computation constraints. In this paper,
   we extend a model-agnostic XAI methodology, named Cluster-Aided Space
   Transformation for Local Explanation (CASTLE), to be able to deal with
   high-volume datasets. CASTLE aims to explain the black-box behavior of
   predictive models by combining both local (i.e., based on the input
   sample) and global (i.e., based on the whole scope for action of the
   model) information. In particular, the local explanation provides a
   rule-based explanation for the prediction of a target instance as well
   as the directions to update the likelihood of the predicted class. Our
   extension leverages modern big data technologies (e.g., Apache Spark) to
   handle the high volume, variety, and velocity of huge datasets. We have
   evaluated the framework on five datasets, in terms of temporal
   efficiency, explanation quality, and model significance. Our results
   indicate that the proposed approach retains the high-quality
   explanations associated with CASTLE while efficiently handling large
   datasets. Importantly, it exhibits a sub-linear, rather than
   exponential, dependence on dataset size, making it a scalable solution
   for massive datasets or in any big data scenario.

AB Snort is a well-known, signature-based network intrusion detection
   system (NIDS). The Snort sensor must be placed within the same physical
   network, and the defense centers in the typical NIDS architecture offer
   limited network coverage, especially for remote networks with a
   restricted bandwidth and network policy. Additionally, the growing
   number of sensor instances, followed by a quick increase in log data
   volume, has caused the present system to face big data challenges. This
   research paper proposes a novel design for a cloud-based Snort NIDS
   using containers and implementing big data in the defense center to
   overcome these problems. Our design consists of Docker as the sensor's
   platform, Apache Kafka, as the distributed messaging system, and big
   data technology orchestrated on lambda architecture. We conducted
   experiments to measure sensor deployment, optimum message delivery from
   the sensors to the defense center, aggregation speed, and efficiency in
   the data-processing performance of the defense center. We successfully
   developed a cloud-based Snort NIDS and found the optimum method for
   message-delivery from the sensor to the defense center. We also
   succeeded in developing the dashboard and attack maps to display the
   attack statistics and visualize the attacks. Our first design is
   reported to implement the big data architecture, namely, lambda
   architecture, as the defense center and utilize rapid deployment of
   Snort NIDS using Docker technology as the network security monitoring
   platform.

AB Background: The COVID-19 outbreak required prompt action by health
   authorities around the world in response to a novel threat. With
   enormous amounts of information originating in sources with uncertain
   degree of validation and accuracy, it is essential to provide
   executive-level decision-makers with the most actionable, pertinent, and
   updated data analysis to enable them to adapt their strategy swiftly and
   competently.
   Objective: We report here the origination of a COVID-19 dedicated
   response in the Israel Defense Forces with the assembly of an
   operational Data Center for the Campaign against Coronavirus.
   Methods: Spearheaded by directors with clinical, operational, and data
   analytics orientation, a multidisciplinary team utilized existing and
   newly developed platforms to collect and analyze large amounts of
   information on an individual level in the context of SARS-CoV-2
   contraction and infection.
   Results: Nearly 300,000 responses to daily questionnaires were recorded
   and were merged with other data sets to form a unified data lake. By
   using basic as well as advanced analytic tools ranging from simple
   aggregation and display of trends to data science application, we
   provided commanders and clinicians with access to trusted, accurate, and
   personalized information and tools that were designed to foster
   operational changes and mitigate the propagation of the pandemic. The
   developed tools aided in the in the identification of high-risk
   individuals for severe disease and resulted in a 30% decline in their
   attendance to their units. Moreover, the queue for laboratory
   examination for COVID-19 was optimized using a predictive model and
   resulted in a high true-positive rate of 20%, which is more than twice
   as high as the baseline rate (2.28%, 95% CI 1.63%-3.19%).
   Conclusions: In times of ambiguity and uncertainty, along with an
   unprecedented flux of information, health organizations may find
   multidisciplinary teams working to provide intelligence from diverse and
   rich data a key factor in providing executives relevant and actionable
   support for decision-making.

AB We have designed a real-world smart building energy fault detection
   (SBFD) system on a cloud-based Databricks workspace, a high-performance
   computing (HPC) environment for big-data-intensive applications powered
   by Apache Spark. By avoiding a Smart Building Diagnostics as a Service
   approach and keeping a tightly centralized design, the rapid development
   and deployment of the cloud-based SBFD system was achieved within one
   calendar year. Thanks to Databricks' built-in scheduling interface, a
   continuous pipeline of real-time ingestion, integration, cleaning, and
   analytics workflows capable of energy consumption prediction and anomaly
   detection was implemented and deployed in the cloud. The system
   currently provides fault detection in the form of predictions and
   anomaly detection for 96 buildings on an active military installation.
   The system's various jobs all converge within 14 min on average. It
   facilitates the seamless interaction between our workspace and a cloud
   data lake storage provided for secure and automated initial ingestion of
   raw data provided by a third party via the Secure File Transfer Protocol
   (SFTP) and BLOB (Binary Large Objects) file system secure protocol
   drivers. With a powerful Python binding to the Apache Spark distributed
   computing framework, PySpark, these actions were coded into
   collaborative notebooks and chained into the aforementioned pipeline.
   The pipeline was successfully managed and configured throughout the
   lifetime of the project and is continuing to meet our needs in
   deployment. In this paper, we outline the general architecture and how
   it differs from previous smart building diagnostics initiatives, present
   details surrounding the underlying technology stack of our data
   pipeline, and enumerate some of the necessary configuration steps
   required to maintain and develop this big data analytics application in
   the cloud.

   will be cross-level,                cross-network, cross-domain
   transmission in a data                transmission under condition of
   ensuring absolute                safety of data through three different
   personnel                system administrators, audit administrators. A 
   national security channel is established between                two
   local security password services for data                synchronization
   after three ultra-administrators                stored by the security
   administrator are                authenticated, where the data in the   
   synchronization process does not fall to a ground.               
   Message abstract of plaintext data is obtained by                MD5,
   SHAor SM3using national secret                algorithm.
   USE - Method for performing data encryption and               
   decryption based on data classification in data                security
   field. Can also be used in cloud, Internet                of things and
   artificial intelligence fields.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables enhancing the security of               
   data in storage and transmission, the key is                managed by
   the system, so as to avoid the                possibility of human key
   leakage. The method                enables classifying and grading the
   data, and                safely storing and safely transmitting the data
   in                various forms, such as data center, big data and      
            data lake.

AB With the promotion of the national transportation power strategy, super
   large operation networks have become an inevitable trend, and
   operational safety and risk management and control have become
   unavoidable problems. Existing safety management methods lack support
   from actual operational and production data, resulting in a lack of
   guidance of fault cause modes and risk chains. Large space is available
   to improve the breadth, depth, and accuracy of hazard source control. By
   mining multisource heterogeneous operation big data generated from
   subway operation, this study researches operation risk chain and refined
   management and control of key hidden dangers. First, it builds a data
   pool based on the operation status of several cities and then links them
   into a data lake to form an integrated data warehouse to find coupled
   and interactive rail transit operation risk chains. Second, it reveals
   and analyzes the risk correlation mechanisms behind the data and refines
   the key hazards in the risk chain. Finally, under the guidance of the
   risk chain, it deeply studies the technologies for refined control and
   governance of key hidden dangers. The results can truly transform rail
   transit operation safety from passive response to active defense,
   improving the special emergency rail transit operation plans, improving
   the current situation of low utilization of rail transit operation data,
   but high operation failure rate, and providing a basis for
   evidence-based formulation and revision of relevant industry standards
   and specifications.
