AB Given the recent advances in remote sensing analytics, cloud computing,
   and machine learning, it is imperative to evaluate capabilities of
   remote sensing for water quality monitoring in the context of water
   resources management and decision-making. The objectives of this review
   were to analyze recent advances in water quality remote sensing and
   determine limitations of current systems, estimation methods, and
   suggest future improvements. To that end, we collected over 200 sets of
   water quality data including blue-green algae phycocyanin (BGA-PC),
   chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductivity
   (SC), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), turbidity, and
   pollution-sediments from 2016 to 2018. The water quality data, generated
   from laboratory analysis of grab samples and in situ real-time
   monitoring sensors distributed in eight lakes and rivers in Midwestern
   United States, were paired with synchronous proximal spectra,
   tripod-mounted hyperspectral imagery, and satellite data. The results
   showed that both proximal and satellite-based sensors have great
   potential to provide accurate estimate of optically active parameters,
   and remote sensing of non-optically active parameters may be indirectly
   estimated but still remains a challenge. Data-driven empirical
   approaches, i.e., deep learning outperformed the other competing
   methods, providing promising possibility for operational use of remote
   sensing in water quality monitoring and decision-making. As the
   first-time review of deep neural networks for water quality estimation,
   the paper concludes that anomaly detection utilizing multi-sensor data
   fusion and virtual constellation in cloud-computing is the most
   promising means for predicting impending water pollution outbreaks such
   as algal blooms.

AB The rapid development of Internet of things (IoT) technology makes it
   possible for connecting various smart objects together through the
   Internet and providing more data interoperability methods for
   application purpose. Recent research shows more potential applications
   of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare
   services. However, the diversity of the objects in IoT causes the
   heterogeneity problem of the data format in IoT platform. Meanwhile, the
   use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of
   real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more
   difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model
   is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data
   accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data
   ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources.
   Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services
   to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data
   flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The
   result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is
   effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting
   data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing
   platform.

AB Enormous amounts of data are being produced everyday by sub-meters and
   smart sensors installed in residential buildings. If leveraged properly,
   that data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies
   in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of
   each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem
   becoming overwhelming. Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making
   to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficient
   behavior. In this regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing
   anomaly detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on
   artificial intelligence. Specifically, an extensive survey is presented,
   in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify existing
   algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted, such as
   machine learning algorithms, feature extraction approaches, anomaly
   detection levels, computing platforms and application scenarios. To the
   best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review article that
   discusses anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving
   forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems,
   difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly
   discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of
   anomalous power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified
   metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, (iv) platforms
   for reproducibility and (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights
   about current research trends are discussed to widen the applications
   and effectiveness of the anomaly detection technology before deriving
   future directions attracting significant attention. This article serves
   as a comprehensive reference to understand the current technological
   progress in anomaly detection of energy consumption based on artificial
   intelligence.

AB Radar and camera information fusion sensing methods are used to solve
   the inherent shortcomings of the single sensor in severe weather. Our
   fusion scheme uses radar as the main hardware and camera as the
   auxiliary hardware framework. At the same time, the Mahalanobis distance
   is used to match the observed values of the target sequence. Data fusion
   based on the joint probability function method. Moreover, the algorithm
   was tested using actual sensor data collected from a vehicle, performing
   real-time environment perception. The test results show that radar and
   camera fusion algorithms perform better than single sensor environmental
   perception in severe weather, which can effectively reduce the missed
   detection rate of autonomous vehicle environment perception in severe
   weather. The fusion algorithm improves the robustness of the environment
   perception system and provides accurate environment perception
   information for the decision-making system and control system of
   autonomous vehicles.

AB The construction industry is facing enormous pressure to adopt digital
   solutions to solve the industry's inherent problems. The digital twin
   has emerged as a solution that can update a BIM model with real-time
   data to achieve cyber-physical integration, enabling real-time
   monitoring of assets and activities and improving decisionmaking. The
   application of digital twins in the construction industry is still in
   its nascent stages but has been steadily growing over the past few
   years. A wide variety of emerging technologies are being used in the
   development of digital twins in diverse applications in construction but
   it is not immediately clear from the literature which ones are key to
   the successful development of digital twins, necessitating a systematic
   literature review with a focus on technologies. This paper aims to
   identify the key technologies used in the development of digital twins
   in construction in the existing literature, the research gaps and the
   potential areas for future research. This is achieved by conducting a
   systematic review of studies with demonstrative case studies and
   experimental setups in construction. Based on the observed research
   gaps, prominent future research directions are suggested, focusing on
   technologies in data transmission, interoperability and data integration
   and data processing and visualisation.

AB While wearable and mobile chemical sensors have experienced tremendous
   growth over the past decade, their potential for tracking and guiding
   nutrition has emerged only over the past three years. Currently,
   guidelines from doctors and dietitians represent the most common
   approach for maintaining optimal nutrition status. However, such
   recommendations rely on population averages and do not take into account
   individual variability in responding to nutrients. Precision nutrition
   has recently emerged to address the large heterogeneity in individuals'
   responses to diet, by tailoring nutrition based on the specific
   requirements of each person. It aims at preventing and managing diseases
   by formulating personalized dietary interventions to individuals on the
   basis of their metabolic profile, background, and environmental
   exposure. Recent advances in digital nutrition technology, including
   caloriescounting mobile apps and wearable motion tracking devices, lack
   the ability of monitoring nutrition at the molecular level. The
   realization of effective precision nutrition requires synergy from
   different sensor modalities in order to make timely reliable predictions
   and efficient feedback. This work reviews key opportunities and
   challenges toward the successful realization of effective wearable and
   mobile nutrition monitoring platforms. Non-invasive wearable and mobile
   electrochemical sensors, capable of monitoring temporal chemical
   variations upon the intake of food and supplements, are excellent
   candidates to bridge the gap between digital and biochemical analyses
   for a successful personalized nutrition approach. By providing timely
   (previously unavailable) dietary information, such wearable and mobile
   sensors offer the guidance necessary for supporting dietary behavior
   change toward a managed nutritional balance. Coupling of the rapidly
   emerging wearable chemical sensing devices.generating enormous dynamic
   analytical data.with efficient data-fusion and data-mining methods that
   identify patterns and make predictions is expected to revolutionize
   dietary decision-making toward effective precision nutrition.

AB Considerable progress has been made in improving the estimation accuracy
   of cognitive workload using various sensor technologies. However, the
   overall performance of different algorithms and methods remain
   suboptimal in real-world applications. Some studies in the literature
   demonstrate that a single modality is sufficient to estimate cognitive
   workload. These studies are limited to controlled settings, a scenario
   that is significantly different from the real world where data gets
   corrupted, interrupted, and delayed. In such situations, the use of
   multiple modalities is needed. Multimodal fusion approaches have been
   successful in other domains, such as wireless-sensor networks, in
   addressing single-sensor weaknesses and improving information
   quality/accuracy. These approaches are inherently more reliable when a
   data source is lost. In the cognitive workload literature, sensors, such
   as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and eye
   tracking, have shown success in estimating the aspects of cognitive
   workload. Multimodal approaches that combine data from several sensors
   together can be more robust for real-time measurement of cognitive
   workload. In this article, we review the published studies related to
   multimodal data fusion to estimate the cognitive workload and synthesize
   their main findings. We identify the opportunities for designing better
   multimodal fusion systems for cognitive workload modeling.

AB Globally, the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) industry has
   seen a rise in the adoption of digital twin (DT) technologies due to
   their potential to enhance collaboration and information communication
   throughout the project lifecycle from the design to operation and
   maintenance (O & M) phase. However, empirical evidence on such adoption
   is fragmented, particularly for facility management (FM) activities
   during the O & M phase. Considering this gap, an illustrative case study
   approach is performed to analyze and compare the traditional practices
   of FM with DT-driven FM during the O & M phase using four geospatially
   representative cases. The findings show that DT technologies enable
   efficient and responsive planning and control of FM activities by
   providing real-time status of the building assets. However, barriers
   such as the misalignment of the data integration and data standards
   hamper their future implementation. To address this, a bottom-up
   conceptual framework is proposed to facilitate a wider implementation of
   DT technologies and support FM during the O & M phase of buildings. As
   such, this paper's contribution is twofold: (1) it provides an aggregate
   landscape of DT application to manage facilities during the O & M phase,
   and (2) it develops an evidence-induced conceptual framework for
   stakeholders who are grappling with their FM decision-making processes.

AB Despite the many existing best practices in safety, the construction
   industry lacks automated safety monitoring and analysis of task-level
   construction operations. Data to workforce, equipment, and the overall
   site safety performance are currently observed, measured, and evaluated
   almost always manually. Such resulting performance information is likely
   assessed infrequently and due to subjective human interpretation or
   error. Research in lagging and leading safety indicators shows further
   that safety knowledge is hardly ever shared among relevant project
   stakeholders in time to prevent accidents. Since a large number of all
   construction fatalities are related to struck-by events - for example,
   workers-on-foot being too close to construction equipment and to other
   restricted or geo-referenced hazard areas - a novel framework around
   real-time location tracking technology was designed and tested to
   collect and study near miss data. The objectives of this article are to
   automatically identify the areas of static and dynamic hazards on a
   construction site and to automatically gather and analyze the
   spatial-temporal conflicts between workers-on-foot and the identified
   hazards. Automated conversion of raw sensor location data collected to
   the operation of workers, equipment, and geo-referenced hazard areas
   into meaningful proximity-related safety information is introduced.
   Field experiments validate the research based on an a priori created
   safe site layout information model. Results are in particular useful for
   practitioners or researchers who would like to enhance their
   quantitative and visual understanding of operational construction
   resource activity monitoring and analysis, and in the specific domain of
   detecting and mapping spatial-temporal proximity relationships of near
   miss events. Applications of the resulting knowledge are explained in
   the context of empowering construction safety engineers, managers, and
   the workforce by enhancing decision making in safe site layout design
   and planning and providing additional interactive tools in safety
   education and training. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As urbanization process has been and will be happening in an
   unprecedented scale worldwide, strong requirements from academic
   research and practical fields for smart management and intelligent
   planning of cities are pressing to handle increasing demands of
   infrastructure and potential risks of inhabitants' agglomeration in
   disaster management. Geospatial data and geographic information systems
   (GISs) are essential components for building smart cities in a basic way
   that maps the physical world into virtual environment as a referencing
   framework. On higher level, GIS has been becoming very important in
   smart cities on different sectors. In the digital city era, digital maps
   and geospatial databases have long been integrated in workflows in land
   management, urban planning and transportation in government. People have
   anticipated GIS to be more powerful not only as an archival and data
   management tool but also as spatial models for supporting
   decision-making in intelligent cities. Successful applications have been
   developed in private and public organizations by using GIS as a platform
   for data integration, a system for geospatial analysis and collection of
   models for visualization and decision-making. Location-based services on
   smart mobile devices in ubiquitous telecommunication networks are now an
   indispensable function that expands knowledge of the nature and
   connections among people. On data side, crowd-sourcing, real-time urban
   sensing and true 3-dimensional (3D) models and visualization have
   provided more advantages of GIS to final users and at the same time
   challenged current available solutions and technologies of data
   handling, visualization and human-computer interaction. On the
   technological side, Web 2.0 participatory applications provide the
   framework and environment for GIS to closer link to photogrammetry and
   computer vision, which empowers smart devices more capabilities. How to
   manage big geo-tagged data volumes collected by numerous sensors and
   implement professional GIS functions in a cloud computing environment
   are urgent questions to facilitate smart cities management. This paper

AB Real-time, accurate, and robust localisation is critical for autonomous
   vehicles (AVs) to achieve safe, efficient driving, whilst real-time
   performance is essential for AVs to achieve their current position in
   time for decision making. To date, no review paper has quantitatively
   compared the realtime performance between different localisation
   techniques based on various hardware platforms and programming languages
   and analysed the relations among localisation methodologies, real-time
   performance and accuracy. Therefore, this paper discusses the
   state-of-the-art localisation techniques and analyses their overall
   performance in AV application. For further analysis, this paper firstly
   proposes a localisation algorithm operations capability (LAOC)-based
   equivalent comparison method to compare the relative computational
   complexity of different localisation techniques; then, it
   comprehensively discusses the relations among methodologies,
   computational complexity, and accuracy. Analysis results show that the
   computational complexity of localisation approaches differs by a maximum
   of about 107 times, whilst accuracy varies by about 100 times. Vision-
   and data fusion- based localisation techniques have about 2-5 times
   potential for improving accuracy compared with lidar-based localisation.
   Lidar- and vision-based localisation can reduce computational complexity
   by improving image registration method efficiency. Data fusion-based
   localisation can achieve better realtime performance compared with
   lidar- and vision-based localisation because each standalone sensor does
   not need to develop a complex algorithm to achieve its best localisation
   potential. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology can improve
   positioning robustness. Finally, the potential solutions and future
   orientations of AVs' localisation based on the quantitative comparison
   results are discussed.

AB In the past few years, wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs) emerged as
   a low-cost solution for healthcare applications. In WBSNs, biosensors
   collect periodically physiological measurement and send them to the
   coordinator where the data fusion process takes place. However,
   processing the huge amount of data captured by the limited lifetime
   biosensors and taking the right decisions when there is an emergency are
   major challenges in WBSNs. In this paper, we introduce a biosensor data
   management framework, starting from data collection to decision making.
   First, we propose an adaptive data collection approach on the biosensor
   node level. This approach uses an early warning score system to optimize
   data transmission and estimates in real time the sensing frequency.
   Second, we present a data fusionmodel on the coordinator level using a
   decision matrix and fuzzy set theory. To evaluate our approach, we
   conducted multiple series of simulations on real sensor data. The
   results show that our approach reduces the amount of collected data,
   while maintaining data integrity. In addition, we show the impact of
   sampling and filtering data on the accuracy of the taken decisions and
   compare our data fusion approach with a basic decision tree algorithm.

AB Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) presents unparalleled opportunities
   for fabricating complex, highperformance structures and components with
   unique material properties. Despite these advancements, achieving
   consistent part quality and process repeatability remains challenging.
   This paper provides a comprehensive review of various state-of-the-art
   in-situ process monitoring techniques, including optical-based
   monitoring, acoustic-based sensing, laser line scanning, and operando
   X-ray monitoring. These techniques are evaluated for their capabilities
   and limitations in detecting defects within Laser Powder Bed Fusion
   (LPBF) and Laser Directed Energy Deposition (LDED) processes.
   Furthermore, the review discusses emerging multisensor monitoring and
   machine learning (ML)-assisted defect detection methods, benchmarking ML
   models tailored for in-situ defect detection. The paper also discusses
   in-situ adaptive defect remediation strategies that advance LAM towards
   zero-defect autonomous operations, focusing on real-time closed-loop
   feedback control and defect correction methods. Research gaps such as
   the need for standardization, improved reliability and sensitivity, and
   decision-making strategies beyond early stopping are highlighted. Future
   directions are proposed, with an emphasis on multimodal sensor fusion
   for multiscale defect prediction and fault diagnosis, ultimately
   enabling self-adaptation in LAM processes. This paper aims to equip
   researchers and industry professionals with a holistic understanding of
   the current capabilities, limitations, and future directions in in-situ
   process monitoring and adaptive quality enhancement in LAM.

AB Wearable health-monitoring systems (WHMSs) represent the new generation
   of healthcare by providing real-time unobtrusive monitoring of patients'
   physiological parameters through the deployment of several on-body and
   even intra-body biosensors. Although several technological issues
   regarding WHMS still need to be resolved in order to become more
   applicable in real-life scenarios, it is expected that continuous
   ambulatory monitoring of vital signs will enable proactive personal
   health management and better treatment of patients suffering from
   chronic diseases, of the elderly population, and of emergency
   situations. In this paper, we present a physiological data fusion model
   for multisensor WHMS called Prognosis. The proposed methodology is based
   on a fuzzy regular language for the generation of the prognoses of the
   health conditions of the patient, whereby the current state of the
   corresponding fuzzy finite-state machine signifies the current estimated
   health state and context of the patient. The operation of the proposed
   scheme is explained via detailed examples in hypothetical scenarios.
   Finally, a stochastic Petri net model of the human-device interaction is
   presented, which illustrates how additional health status feedback can
   be obtained from the WHMS' user.

AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) interconnects a large number of
   interconnected sensors, actuators, and edge computing devices in the
   manufacturing systems, where the massive data collected in the
   manufacturing process has the characteristics of multi-dimensional,
   heterogeneous, and time series. An effective data representation manner,
   which can fuse such complex information and enable cognitive
   manufacturing decision making from a global perspective, is necessary
   and challenging. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a knowledge
   graph-based data representation approach for IIoT-enabled cognitive
   manufacturing and applies it in a Cyber-Physical Production System
   (CPPS) scenario. Based on the digital thread of manufacturing process
   data, a multi-layer manufacturing knowledge graph is established,
   including device sensing data, production processing data, and business
   processing data. With the established knowledge graph, a
   cognition-driven approach is proposed with a perception-cognition dual
   system, which achieves perception analysis and cognition decision making
   in the resource allocation of the manufacturing process. Finally,
   responding to the orders of personalized products in a workshop is taken
   as an illustrative example. The performance of allocating resources of
   workshop devices under dynamic demand changes shows the advantages of
   the proposed approach. The proposed manner will lay the foundation for a
   human-like cognition for processing massive real-time industrial
   information in CPPS, thus paving a pathway towards the era of cognitive
   manufacturing.

AB Numerous buildings fall short of expectations regarding occupant
   satisfaction, sustainability, or energy efficiency. In this paper, the
   performance of buildings in terms of occupant comfort is evaluated using
   a probabilistic model based on Bayesian networks (BNs). The BN model is
   founded on an in-depth anal-ysis of satisfaction survey responses and a
   thorough study of building performance parameters. This study also
   presents a user-friendly visualization compatible with BIM to simplify
   data collecting in two case studies from Norway with data from 2019 to
   2022. This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin approach for
   incorporating building information modeling (BIM) with real-time sensor
   data, occupants' feedback, a probabilistic model of occupants' comfort,
   and HVAC faults detection and prediction that may affect occupants'
   comfort. New methods for using BIM as a visualization platform, as well
   as a pre-dictive maintenance method to detect and anticipate problems in
   the HVAC system, are also presented. These methods will help
   decision-makers improve the occupants' comfort conditions in buildings.
   However, due to the intricate interaction between numerous equipment and
   the absence of data integra-tion among FM systems, CMMS, BMS, and BIM
   data are integrated in this paper into a framework utilizing ontology
   graphs to generalize the Digital Twin framework so it can be applied to
   many buildings. The results of this study can aid decision-makers in the
   facility management sector by offering insight into the aspects that
   influence occupant comfort, speeding up the process of identifying
   equipment malfunc-tions, and pointing toward possible solutions.(c) 2022

AB We are developing a real-time, data-integrated, data-driven, continuous
   decision-making engine, The Dairy Brain, by applying precision farming,
   big data analytics, and the Internet of Things. This is a
   transdisciplinary research and extension project that engages
   multidisciplinary scientists, dairy farmers, and industry professionals.
   Dairy farms have embraced large and diverse technological innovations
   such as sensors and robotic systems, and procured vast amounts of
   constant data streams, but they have not been able to integrate all this
   information effectively to improve whole-farm decision making.
   Consequently, the effects of all this new smart dairy farming are not
   being fully realized. It is imperative to develop a system that can
   collect, integrate, manage, and analyze on- and off-farm data in real
   time for practical and relevant actions. We are using the
   state-of-the-art database management system from the University of
   Wisconsin-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing to develop our
   Agricultural Data Hub that connects and analyzes cow and herd data on a
   permanent basis. This involves cleaning and normalizing the data as well
   as allowing data retrieval on demand. We illustrate our Dairy Brain
   concept with 3 practical applications: (1) nutritional grouping that
   provides a more accurate diet to lactating cows by automatically
   allocating cows to pens according to their nutritional requirements
   aggregating and analyzing data streams from management, feed, Dairy Herd
   Improvement (DHI), and milking parlor records; (2) early risk detection
   of clinical mastitis (CM) that identifies first-lactation cows under
   risk of developing CM by analyzing integrated data from genetic,
   management, and DHI records; and (3) predicting CM onset that recognizes
   cows at higher risk of contracting CM, by continuously integrating and
   analyzing data from management and the milking parlor. We demonstrate
   with these applications that it is possible to develop integrated
   continuous decision-support tools that could potentially reduce diet
   costs by $99/cow per yr and that it is possible to provide a new
   dimension for monitoring health events by identifying cows at higher
   risk of CM and by detecting 90% of CM cases a few milkings before
   disease onset. We are securely advancing toward our overarching goal of
   developing our Dairy Brain. This is an ongoing innovative project that
   is anticipated to transform how dairy farms operate.

   methodologies and algorithms, highlighting their practical applications
   in the critical domain of water resource management. Environmental
   issues, such as climate change and ecosystem destruction, pose
   significant threats to humanity and the planet. Addressing these
   challenges necessitates sustainable resource management and increased
   efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ML technologies present
   promising solutions in this regard. By harnessing AI and ML, we can
   collect and analyze vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as
   remote sensing, smart sensors, and social media. This enables real-time
   monitoring and decision making in water resource management. AI
   applications, including irrigation optimization, water quality
   monitoring, flood forecasting, and water demand forecasting, enhance
   agricultural practices, water distribution models, and decision making
   in desalination plants. Furthermore, AI facilitates data integration,
   supports decision-making processes, and enhances overall water
   management sustainability. However, the wider adoption of AI in water
   resource management faces challenges, such as data heterogeneity,
   stakeholder education, and high costs. To provide an overview of ML
   applications in water resource management, this research focuses on core
   fundamentals, major applications (prediction, clustering, and
   reinforcement learning), and ongoing issues to offer new insights. More
   specifically, after the in-depth illustration of the ML algorithmic
   taxonomy, we provide a comparative mapping of all ML methodologies to
   specific water management tasks. At the same time, we include a
   tabulation of such research works along with some concrete, yet compact,
   descriptions of their objectives at hand. By leveraging ML tools, we can
   develop sustainable water resource management plans and address the
   world's water supply concerns effectively.

AB As a new form of sustainable development, the concept "Smart Cities"
   knows a large expansion during the recent years. It represents an urban
   model, refers to all alternative approaches to metropolitan IC's case to
   enhance quality and performance of urban service for better interaction
   between citizens and government. However, the smart cities based on
   distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions
   of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion
   devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In
   Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with
   information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models).
   Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection:
   imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework
   general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and
   combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief
   functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from
   autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of
   imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision,
   uncertainty, ignorance andlor incompleteness. Any imperfection in data
   within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of
   urban services and decision making. In this context, we address in this
   article the problem of imperfection in smart city data. We will focus on
   handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and
   data integration and we will create an evidential database by using the
   evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. The
   expected outcomes from this paper are (1) to focus on handling
   imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data
   integration (2) to create an evidential database by using the evidence
   theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. As
   experimentation we present a special case of modeling imperfect data in
   the field of Healthcare. An evidential database will be built which will
   contain all the perfect and imperfect data. These data come from several
   Heterogeneous sources in a context of Smart Cities. Imperfect aspects in
   the evidential database expressed by the theory of beliefs that will

AB Obtaining the accurate and real-time state of surrounding objects is
   essential for automated vehicle planning and decision-making to ensure
   safe driving. In complex traffic scenarios, object occlusion, clutter
   interference, and limited sensor detection capabilities lead to false
   alarms and missed object detection, making it challenging to ensure the
   stability of tracking and state prediction. To address these challenges,
   in this study, we developed a robust multi-object detection and tracking
   method for moving objects based on radar and camera data fusion. First,
   the radar and camera perform target detection independently, and the
   detection results are correlated in the image plane to generate a random
   finite set with an object type. Then, based on the Gaussian mixture
   probability hypothesis density algorithm framework, the tracking process
   is improved using elliptic discriminant thresholds, an attenuation
   function, and simplified pruning methods. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the improved algorithm can accurately estimate the
   number and state of targets in object occlusion, measurement loss
   scenarios, and achieve robust continuous multi-object tracking. The
   proposed method could guide the design of safer and more efficient
   intelligent driving systems.

   his/her tumor. The last decade witnessed the development of
   high-throughput technologies such as microarrays and next-generation
   sequencing which paved the way to PM in the field of oncology. While the
   cost of these technologies decreases, we are facing an exponential
   increase in the amount of data produced. Our ability to use this
   information in daily practice relies strongly on the availability of an
   efficient bioinformatics system that assists in the translation of
   knowledge from the bench towards molecular targeting and diagnosis.
   Clinical trials and routine diagnoses constitute different approaches,
   both requiring a strong bioinformatics environment capable of (i)
   warranting the integration and the traceability of data, (ii) ensuring
   the correct processing and analyses of genomic data, and (iii) applying
   welldefined and reproducible procedures for workflow management and
   decision-making. To address the issues, a seamless information system
   was developed at Institut Curie which facilitates the data integration
   and tracks in real-time the processing of individual samples. Moreover,
   computational pipelines were developed to identify reliably genomic
   alterations and mutations from the molecular profiles of each patient.
   After a rigorous quality control, a meaningful report is delivered to
   the clinicians and biologists for the therapeutic decision. The complete
   bioinformatics environment and the key points of its implementation are
   presented in the context of the SHIVA clinical trial, a multicentric
   randomized phase II trial comparing targeted therapy based on tumor
   molecular profiling versus conventional therapy in patients with
   refractory cancer. The numerous challenges faced in practice during the
   setting up and the conduct of this trial are discussed as an
   illustration of PM application.

   The proposed methodology has been developed to support the Asset
   Management (AM) decision making according to an open Building
   Information Modelling (openBIM) approach. Within the context of the West
   Cambridge Digital Twin Research Facility, a real case scenario has been
   considered, where the as-built data is imprecise or absent. The
   methodology is well suited to dealing with incomplete data on existing
   buildings, when the objective is integration among AM, the Internet of
   Things (IoT) and BIM information.
   Digital Twins (DT) are powerful tools to support asset managers in the
   operation and maintenance of cognitive buildings. Building Information
   Models (BIM) are critical for Asset Management (AM), especially when
   used in conjunction with Internet of Things (IoT) and other asset data
   collected throughout a building's lifecycle. However, information
   contained within BIM models is usually outdated, inaccurate, and
   incomplete as a result of unclear geometric and semantic data modelling
   procedures during the building life cycle. The aim of this paper is to
   develop an openBIM methodology to support dynamic AM applications with
   limited as-built information availability. The workflow is based on the
   use of the IfcSharedFacilitiesElements schema for processing the
   geometric and semantic information of both existing and newly created
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) objects, supporting real-time data
   integration. The methodology is validated using the West Cambridge DT
   Research Facility data, demonstrating good potential in supporting an
   asset anomaly detection application. The proposed workflow increases the
   automation of the digital AM processes, thanks to the adoption of
   BIM-IoT integration tools and methods within the context of the
   development of a building DT.

AB In recent years, the architecture, engineering, construction, and
   facility management (FM) industries have been applying various emerging
   digital technologies to facilitate the design, construction, and
   management of infrastructure facilities. Digital twin (DT) has emerged
   as a solution for enabling real-time data acquisition, transfer,
   analysis, and utilization for improved decision-making toward smart FM.
   Substantial research on DT for FM has been undertaken in the past
   decade. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the literature on
   DT for FM. A total of 248 research articles are obtained from the Scopus
   and Web of Science databases. VOSviewer is then utilized to conduct
   bibliometric analysis and visualize keyword cooccurrence, citation, and
   co-authorship networks; furthermore, the research topics, authors,
   sources, and countries contributing to the use of DT for FM are
   identified. The findings show that the current research of DT in FM
   focuses on building information modeling-based FM, artificial
   intelligence (AI)-based predictive maintenance, real-time cyber-physical
   system data integration, and facility lifecycle asset management.
   Several areas, such as AI-based real-time asset prognostics and health
   management, virtual-based intelligent infrastructure monitoring, deep
   learning-aided continuous improvement of the FM systems, semantically
   rich data interoperability throughout the facility lifecycle, and
   autonomous control feedback, need to be further studied. This review
   contributes to the body of knowledge on digital transformation and smart
   FM by identifying the landscape, state-of-the-art research trends, and
   future needs with regard to DT in FM.

AB Remote sensing plays a critical role in operational volcano monitoring
   due to the often remote locations of volcanic systems and the large
   spatial extent of potential eruption pre-cursor signals. Despite the
   all-weather capabilities of radar remote sensing and its high
   performance in monitoring of change, the contribution of radar data to
   operational monitoring activities has been limited in the past. This is
   largely due to: (1) the high costs associated with radar data; (2)
   traditionally slow data processing and delivery procedures; and (3) the
   limited temporal sampling provided by spaceborne radars. With this
   paper, we present new data processing and data integration techniques
   that mitigate some of these limitations and allow for a meaningful
   integration of radar data into operational volcano monitoring decision
   support systems. Specifically, we present fast data access procedures as
   well as new approaches to multi-track processing that improve near
   real-time data access and temporal sampling of volcanic systems with SAR
   data. We introduce phase-based (coherent) and amplitude-based
   (incoherent) change detection procedures that are able to extract dense
   time series of hazard information from these data. For a demonstration,
   we present an integration of our processing system with an operational
   volcano monitoring system that was developed for use by the Alaska
   Volcano Observatory (AVO). Through an application to a historic
   eruption, we show that the integration of SAR into systems such as AVO
   can significantly improve the ability of operational systems to detect
   eruptive precursors. Therefore, the developed technology is expected to
   improve operational hazard detection, alerting, and management
   capabilities. (C) 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and

AB Data fusion integrates data from multiple sources to improve prediction
   performance. While significant research has been conducted to develop
   data-level and feature-level fusion methods, very few studies are
   performed to develop more effective decision-level data fusion methods.
   This research aims at developing a decision-level data fusion approach
   that transforms low-dimensional decisions (i.e., predictions) made based
   on individual sensor data such as temperature and vibration to
   high-dimensional decisions. Integration of these high-dimensional
   decisions is formulated as a convex optimization problem rather than a
   traditional multivariate linear regression problem. The proposed
   decision-level data fusion approach is demonstrated in two cases: 1)
   quality control in additive manufacturing and 2) predictive maintenance
   in aircraft engines. Experimental results have shown that the proposed
   decision-level fusion method can reduce prediction variance by at least
   30% as well as increase prediction accuracy by 45%. Note to
   Practitioners-This article was motivated by a need to make more accurate
   predictions with multiple sensors. Traditional data-level and
   feature-level fusion methods integrate raw sensor data from individual
   sensors and statistical features extracted from individual sensors,
   respectively. This article suggests a novel decision-level fusion
   approach as opposed to the traditional data- and feature-level fusion
   methods. In the first case study, temperature and vibration sensor data
   are integrated to predict the surface roughness of additively
   manufactured components. In the second case study, multiple sensor data
   are fused to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of aircraft
   engines. To implement the decision-level fusion technique, it is
   critical to determine optimal weights by solving the convex optimization
   problem. In future research, we will demonstrate the proposed
   decision-level fusion approach in real-time prognostics and
   health-monitoring applications.

AB Personalized products have gradually become the main business model and
   core competencies of many enterprises. Large differences in components
   and short delivery cycles of such products, however, require industrial
   robots in cloud manufacturing (CMfg) to be smarter, more responsive and
   more flexible. This means that the deep learning models (DLMs) for smart
   robots should have the performance of real-time response, optimization,
   adaptability, dynamism, and multimodal data fusion. To satisfy these
   typical demands, a cloud-edge-device collaboration framework of CMfg is
   first proposed to support smart collaborative decision-making for smart
   robots. Meanwhile, in this context, different deployment and update
   mechanisms of DLMs for smart robots are analyzed in detail, aiming to
   support rapid response and high-performance decision-making by
   considering the factors of data sources, data processing location,
   offline/online learning, data sharing and the life cycle of DLMs. In
   addition, related key technologies are presented to provide references
   for technical research directions in this field.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic presented enormous data challenges in the United
   States. Policy makers, epidemiological modelers, and health researchers
   all require up-to-date data on the pandemic and relevant public
   behavior, ideally at fine spatial and temporal resolution. The COVID
   cast API is our attempt to fill this need: Operational since April 2020,
   it provides open access to both traditional public health surveillance
   signals (cases, deaths, and hospitalizations) and many auxiliary
   indicators of COVID-19 activity, such as signals extracted from
   deidentified medical claims data, massive online surveys, cell phone
   mobility data, and internet search trends. These are available at a fine
   geographic resolution (mostly at the county level) and are updated
   daily. The COVIDcast API also tracks all revisions to historical data,
   allowing modelers to account for the frequent revisions and backfill
   that are common for many public health data sources. All of the data are
   available in a common format through the API and accompanying R and
   Python software packages. This paper describes the data sources and
   signals, and provides examples demonstrating that the auxiliary signals
   in the COVIDcast API present information relevant to tracking COVID
   activity, augmenting traditional public health reporting and empowering
   research and decision-making.

AB Digital twin is a virtual model that represents physical entities in a
   digital manner. By leveraging means of data to simulate the behavior of
   physical entities in the real environment, the functions of physical
   entities can be optimized and expanded, through virtual and real
   interaction feedback, data fusion, decision making, and optimization.
   Despite numerous researches on digital twin concept and its
   applications, scarcely any discusses about the computation efficiency of
   the twin established. In order to shorten the latency of mapping and
   reduce the high computation workload in the cloud, this paper develops a
   cyber-physical machine tool based on edge computing techniques, to
   realize remote sensing, real-time monitoring and scalable
   high-performance digital twin application. Furthermore, a novel edge
   computing algorithm is proposed to detect the abnormality of the edge
   data from two aspects: the unary outliers of the edge data itself and
   the multivariate parameter correlation among edge devices. The
   effectiveness of the application platform of the cyber-physical machine
   tool developed is verified by the prototype system and edge algorithm

AB With the diffusion of information systems and new technologies for the
   real-time capturing of data, especially in rapid technological and
   managerial innovation contexts such as the automotive industry,
   data-driven decisionmaking (DDM) has now the potential to generate
   dramatic improvements in the performance of manufacturing firms.
   However, there is still a lack of evidence in literature on whether
   these technologies can actually enhance the effectiveness of data-driven
   approaches. The aim of this article is to investigate the impact of DDM
   on operational performance moderated by two main dimensions of
   digitalization: data integration and the breadth of new digitization
   technologies. The results of a cross-country survey of 138 Italian and
   U.S. auto-supplier firms, which was supported by plant visits and
   interviews, suggest that an interplay between DDM and the two dimensions
   exists. Higher degrees of data integration in information systems
   increase the positive effect of DDM on the probability of cost
   reductions. On the other hand, introducing multiple emerging
   digitization technologies leads to worse DDM results, in terms of cost
   performance. The conclusion that can be drawn is that the operational
   employees of auto-supplier firms are now facing difficulties in
   successfully combining real-time operational data from various sources
   and in exploiting them for decision-making. Managers and workers need to
   align their intuition, experience and analytical capabilities to
   initiate the digitalization process. The challenge, in the medium term,
   is to limit the difficulties of implementing new digitization
   technologies and integrating their data, to embrace DDM and fully grasp
   the potential of data analytics in operations.

AB Effective civil infrastructure management necessitates the utilization
   of timely data across the entire asset lifecycle for condition
   assessment and predictive maintenance. A notable gap in current
   predictive maintenance practices is the reliance on single-source data
   instead of heterogeneous data, decreasing data accuracy, reliability,
   adaptability, and further effectiveness of engineering decision-making.
   Data fusion is thus demanded to transform low-dimensional decisions from
   individual sensors into high-dimensional ones for decision optimization.
   In this context, digital twin (DT) technology is set to revolutionize
   the civil infrastructure industry by facilitating real-time data
   processing and informed decision-making. However, data-driven smart
   civil infrastructure management using DT is not yet achieved, especially
   in terms of data fusion. This paper aims to establish a conceptual
   framework for harnessing DT technology with data fusion to ensure the
   efficiency of civil infrastructures throughout their lifecycle. To
   achieve this objective, a systematic review of 105 papers was conducted
   to thematically analyze data fusion approaches and DT frameworks for
   civil infrastructure management, including their applications, core DT
   technologies, and challenges. Several gaps are identified, such as the
   difficulty in data integration due to data heterogeneity, seamless
   interoperability, difficulties associated with data quality, maintaining
   the semantic features of big data, technological limitations, and
   complexities with algorithm selection. Given these challenges, this
   research proposed a framework emphasizing multilayer data fusion, the
   integration of open building information modeling (openBIM) and
   geographic information system (GIS) for immersive visualization and
   stakeholder engagement, and the adoption of extended industry foundation
   classes (IFC) for data integration throughout the asset lifecycle.

AB A new data fusion operator based on averaging that is weighted by the
   density of each particular data sample is introduced in this paper. The
   proposed approach differs from other weighted averages by its
   suitability to on-line, real-time applications due to the fact that
   recursive calculations are being used. It also differs by the fact that
   it is non-parametric. The proposed operator has a very wide area of
   possible applications same as the traditional average and most of the
   other weighted averages. This includes, but is not limited to
   clustering, classification, pattern recognition, group decision making
   approaches, data fusion, etc. Some illustrative numerical examples are
   provided mainly as a proof of concept, including its application to
   classification. Two simple, yet very effective classification approaches
   based on the density-based weights called 'one-rule-per-class' or 1R/C
   and on the minimum distance to weighted class mean has been introduced.
   Further work will focus on more application-oriented studies that cover
   various practical applications to clustering and use of different
   distance measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The rapid advancements in technology have paved the way for innovative
   solutions in the healthcare domain, aiming to improve scalability and
   security while enhancing patient care. This abstract introduces a
   cutting-edge approach, leveraging blockchain technology and hybrid deep
   learning techniques to revolutionize healthcare systems. Blockchain
   technology provides a decentralized and transparent framework, enabling
   secure data storage, sharing, and access control. By integrating
   blockchain into healthcare systems, data integrity, privacy, and
   interoperability can be ensured while eliminating the reliance on
   centralized authorities. In conjunction with blockchain, hybrid deep
   learning techniques offer powerful capabilities for data analysis and
   decision making in healthcare. Combining the strengths of deep learning
   algorithms with traditional machine learning approaches, hybrid deep
   learning enables accurate and efficient processing of complex healthcare
   data, including medical records, images, and sensor data. This research
   proposes a permissions-based blockchain framework for scalable and
   secure healthcare systems, integrating hybrid deep learning models. The
   framework ensures that only authorized entities can access and modify
   sensitive health information, preserving patient privacy while
   facilitating seamless data sharing and collaboration among healthcare
   providers. Additionally, the hybrid deep learning models enable
   real-time analysis of large-scale healthcare data, facilitating timely
   diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and disease prediction. The
   integration of blockchain and hybrid deep learning presents numerous
   benefits, including enhanced scalability, improved security,
   interoperability, and informed decision making in healthcare systems.
   However, challenges such as computational complexity, regulatory
   compliance, and ethical considerations need to be addressed for
   successful implementation. By harnessing the potential of blockchain and
   hybrid deep learning, healthcare systems can overcome traditional
   limitations, promoting efficient and secure data management,
   personalized patient care, and advancements in medical research. The
   proposed framework lays the foundation for a future healthcare ecosystem
   that prioritizes scalability, security, and improved patient outcomes.

AB Urban surveillance, of which airborne urban surveillance is a vital
   constituent, provides situational awareness (SA) and timely response to
   emergencies. The significance and scope of urban surveillance has
   increased manyfold in recent years due to the proliferation of unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs), Internet of things (IoTs), and multitude of
   sensors. In this article, we propose FogSurv-a fogassisted surveillance
   architecture and framework leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and
   information/data fusion for enabling real-time SA and monitoring. We
   also propose an AI- and data-driven information fusion model for FogSurv
   to help provide (near) real-time SA, threat assessment, and automated
   decision-making. We further present a latency model for AI and
   information fusion processing in FogSurv. We then discuss several use
   cases of FogSurv that can have a huge impact on multifarious fronts of
   national significance ranging from safeguarding national security to
   monitoring of critical infrastructures. We conduct an extensive set of
   experiments to demonstrate that FogSurv using AI and data fusion help
   provide near real-time inferences and SA. Experimental results
   demonstrate that FogSurv provides a latency improvement of 37% on
   average over cloud architectures for the selected benchmarks. Results
   further indicate that combining AI with data fusion as in FogSurv can
   provide a speedup of up to 9.8x over AI without data fusion while also
   maintaining or improving the inference accuracy. Additionally, results
   show that AI combined with fusion of different image modalities obtained
   through UAVs in FogSurv results in improved average precision of target
   detection for surveillance as compared to AI without data fusion for
   different target scales and environment complexity.

AB Decision-making on whole-life-cycle net-zero-carbon buildings is
   critical for addressing carbon emission and environmental problems.
   However, there is a lack of a data integration framework and an open
   international standard approach integrating key decision variables to
   support scientific computations and decision-making for whole-life-cycle
   net-zero-carbon buildings. Building information modelling (BIM) is an
   open international standard representing building information. Digital
   Twin (DT) can capture and monitor real-time building conditions to
   facilitate building operation. Integrating information acquired by DT
   with BIM has considerable potential to enable an open international
   standard based computational representation of key decision variables
   throughout the whole-building life cycle process. This paper aims to
   develop a novel conceptual framework that integrates BIM and DT to
   support net-zero-carbon buildings. The framework is developed using an
   open international standard approach and the ontology-based
   representation method, to define key decision variables using entities,
   properties, and relationships, and integrates captured data via DT. The
   research makes significant contributions to enable net-zero-carbon
   buildings and paves the way for future research on an automated system
   to support decision-making for the whole-life-cycle net-zero-carbon
   buildings.

AB The aim of this paper is to detect the incipient anomalies in a
   ultraprecision machining (UPM) process by integrating multiple in situ
   sensor signals. To realize this aim we forward a Bayesian non-parametric
   Dirichlet Process (DP) decision-making approach for real-time monitoring
   of UPM process using the data gathered from multiple, heterogeneous
   sensors. The sensor signals are acquired under different experimental
   conditions from a UPM setup instrumented with a heterogeneous sensing
   array consisting of miniature tri-axis force, tri-axis vibration, and
   acoustic emission (AE) sensors mounted in close proximity to the cutting
   tool. We track the prominent nonlinear and non-Gaussian signal patterns
   evident in the experimentally acquired sensor data using an adaptive
   non-parametric DP modeling technique. A cohesive decision concerning the
   UPM process condition is made by developing a new supervised learning
   method, which integrates the DP-model state estimates with an evidence
   theoretic sensor data fusion method. Using this combined DP-evidence
   theoretic approach, UPM process drifts and anomalies, such as sudden
   changes in the depth of cut, feed rate, and spindle speed that
   deleteriously affect surface finish, and hence cause high yield losses,
   are detected and classified with over 90% accuracy (with % standard
   deviation). We compared these results with popular classification
   techniques, e.g., naive Bayes, self-organizing map, and support vector
   machine; these conventional techniques had classification accuracy in
   the range of 83%-88%. Consequently, this research makes the following
   practically relevant contributions: 1) real-time identification of the
   incipient UPM process anomalies from multiple sensors and 2) prescribing
   the optimal subset of sensors signals contingent to particular process
   anomalies.

   within the built environment industry, facilitating digital
   transformation through advanced data integration and analytics. DTs have
   demonstrated significant benefits in building design, construction, and
   asset management, including optimising lifecycle energy use, enhancing
   operational efficiency, enabling predictive maintenance, and improving
   user adaptability. By integrating real-time data from IoT sensors with
   advanced analytics, DTs provide dynamic and actionable insights for
   better decision-making and resource management. Despite these promising
   benefits, several challenges impede the widespread adoption of DT
   technology, such as technological integration, data consistency,
   organisational adaptation, and cybersecurity concerns. Addressing these
   challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration, standardisation of
   data formats, and the development of universal design and development
   platforms for DTs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of DT
   definitions, applications, capabilities, and challenges within the
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries. This paper
   provides important insights for researchers and professionals, helping
   them gain a more comprehensive and detailed view of DT. The findings
   also demonstrate the significant impact that DTs can have on this
   sector, contributing to advancing DT implementations and promoting
   sustainable and efficient building management practices. Ultimately, DT
   technology is set to revolutionise the AEC industries by enabling
   autonomous, data-driven decision-making and optimising building
   operations for enhanced productivity and performance.

AB In a ubiquitous environment, various enterprise information systems
   (EISs) are used for supporting daily operations. Besides, with the
   support with Auto-ID technology, enterprises are able to collect
   real-time operation data but these data are continuously pushed to
   different EISs. Data without processing are meaningless and not able to
   support managerial decision-makings. The wide use of EISs and Auto-ID
   devices within an enterprise increases the difficulties in data
   interoperability among difficult data sources. Since data sources from
   applications and devices are characterized by multiple types of
   hetero-geneities, such as communication protocols, blinding methods, and
   developing environments, the difficulty in managing heterogeneous data
   sources is highly raised. Information integration in ubiquitous
   enterprises is critical because it has a significant influence on the
   efficiency and effectiveness of decisions. This article presents an
   innovative Data-Source Interoperability Service (DSIS) that serves as a
   middle-ware for providing a querying and information integration service
   for heterogeneous data sources. The DSIS applies software agent
   technology that is capable of accomplishing tasks in an autonomous way
   without human intervention. Operations provided by DSIS Agent are
   converted into standard web services. The agent-based services are
   managed by DSIS Universal Description, Discovery and Integration

AB A massive amount of multimodal data are continuously collected in the
   intensive care unit (ICU) along each patient stay, offering a great
   opportunity for the development of smart monitoring devices based on
   artificial intelligence (AI). The two main sources of relevant
   information collected in the ICU are the electronic health records
   (EHRs) and vital sign waveforms continuously recorded at the bedside.
   While EHRs are already widely processed by AI algorithms for prompt
   diagnosis and prognosis, AI-based assessments of the patients'
   pathophysiological state using waveforms are less developed, and their
   use is still limited to real-time monitoring for basic visual vital sign
   feedback at the bedside. This study uses data from the MIMIC-III
   database (PhysioNet) to propose a novel AI approach in ICU patient
   monitoring that incorporates features estimated by a closed-loop
   cardiovascular model, with the specific goal of identifying sepsis
   within the first hour of admission. Our top benchmark results (AUROC =
   0.92, AUPRC = 0.90) suggest that features derived by cardiovascular
   control models may play a key role in identifying sepsis, by continuous
   monitoring performed through advanced multivariate modelling of vital
   sign waveforms. This work lays foundations for a deeper data integration
   paradigm which will help clinicians in their decision-making processes.

AB Optimum microclimate parameters, including air temperature (T), relative
   humidity (RH) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) that are uniformly
   distributed inside greenhouse crop production systems are essential to
   prevent yield loss and fruit quality. The objective of this research was
   to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the microclimate
   data of a commercial greenhouse with tomato plants located in the
   mid-west of Iran. For this purpose, wireless sensor data fusion was
   incorporated with a membership function model called Optimality Degree
   (OptDeg) for real-time monitoring and dynamic assessment of T, RH and
   VPD in different light conditions and growth stages of tomato. This
   approach allows growers to have a simultaneous projection of raw data
   into a normalized index between 0 and 1. Custom-built hardware and
   software based on the concept of the Internet-of-Things, including
   Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) transmitter nodes, a multi-channel
   LoRaWAN gateway and a web-based data monitoring dashboard were used for
   data collection, data processing and monitoring. The experimental
   approach consisted of the collection of meteorological data from the
   external environment by means of a weather station and via a grid of 20
   wireless sensor nodes distributed in two horizontal planes at two
   different heights inside the greenhouse. Offline data processing for
   sensors calibration and model validation was carried in multiple MATLAB
   Simulink blocks. Preliminary results revealed a significant deviation of
   the microclimate parameters from optimal growth conditions for tomato
   cultivation due to the inaccurate timer-based heating and cooling
   control systems used in the greenhouse. The mean OptDeg of T, RH and VPD
   were 0.67, 0.94, 0.94 in January, 0.45, 0.36, 0.42 in June and 0.44,
   0.0, 0.12 in July, respectively. An in-depth analysis of data revealed
   that averaged OptDeg values, as well as their spatial variations in the
   horizontal profile were closer to the plants' comfort zone in the cold
   season as compared with those in the warm season. This was attributed to
   the use of heating systems in the cold season and the lack of automated
   cooling devices in the warm season. This study confirmed the
   applicability of using IoT sensors for real-time model-based assessment
   of greenhouse microclimate on a commercial scale. The presented IoT
   sensor node and the Simulink model provide growers with a better insight
   into interpreting crop growth environment. The outcome of this research
   contributes to the improvement of closed-field cultivation of tomato by
   providing an integrated decision-making framework that explores
   microclimate variation at different growth stages in the production
   season.

AB Robust information on consumptive water use (evapotranspiration, ET)
   derived from remote sensing can significantly benefit water
   decision-making in agriculture, informing irrigation schedules and water
   management plans over extended regions. To be of optimal utility for
   operational usage, these remote sensing ET data should be generated at
   the sub-field spatial resolution and daily-to-weekly timesteps
   commensurate with the scales of water management activities. However,
   current methods for field-scale ET retrieval based on thermal infrared
   (TIR) imaging, a valuable diagnostic of canopy stress and surface
   moisture status, are limited by the temporal revisit of available
   medium-resolution (100 m or finer) thermal satellite sensors. This study
   investigates the efficacy of a data fusion method for combining
   information from multiple medium-resolution sensors toward generating
   high spatiotemporal resolution ET products for water management. TIR
   data from Landsat and ECOSTRESS (both at similar to 100-m native
   resolution), and VIIRS (375-m native) are sharpened to a common 30-m
   grid using surface reflectance data from the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel
   dataset. Periodic 30-m ET retrievals from these combined thermal data
   sources are fused with daily retrievals from unsharpened VIIRS to
   generate daily, 30-m ET image timeseries. The accuracy of this mapping
   method is tested over several irrigated cropping systems in the Central
   Valley of California in comparison with flux tower observations,
   including measurements over irrigated vineyards collected in the GRAPEX
   campaign. Results demonstrate the operational value added by the
   augmented TIR sensor suite compared to Landsat alone, in terms of
   capturing daily ET variability and reduced latency for real-time
   applications. The method also provides means for incorporating new
   sources of imaging from future planned thermal missions, further
   improving our ability to map rapid changes in crop water use at field
   scales.

AB Linguistic data summarization targets the description of patterns
   emerging in data by means of linguistic expressions. Just as human
   beings do, computers can use natural language to represent and fuse
   heterogeneous data in a multi criteria decision making environment.
   Linguistic data description is particularly well suited for applications
   in which there is a necessity of understanding data at different levels
   of expertise or human-computer interaction is involved. In this paper,
   an application for the linguistic descriptions of driving activity in a
   simulation environment has been developed. In order to ensure safe
   driving practices, all new onboard devices in transportation systems
   need to be evaluated. Work performed in this application paper will be
   used for the automatic evaluation of onboard devices. Based on Fuzzy
   Logic, and as a contribution to Computational Theory of Perceptions, the
   proposed solution is part of our research on granular linguistic models
   of phenomena. The application generates a set of valid sentences
   describing the quality of driving. Then a relevancy analysis is
   performed in order to compile the most representative and suitable
   statements in a final report. Real time-series data from a vehicle
   simulator have been used to evaluate the performance of the presented
   application in the framework of a real project. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

AB Construction 4.0 is witnessing exponential growth in digital twin (DT)
   technology developments and applications, revolutionizing the adoption
   of building information modelling (BIM) and other emerging technologies
   used throughout the built environment lifecycle. BIM provides
   technologies, procedures, and data schemas representing building
   components and systems. At the same time, the DT enhances this with
   real-time data for integrating cyber-physical systems, enabling live
   asset monitoring and better decision making. Despite being in the early
   stages of development, DT applications have rapidly progressed in the
   AEC sector, resulting in a diverse literature landscape due to the
   various technologies and parameters involved in fully developing the DT
   technology. The intricate complexities inherent in digital twin
   advancements have confused professionals and researchers. This confusion
   arises from the nuanced distinctions between the two technologies, i.e.,
   BIM and DT, causing a convergence that hinders realizing their
   potential. To address this confusion and lead to a swift development of
   DT technology, this study provides a holistic review of the existing
   research focusing on the critical components responsible for developing
   the applications of DT technology in the construction industry. It
   highlights five crucial elements: technologies, maturity levels, data
   layers, enablers, and functionalities. Additionally, it identifies
   research gaps and proposes future avenues for streamlined DT
   developments and applications in the AEC sector. Future researchers and
   practitioners can target data integrity, integration and transmission,
   bi-directional interoperability, non-technical factors, and data
   security to achieve mature digital twin applications for AEC practices.
   This study highlights the growing significance of DTs in construction
   and provides a foundation for further advancements in this field to
   harness its potential to transform built environment practices. It also
   pinpoints the latest developments in AI, namely the large language model
   (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)'s implications for DT
   education, policies, and the construction industry's practices.

AB Information and communication technology's role in developing smart city
   platforms has allowed cities to grow smarter in recent years. In order
   to develop a smart city platform, digital twin technology can be
   implemented to monitor and simulate the city's conditions. Furthermore,
   it can function as a precise decision-support system. Digital twins can
   be combined with augmented reality technology to develop a smart city
   platform. The combination of these two technologies aims to visualize
   data for monitoring and simulating conditions in a city. The primary
   concern about the necessity of a digital twin platform in smart cities
   pertains to creating a robust digital twin-enabled smart city platform
   that can efficiently monitor urban conditions and provide significant
   insights for decision-making. Hence, this research aims to develop a
   smart city platform with digital twins as its foundation. This platform
   would enable real-time data visualization inside an environment that
   facilitates clear and effective information communication to users. The
   smart city platform development method is divided into four layers,
   namely developing (1) the basic layer that contains basic information
   about the city; (2) the 3D layer that contains the city's 3D assets; (3)
   the digital twin layer for real-time data integration; (4) the augmented
   layer for augmenting the digital twin data. This research also proposes
   an architecture that will become the basis of the flow for the digital
   twin platform development. The result of developing the platform is a
   smart city platform based on a digital twin that can be used to monitor
   the condition of the city. This platform can be input for users or the
   community in planning their daily activities and can be decision support
   to the government in developing the city.

AB Advanced driver-assistance systems have recently become one of the most
   active topics related to intelligent vehicles. Such assistance
   facilitates vehicular operation by allowing drivers increased control
   and an enhanced driving experience, and it even comes in the form of
   automated assistance for autonomous vehicle operation. This paper
   presents a driver-assistance system that uses a low-cost embedded
   digital signal processor, with the overall system installed in a
   commercial vehicle. Based on driving information supplied by multiple
   sensors, such as a real-time vision system, a vehicle-to-vehicle
   communication system, and in-vehicle sensors, the proposed system can
   facilitate decision making and the performing of driving tasks while
   executing overtaking maneuvers. This paper developed a data fusion stage
   based on a collision warning algorithm in which the overtaken vehicle
   and other vehicles in the neighboring lane are accounted for to avoid
   collisions. The system employs fuzzy control in the steering and speed
   automation to emulate the driving tasks performed by humans. The
   applicability of the proposed system was examined in a real-road
   environment, and a set of experimental results demonstrate the
   feasibility of using the involved coordination strategies while
   conducting various driving maneuvers.

AB This paper addresses various issues in the literature concerning
   adversarial attack detection in Vehicular Ad -hoc Networks (VANETs).
   These issues include the failure to consider both normal and adversarial
   attack perspectives simultaneously in Machine Learning (ML) model
   development, the lack of diversity preprocessing techniques for VANETs
   communication datasets, the inadequate selection guidelines for
   real-time adversarial attack detection models, and the limited emphasis
   on explainability in adversarial attack detection. In this study, we
   propose an original fuzzy decision -making framework that incorporates
   multiple fusion standpoints. Our framework aims to evaluate multi -ML
   models for real-time adversarial attack detection in VANETs, focusing on
   three stages. The first stage involves identifying and preprocessing
   Dedicated Short -Range Communication (DSRC) data using standard and
   fusion preprocessing approaches. Two communication scenarios, normal and
   jammed, are considered, resulting in two DSRC datasets. In the second
   stage, we develop multi -ML models based on the DSRC datasets using
   standard preprocessing and feature fusion preprocessing for dataset-1
   and dataset-2, respectively. The third stage evaluates the multi -ML
   models using a fuzzy decision -making approach based on the Fuzzy
   Decision by Opinion Score Method (FDOSM) and an adversarial attack
   decision fusion matrix. The External Fusion Decision (EFD) settings of
   the FDOSM address individual ranking variance, provide a unique rank and
   select the best model. Experimental results demonstrate that the K
   -Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (kNN) model achieves the highest explain
   score of 0.2048 in dataset-1 using standard preprocessing, while the
   Random Forest (RF) model applied to dataset-2 using fusion preprocessing
   emerges as the most robust and golden model against adversarial attacks,
   with a score of 0.1819. This finding suggests that the fusion
   preprocessing approach using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is more
   suitable for addressing normal and adversarial attack perspectives.
   Furthermore, our fuzzy framework undergoes evaluation in terms of
   systematic rank, sensitivity analysis, explainability analysis, and
   comparison analysis. Overall, this framework provides valuable insights
   for researchers and practitioners in VANETs, informing the execution,
   selection, and interpretation of multi -ML models to tackle adversarial
   attack detection problems effectively. The new fuzzy framework
   demonstrates that multiML models based on feature fusion preprocessing
   are more effective.

AB In intelligent transportation system (ITS), accurate and real-time
   prediction of short-term multi-lane traffic flow with existing traffic
   data is an important part of urban traffic planning, traffic management
   and control. The data generated in the process of vehicle driving has
   the cooperative characteristics of multi-source, space-time and dynamic.
   Combining the data with high-performance computing or cloud computing, a
   new space-time information framework is designed, which is of great
   significance for the analysis and prediction of traffic flow, as well as
   intelligent traffic management, service and decision-making. This paper
   analyzes the statistical characteristics of urban road traffic flow from
   the two dimensions of time and space through the spatial-temporal
   correlation between multi-lane short term traffic flow in single
   observation point and multi observation points. We constructed a data
   fusion powered bi-directional long short term memory (DFBD-LSTM) model
   for individual lane and aggregate traffic flow, then used this model to
   predict multi-lane short term traffic flow. By taking individual lane
   traffic flow and aggregate traffic flow as different variables, the
   model produces more accurate predictions, which can better guide people
   to travel, alleviate the congestion of urban road traffic network to a
   certain extent, and improve the utilization rate and transportation
   efficiency of traffic road.

AB The use of pasture measurement tools and decision-support systems (DSS)
   for grazing management remains limited on New Zealand dairy farms.
   However, effective use of such tools provides opportunities to optimise
   pasture grown and pasture harvested. The present study used a
   mixed-method qualitative research approach to investigate pasture data
   and technology use for grazing decision making, through interviews and
   workshops with farmers, rural professionals, commercial software
   developers and a panel of farming-system specialists. Results suggest
   that different drivers for use of pasture data and DSS exist between
   farm owner-operators and corporate farming operations. Larger multi-farm
   businesses are collecting pasture data for use at a governance level as
   well as for operational decision making. Understanding the seasonal
   influences on decision making, and incorporating major regional
   differences such as pasture growth rates and impact of irrigation use,
   provides guidance on how to better match DSS to farmer practice. Study
   participants identified a need for greater integration of software tools
   to connect in-paddock data capture with real-time feedback. Also, data
   integration is needed to enable the transfer of information across
   different platforms for corporate farming operations. Rural
   professionals used commercial grazing DSS products, but also constructed
   their own spreadsheets to enable functionality and reporting not
   available in the DSS products. The research highlighted a need for
   farmer-orientated tools that are flexible to incorporate differences in
   user goals, decision making, mobility and desired outputs. Key
   attributes identified were seasonality, simplicity, ability to trial
   before purchase, flexibility in application, scalability to match farm
   systems, and integration with other tools. Future research and design of
   DSS tools requires a focus on co-creation with farmers, to merge
   scientific and practical knowledge.

AB There are many studies adopting artificial intelligence (AI) to develop
   core technologies for the future army but they are still at the level of
   basic research. It is expected that military power will be negatively
   affected by aging and declining population. In addition, as more than
   500,000 agents will be dispatched to monitor combat scenes, the data
   sensed by each agent should be managed simultaneously recognize and
   evaluate the situation on the battlefield in real time. Despite
   increased complexity in the battlefield, current command system entirely
   rely on the experience and expertise of individual commanders, which
   severely restricts defense capabilities. Therefore, AI based military
   staff needs to be developed to identify potential threats that
   commanders are likely to miss, to develop smart command systems, and to
   provide data-driven rationale for commander's decisions. In this paper,
   we propose a deep AI military staff to support commander
   decision-making. Our proposed model is composed of four key parts:
   multi-agent based manned-unmanned collaboration architecture (MACA),
   robust tactical map fusion technology in poor environments (RTMF),
   hypergraph based representation learning (HRL) and space-time multi
   layer model for battlefields recognition (STBR). We design an
   architecture and generate dataset for training the core network.
   Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of Deep
   AI military staff.

AB Humans are blessed with the intelligence to create links, develop
   semantic metaphors and models for reasoning; construct rules for
   decision making; and to form bounded loops for interaction,
   socialization and knowledge sharing. But machines are inadequate with
   these extraordinary abilities rather, numerous algorithms and
   mathematical models can be used to connect physical resources with
   cyberspaces to control objects and, develop cognitive learning for
   optimal decision making. Connected users and devices in closed virtual
   and physical proximity give direction towards the plethora of real-world
   applications for physical, social and, cyber computing. Because of the
   increase in social media networking and 5G communication links offer
   real-time crowdsourcing and sensing as a complementary base for
   information. Proceeding this idea, in this study we have proposed
   Cyber-Physical and Social Networks (CPSN) for two fundamental operations
   in IoV (Internet of Vehicles) as CPSN-IoV; (1) to define conceptual
   architecture of CPSN-IoV for data-oriented network for smart
   infrastructure and, (2) to create the significant virtual space where
   the instances of smart vehicles, devices, and things will have
   meaningful links with the real world objects where, CPSN-IoV will
   evolve, emerge, compete, and collaborate with all connected objects to
   strengthen the decision making process. To investigate the potential
   impact of our proposed study, we have simulated the taxicab trajectory
   data of the urban city of Portugal in OMNeT++ for the in-depth
   understanding of road topology, connected vehicles and things, and their
   traffic trends; and users' social media streams in respective edge for
   efficient route planning. The results of simulation demonstrate that our
   proposed framework has the ability to achieve human-machine intellectual
   association for managing the smart environment.

AB The construction industry is a major contributor to environmental
   degradation and is responsible for substantial energy consumption,
   carbon emissions, and resource depletion. In response, the adoption of
   advanced technologies, like Digital Twins (DT), has emerged as a
   critical strategy to address these sustainability challenges. DTs create
   virtual replicas of physical assets, enabling real-time monitoring,
   optimisation, and informed decision-making, thus enhancing
   sustainability by improving building performance and energy efficiency
   while reducing waste. This study explores the application of DT
   technology in promoting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions
   within the construction industry. It aims to provide a comprehensive
   overview of current DT implementations and identify key challenges to
   broader adoption. Using a combination of scientometric analysis and
   systematic literature review, the study examines the potential of DT to
   address environmental sustainability in construction while highlighting
   areas for future research and development. The analysis reveals
   increasing interest in DTs, with a rise in publications from 2018 to
   2024, led by Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania. The literature
   shows a strong focus on integrating DT with building information
   modeling (BIM) to optimise energy use and achieve sustainability goals
   across a building's lifecycle. However, challenges remain, including
   data integration issues, a lack of standardised protocols, and the need
   for a more skilled workforce. By addressing challenges and enhancing
   DT-BIM integration, the construction industry can minimise its
   environmental impact and progress towards sustainability. The study's
   findings offer vital insights for future research and industry practices
   to meet global sustainability targets effectively.

AB Purpose
   Creating a real-time data integration when developing an
   internet-of-things (IoT)-based warehouse is still faced with challenges.
   It involves a diverse knowledge of novel technology and skills. This
   study aims to identify the critical components of the real-time data
   integration processes in IoT-based warehousing. Then, design and apply a
   data integration framework, adopting the IoT concept to enable real-time
   data transfer and sharing.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study used a pilot experiment to verify the data integration system
   configuration. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology was
   selected to support the integration process in this study, as it is one
   of the most recognized products of IoT.
   Findings
   The experimentations' results proved that data integration plays a
   significant role in structuring a combination of assorted data on the
   IoT-based warehouse from various locations in a real-time manner. This
   study concluded that real-time data integration processes in IoT-based
   warehousing could be generated into three significant components:
   configuration, databasing and transmission.
   Research limitations/implications
   While the framework in this research was carried out in one of the
   developing counties, this study's findings could be used as a foundation
   for future research in a smart warehouse, IoT and related topics. The
   study provides guidelines for practitioners to design a low-cost
   IoT-based smart warehouse system to obtain more accurate and timely data
   to support the quick decision-making process.
   Originality/value
   The research at hand provides the groundwork for researchers to explore
   the proposed theoretical framework and develop it further to increase
   inventory management efficiency of warehouse operations. Besides, this
   study offers an economical alternate for an organization to implement
   the integration software reasonably.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine how the implementation
   of edge computing can enhance the progress of the circular economy
   within supply chains and to address the challenges and best practices
   associated with this emerging technology. Design/methodology/approach -
   This study utilized a streamlined evaluation technique that employed
   Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling for thorough content analysis.
   Extensive searches were conducted among prominent publishers, including
   IEEE, Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, MDPI and Hindawi, utilizing pertinent
   keywords associated with edge computing, circular economy,
   sustainability and supply chain. The search process yielded a total of
   103 articles, with the keywords being searched specifically within the
   titles or abstracts of these articles. Findings - There has been a
   notable rise in the volume of scholarly articles dedicated to edge
   computing in the circular economy and supply chain management. After
   conducting a thorough examination of the published papers, three main
   research themes were identified, focused on technology, optimization and
   circular economy and sustainability. Edge computing adoption in supply
   chains results in a more responsive, efficient and agile supply chain,
   leading to enhanced decision-making capabilities and improved customer
   satisfaction. However, the adoption also poses challenges, such as data
   integration, security concerns, device management, connectivity and
   cost. Originality/value - This paper offers valuable insights into the
   research trends of edge computing in the circular economy and supply
   chains, highlighting its significant role in optimizing supply chain
   operations and advancing the circular economy by processing and
   analyzing real time data generated by the internet of Things, sensors
   and other state-of-the-art tools and devices.

AB Rapid advances in infrastructure health monitoring and sensing
   technologies allow the monitoring of infrastructure assets continuously
   and in real-time throughout their life span. However, smart and
   automated techniques for decision-making (e.g. maintaining or improving
   infrastructure performance) are in their infancy. The revolution in new
   sensing capabilities has led to rapidly increasing volumes of data,
   which makes traditional data analysis techniques inadequate. Adoption of
   Big Data (BD) analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are
   urgently needed to automatically integrate information from multiple
   sensors, extract knowledge and inform decision-making. The objective of
   this work was to provide a state-of-the-art review of data fusion and
   machine learning techniques applied to infrastructure health monitoring.
   In contrast to the previously published, related review articles, the
   focus of this review is on the techniques implemented by machine
   learning algorithms, their applications at each data processing stage in
   a machine learning framework, and their advantages and limitations.
   Finally, challenges and future trends for machine learning techniques
   and infrastructure health monitoring systems are discussed. As a review,
   this paper offers meaningful suggestions for employing data fusion and
   machine learning techniques in infrastructure health monitoring.

AB Despite the wide availability of remote sensing big data from numerous
   different Earth Observation (EO) instruments, the limitations in the
   spatial and temporal resolution of such EO sensors (as well as
   atmospheric opacity and other kinds of interferers) have led to many
   situations in which using only remote sensing data cannot fully meet the
   requirements of applications in which a (near) real-time response is
   needed. Examples of these applications include floods, earthquakes, and
   other kinds of natural disasters, such as typhoons. To address this
   issue, social media data have gradually been adopted to fill possible
   gaps in the analysis when remote sensing data are lacking or incomplete.
   In this case, the fusion of heterogeneous big data streams from multiple
   data sources introduces significant demands from a computational
   viewpoint. In order to meet these challenges, distributed computing is
   increasingly viewed as a feasible solution to parallelize the analysis
   of massive data coming from different sources (e.g., remote sensing and
   social media data). In this article, we provide an overview of available
   and new distributed strategies to address the computational challenges
   brought by massive heterogeneous data processing and fusion for
   real-time environmental monitoring and decision-making. The 2013 Boulder
   (Colorado) flood event is taken as a case study to evaluate several new
   distributed data fusion frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the proposed distributed frameworks are suitable in terms of
   response time and computational requirements for fusing large-volume
   heterogeneous data sources.

AB Nowadays, many cities are suffering from air pollution problems, which
   endangered the health of the young and elderly for breathing problems.
   For supporting the government's policy-making and people's decision
   making, it is important to predict future fine-grained air quality. In
   this article, we predict the air quality of the next 48 hours for each
   monitoring station and the daily average air quality of the next 7 days
   for a city, considering air quality data, meteorology data, and weather
   forecast data. Based on the domain knowledge about air pollution, we
   propose a deep neural network based approach, entitled DeepAir. Our
   approach consists of a deep distributed fusion network for station-level
   short-term prediction and a deep cascaded fusion network for the
   city-level long-term forecast. With the data transformation
   preprocessing, the former network adopts a neural distributed
   architecture to fuse heterogeneous urban data for simultaneously
   capturing the direct and indirect factors affecting air quality. The
   latter network takes a neural cascaded architecture to learn the dynamic
   influences from previously existing data and future predicted data on
   future air quality. We have deployed a real-time system on the cloud,
   providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities
   every hour. Our system mainly consists of three components: data
   crawler, task scheduler, and prediction model, which are implemented
   with a multi-task architecture to improve the system's efficiency and
   stability. Based on the datasets from three-year nine Chinese cities,
   experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method.

AB Due to increasing herd sizes and automation on dairy farms there is an
   important need for automated monitoring of cow production, health, and
   welfare. Despite much progress in automatic monitoring techniques, there
   is still a need to integrate data from multiple sources to create a
   comprehensive overview and accurate diagnosis of a cow's state. To aid
   the technological development of data integration, a prototype of an
   open and customizable automatic system that integrates data from
   multiple sensors relating to barn environment and cow behaviour was
   developed. The system integrates data from sensors that measure barn
   climate (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed), air quality (e.g.,
   CO2 concentration), water use and temperature, the moisture and
   temperature of the litter and cow behaviour (e.g., lying, eating,
   ruminating). An external weather system and video recording system are
   also included. The system's architecture consists of four main elements:
   sensors, nodes, gateways, and backend. The data are recorded by sensors,
   then locally processed on custom-developed sensor nodes, and then
   transmitted via radio channels to local gateways that combine the data
   from multiple nodes and transmit them to distributed digital storage
   ("the cloud") via a 3G/4G cellular network. On the cloud, the data are
   further processed and stored in a database. The data are then presented
   to the user continuously and in real time on a dashboard that can be
   accessed via the internet. In the design of the local wireless network,
   care was taken to avoid data packet collision and thus to minimize data
   loss. To test the system's performance, the system was installed and
   operated on three commercial dairy cattle farms for one year. The system
   provided high data stability with minimal loss and outliers, showing
   that the system is reliable and suitable for long term application on
   commercial dairy farms. The system's architecture, communication
   network, and data processing and visualization applications form an open
   framework for research and development purposes, allowing it to be
   customized and fine-tuned before being deployed as a management
   assistant on commercial dairy farms. Missing elements that should be
   added in the future are the integration of the data from the milking
   parlour and cow identification. Algorithms to integrate information from
   multiple sensors can be added to provide a comprehensive system that
   monitors all aspects related to cow welfare, health, and production
   automatically, remotely and in real time, thereby supporting farmers in
   important management decision-making.

AB In current era, DevOps gain much interaction in software industry as it
   provides the flexible development environment. To meet the continuous
   development and operations, DevOps mainly focus, to integrate the data
   from heterogeneous source. While DevOps adoption, the quality assessment
   of data integrated from heterogeneous environment, is important and
   challenging at the same time. This study aims to identify the critical
   factors that could negatively impact the data quality assessment process
   in DevOps. We have used the systematic literature review (SLR) approach
   and identify a total of 13 critical challenging factors. The finding of
   SLR are further validated with industry experts via questionnaire
   survey. Finally, we have applied the Fuzzy TOPSIS approach to prioritize
   the investigated challenging factors with respect to their significance
   of DevOps data quality assessment process. The results show that
   analyzing data in real time, visualization of data and missing
   information and other invalid data are the highest ranked challenging
   factors which need to be addressed on priority basis, to successfully
   measure the quality of heterogeneous data in DevOps. We believe that the
   finding of this study will assist the practitioner to consider the most
   significant factors for measuring the quality of heterogeneous data in
   DevOps.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the
   neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care by leveraging the large-scale,
   high-dimensional data that are generated by NICU patients. There is an
   emerging recognition that the confluence of technological progress,
   commercialization pathways, and rich data sets provides a unique
   opportunity for AI to make a lasting impact on the NICU. In this
   perspective article, we discuss four broad categories of AI applications
   in the NICU: imaging interpretation, prediction modeling of electronic
   health record data, integration of real-time monitoring data, and
   documentation and billing. By enhancing decision-making, streamlining
   processes, and improving patient outcomes, AI holds the potential to
   transform the quality of care for vulnerable newborns, making the
   excitement surrounding AI advancements well-founded and the potential
   for significant positive change stronger than ever before.

AB In this article, a new design of a wearable navigation support system
   for blind and visually impaired people (BVIP) is proposed. The proposed
   navigation system relies primarily on sensors, real-time processing
   boards, a fuzzy logic-based decision support system, and a user
   interface. It uses sensor data as inputs and provides the desired safety
   orientation to the BVIP. The user is informed about the decision based
   on a mixed voice-haptic interface. The navigation aid system contains
   two wearable obstacle detection systems managed by an embedded
   controller. The control system adopts the Robot Operating System (ROS)
   architecture supported by the Beagle Bone Black master board that meets
   the real-time constraints. The data acquisition and obstacle avoidance
   are carried out by several nodes managed by the ROS to finally deliver a
   mixed haptic-voice message for guidance of the BVIP. A fuzzy logic-based
   decision support system was implemented to help BVIP to choose a safe
   direction. The system has been applied to blindfolded persons and
   visually impaired persons. Both types of users found the system
   promising and pointed out its potential to become a good navigation aid
   in the future.

AB The exponential growth of the Internet of Things has precipitated a
   revolution in Intelligent Transportation Systems, notably in urban
   environments. An ITS leverages advancements in communication
   technologies and data analytics to enhance the efficiency and
   intelligence of transport networks. At the same time, these IoT-enabled
   ITSs generate a vast array of complex data classified as Big Data.
   Traditional data analytics frameworks need help to efficiently process
   these Big Data due to its sheer volume, velocity, variety, and
   significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning, known for its
   privacy-preserving attributes, is a promising technology for
   implementation within ITSs for IoT-generated Big Data. Nevertheless, the
   system faces challenges due to the variable nature of devices, the
   heterogeneity of data, and the dynamic conditions in which ITS operates.
   Recent efforts to mitigate these challenges focus on the practical
   selection of an averaging mechanism during the server's aggregation
   phase and practical dynamic client training. Despite these efforts,
   existing research still relies on personalized FL with personalized
   averaging and client training. This paper presents a personalized
   architecture, including an optimized Federated Averaging strategy that
   leverages FL for efficient and real-time Big Data analytics in
   IoT-enabled ITSs. Various personalization methods are applied to enhance
   the traditional averaging algorithm. Local fine-tuning and weighted
   averaging tailor the global model to individual client data. Custom
   learning rates are utilized to boost the performance further. Regular
   evaluations are advised to maintain model efficacy. The proposed
   architecture addresses critical challenges like real-life federated
   environment settings, data integration, and significant data privacy,
   offering a comprehensive solution for modern urban transportation
   systems using Big Data. Using the Udacity Self-Driving Car Dataset foe
   vehicle detection, we apply the proposed approaches to demonstrate the
   efficacy of our model. Our empirical findings validate the superiority
   of our architecture in terms of scalability, real-time decision-making
   capabilities, and data privacy preservation. We attained accuracy levels
   of 93.27%, 92.89%, and 92.96% for our proposed model in a Federated
   Learning architecture with 10 nodes, 20 nodes, and 30 nodes,
   respectively.

AB Robust and prompt emergency response is a crucial service that smart
   cities should provide to citizens, communities, and corporations.
   Emergency management strategies that are currently supported by cities
   yield pre-determined protocols that can only handle well-understood
   incidents. However, there are incidents whose nature, shape, scale, and
   timing are not as predictable. The lack of adequate data management
   platforms to harvest emergency-related data from the proliferation of
   data sources scattered around a city is a major shortfall in current
   emergency response and risk assessment processes. We propose an improved
   information infrastructure to assist emergency personnel in responding
   effectively and proportionally to largescale, distributed, unstructured
   natural and man-made hazards such as multi-vehicle accidents, outbreaks
   of human or animal diseases, major weather events, large fires, and
   terrorist attacks. The proposed infrastructure will crowdsource the
   multitude of human and physical sensing resources that can generate data
   about incidents (e. g. smartphones, sensors, vehicles, etc.) in order to
   build a comprehensive understanding of emergency situations and provide
   situational awareness and recommendations to emergency teams on the
   scene. Our infrastructure consists of three components: (1) large-scale
   crowdsensing and data quality valuation, (2) heterogeneous data
   integration and analytics, and (3) decision making, alternative
   generation and recommendations. Leveraging crowdsensing and
   heterogeneous data analytics will improve the response coordination to
   critical incidents and realtime incident management, which will
   contribute to saving lives and reducing injuries, improving the quality
   of life, and saving resources by deploying them more effectively.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have revolutionized
   transportation by incorporating advanced technologies for efficient and
   safe mobility. However, these systems face challenges ensuring security
   and resilience against adversarial attacks. This research addresses
   these challenges and introduces a novel Dampster-Shafer data
   fusion-based Adversarial Deep Learning (DS-ADL) Model for ITS in fog
   cloud environments. Our proposed model focuses on three levels of
   adversarial attacks: original image level, feature level, and decision
   level. Adversarial examples are generated at each level to evaluate the
   system's vulnerability comprehensively. To enhance the system's
   capabilities, we leverage the power of several vital components.
   Firstly, we employ Dempster-Shafer-based Multimodal Sensor Fusion,
   enabling the fusion of information from multiple sensors for improved
   scene understanding. This fusion approach enhances the system's
   perception and decision-making abilities. For feature extraction and
   classification, we utilize ResNet 101, a deep learning architecture
   known for its effectiveness in computer vision tasks. We introduced a
   novel Monomodal Multidimensional Gaussian Model (MMGM-DD) based
   Adversarial Detection approach to detect adversarial examples. This
   detection mechanism enhances the system's ability to identify and
   mitigate adversarial attacks in real-time. Additionally, we incorporate
   the Defensive Distillation method for adversarial training, which trains
   the model to be robust against attacks by exposing it to adversarial
   examples during the training process. To evaluate the performance of our
   proposed model, we utilize two datasets: Google Speech Command version
   0.01 and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).
   Evaluation metrics include latency delay and computation time
   (fog-cloud), accuracy, MSE, loss, and F-score for attack detection and
   defense. The results and discussions demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our Dampster-Shafer data fusion-based Adversarial Deep Learning Model in
   enhancing the robustness and security of ITS in fog-cloud environments.
   The model's ability to detect and defend against adversarial attacks
   while maintaining low-latency fog-cloud operations highlights its
   potential for real-world deployment in ITS.

AB Digital Twin (DT) technology is transforming industrial systems by
   integrating physical assets with digital models, enabling real-time
   monitoring, predictive analytics, and process optimization, particularly
   within the framework of Industry 4.0 (I4.0). As the global industrial
   landscape shifts toward Industry 5.0 (I5.0), DTs are increasingly being
   redefined to support human-centric innovation, sustainability, and
   system resilience. This review examines the evolving role of DTs in
   bridging the efficiency-driven goals of I4.0 with the inclusive,
   sustainable objectives of I5.0. It explores ten enabling technologies
   such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things, blockchain,
   cloud and edge computing, and extended reality, while discussing both
   the opportunities and challenges posed by I5.0. The study emphasizes key
   principles of DTs, including real-time synchronization, feedback
   mechanisms, and lifecycle integration. A detailed sectorial analysis
   across manufacturing, infrastructure, energy, transportation, mining,
   agriculture, and healthcare illustrates how DTs are being applied in
   diverse contexts to enhance operational efficiency, product quality, and
   decision-making. The mapping of applications by country, sector, and
   industrial focus reveals growing trends toward I5.0 in areas such as
   logistics and infrastructure. Common application domains include
   monitoring, optimization, prediction, and decision support. Despite
   their potential, DT adoption faces challenges including high
   implementation costs, data integration issues, cybersecurity concerns,
   and lack of standardization. The review discusses these barriers
   alongside the importance of validation and security for trusted
   deployment. It concludes by identifying future directions, including
   cognitive twins, industrial metaverse integration, and ethical AI. DTs
   are positioned as foundational technologies for advancing sustainable,
   resilient, and human-centered industrial systems.

   advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
   capabilities to enhance these networks. We outline the current
   architecture of ISATNs and highlight the significant role LLMs can play
   in optimizing data flow, signal processing, and network management to
   advance 5G/6G communication technologies through advanced predictive
   algorithms and real-time decision-making. A comprehensive analysis of
   ISATN components is conducted, assessing how LLMs can effectively

   paper delves into the network management challenges within ISATNs,
   emphasizing the necessity for sophisticated resource allocation
   strategies, traffic routing, and security management to ensure seamless
   connectivity and optimal performance under varying conditions.
   Furthermore, we examine the technical challenges and limitations
   associated with integrating LLMs into ISATNs, such as data integration
   for LLM processing, scalability issues, latency in decision-making
   processes, and the design of robust, fault-tolerant systems. The study
   also identifies critical future research directions for fully harnessing
   LLM capabilities in ISATNs, which is important for enhancing network
   reliability, optimizing performance, and achieving a truly

AB The necessity of developing sufficient systems to monitor health
   conditions has increased due to the aging of the population and the
   prevalence of chronic diseases, creating a demand for remote health care
   systems that make use of biosensors. This article proposes an
   energy-saving multisensor data sampling and fusion with decision-making
   for the monitoring of patient health risk in wireless body sensor
   networks (WBSNs). The work consists of three steps: energy-efficient
   sampling rate adaptation, multisensor data fusion, and decision-making.
   The sampling is performed in each biosensor and it adapts its rate based
   on the local risk and the global risk in which global risk computed at
   the coordinator, where the data is fused afterward. Finally, decisions
   are made according to the risk level of the patient. The processing of
   these functions enables in real-time the adoption of the biosensor
   sampling rates based on the dynamic risk level of each biosensor, and a
   corresponding decision is made whenever an emergency is detected. The
   performance of the suggested approach is evaluated using actual health
   datasets, and some of its aspects are put into comparison with an
   existing approach, such as the data reducing and energy-consuming rates.
   The acquired results illustrate a decrease in the volume of gathered
   data, thus a significant energy saving has been made while preserving
   data accuracy and integrity. Moreover, presenting a data fusing model at
   the coordinator level by means of an early warning score system has
   assessed the health condition of patients and took an appropriate
   decision when detecting emergencies.

AB With the advancement of Agriculture 4.0 and the ongoing transition
   toward sustainable and intelligent agricultural systems, deep
   learning-based multimodal fusion technologies have emerged as a driving
   force for crop monitoring, plant management, and resource conservation.
   This article systematically reviews research progress from three
   perspectives: technical frameworks, application scenarios, and
   sustainability-driven challenges. At the technical framework level, it
   outlines an integrated system encompassing data acquisition, feature
   fusion, and decision optimization, thereby covering the full pipeline of

   integration enhances precision and efficiency in sustainable farming
   operations. It further discusses the efficient translation of detection
   outcomes into eco-friendly field practices through agricultural

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming
   thoracic surgery by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, surgical precision,
   intraoperative guidance, and postoperative management. AI-driven
   technologies, including machine learning (ML), deep learning, computer
   vision, and robotic-assisted surgery, have the potential to optimize
   clinical workflows and improve patient outcomes. However, challenges
   such as data integration, ethical concerns, and regulatory barriers must
   be addressed to ensure AI's safe and effective implementation. This
   review aims to analyze the current applications, benefits, limitations,
   and future directions of AI in thoracic surgery. Methods: This review
   was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive
   literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science,
   and Cochrane Library for studies published up to January 2025. Relevant
   articles were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion
   criteria, focusing on AI applications in thoracic surgery, including
   diagnostics, robotic-assisted surgery, intraoperative guidance, and
   postoperative care. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the
   Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies.
   Results: Out of 279 identified studies, 36 met the inclusion criteria
   for qualitative synthesis, highlighting AI's growing role in diagnostic
   accuracy, surgical precision, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative
   care in thoracic surgery. AI-driven imaging analysis and radiomics have
   improved pulmonary nodule detection, lung cancer classification, and
   lymph node metastasis prediction, while robotic-assisted thoracic
   surgery (RATS) has enhanced surgical accuracy, reduced operative times,
   and improved recovery rates. Intraoperatively, AI-powered image-guided
   navigation, augmented reality (AR), and real-time decision-support
   systems have optimized surgical planning and safety. Postoperatively,
   AI-driven predictive models and wearable monitoring devices have enabled
   early complication detection and improved patient follow-up. However,
   challenges remain, including algorithmic biases, a lack of multicenter
   validation, high implementation costs, and ethical concerns regarding
   data security and clinical accountability. Despite these limitations, AI
   has shown significant potential to enhance surgical outcomes, requiring
   further research and standardized validation for widespread adoption.
   Conclusions: AI is poised to revolutionize thoracic surgery by enhancing
   decision-making, improving patient outcomes, and optimizing surgical
   workflows. However, widespread adoption requires addressing key
   limitations through multicenter validation studies, standardized AI
   frameworks, and ethical AI governance. Future research should focus on
   digital twin technology, federated learning, and explainable AI (XAI) to
   improve AI interpretability, reliability, and accessibility. With
   continued advancements and responsible integration, AI will play a
   pivotal role in shaping the next generation of precision thoracic
   surgery.

AB The Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) methodology offers a
   promising solution to achieve a sustainable built environment by
   simultaneously considering all sustainability pillars. However,
   traditional LCSA applications are typically confined to the early design
   stages of building projects, where they assess the entire life cycle of
   a building using static historical data rather than being employed as a
   decision-making tool throughout all project phases with real-time data
   integration. This research addresses these limitations by investigating
   the integration of LCSA with Digital Twin (DT) and Blockchain
   technologies to enhance sustainability assessments in building projects.
   The primary aim is to develop a dynamic framework that incorporates
   realtime data across a building's entire life cycle. This study utilizes
   a systematic literature review to identify current trends and gaps,
   leading to the development of an integrative framework validated through
   a case study of a typical residential building. The findings demonstrate
   that integrating DT facilitates continuous monitoring and assessment of
   environmental, economic, and social impacts, while Blockchain ensures
   data security, integrity, and transparency. This novel approach supports
   real-time, iterative LCSA applications, enhancing decision-making from
   design through construction and maintenance. By showcasing a practical
   application of DT and Blockchain in real-world scenarios, this framework
   significantly advances sustainable practices in construction. The
   originality of this research lies in its holistic approach, combining DT
   and Blockchain to deliver a more accurate, reliable, and comprehensive
   sustainability assessment model, setting a new standard for future
   developments in the field.

AB This report presents the key talking points in the First Workshop on the
   Future of Machine Learning in Geotechnics (FOMLIG), that include data
   infrastructure, geotechnical context, computational cost, and human
   judgment. On the first point, it was argued that further growth in data
   sharing needs stronger demonstration of value to practice and protection
   of data privacy. On the second point, significant progress has been made
   in addressing site specificity (site recognition challenge). On the
   third point, it is costly to interpret monitoring data in the context of
   machine learning guided observational method (MLOM) because the 3D
   domain influencing the geotechnical structure is large, real-time
   dataset is very large and its attributes are complicated, data fusion
   remains challenging, and computation speed must support real-time
   decision making. Real-time machine learning-based decision support is
   clearly not useful if it is not providing the engineer with sufficient
   lead time to adjust the construction process. On the fourth point, the
   capability of generative AIs such as ChatGPT to act as an intelligent
   companion to an engineer in decision making is exciting. The role of
   human judgment in human-machine teaming is unclear, but for
   human-machine teaming to be effective, a deliberate approach is needed
   to build trust between the human and the AI/robot partner.

AB Construction work typically means producing on shifting locations.
   Moving materials, equipment and men efficiently from place to place, in
   and in between projects, depends on good coordination and requires
   specialized information systems. The key to such information systems are
   appropriate approaches to collect de-centralized sensor readings and to
   process, and distribute them to multiple end users at different
   locations both during the construction process and after the project is
   finished. This paper introduces a framework for the support of such
   distributed data collection and management to foster real-time data
   collection and processing along with the provision of opportunities to
   retain highly precise data for post-process analyses. In particular, the
   framework suggests a scheme to benefit from exploiting readings from the
   same sensors in varying levels of detail for informing different levels
   of decision making: operational, tactical, and strategic. The sensor
   readings collected in this way are not only potentially useful to track,
   assess, and analyse construction operations, but can also serve as
   reference during the maintenance stage. To this extent, the framework
   contributes to the existing body of knowledge of construction
   informatics. The operationality of the framework is demonstrated by
   developing and applying two on site information systems to track asphalt
   paving operations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Today, the Web is the largest source of information worldwide. There is
   currently a strong trend for decision-making applications such as Data
   Warehousing (DW) and Business Intelligence (BI) to move onto the Web,
   especially in the cloud. Integrating data into DW/BI applications is a
   critical and time-consuming task. To make better decisions in DW/BI
   applications, next generation data integration poses new requirements to
   data integration systems, over those posed by traditional data
   integration. In this paper, we propose a generic, metadata-based,
   service-oriented, and event-driven approach for integrating Web data
   timely and autonomously. Beside handling data heterogeneity,
   distribution and interoperability, our approach satisfies near real-time
   requirements and realize active data integration. For this sake, we
   design and develop a framework that utilizes Web standards (e.g., XML
   and Web services) for tackling data heterogeneity, distribution and
   interoperability issues. Moreover, our framework utilizes Active XML
   (AXML) to warehouse passive data as well as services to integrate active
   and dynamic data on-the-fly. AXML embedded services and changes
   detection services ensure near real-time data integration. Furthermore,
   the idea of integrating Web data actively and autonomously revolves
   around mining events logged by the data integration environment.
   Therefore, we propose an incremental XML-based algorithm for mining
   association rules from logged events. Then, we define active rules
   dynamically upon mined data to automate and reactivate integration
   tasks. Finally, as a proof of concept, we implement a framework
   prototype as a Web application using open-source tools.

AB Digital Twin (DT) technology has evolved to contextualize real-time
   interactions between the physical and digital worlds. It has gained
   increasing attention in various research areas and industries, including
   the manufacturing, aerospace, and automotive industries, while facing
   challenges in processing and analyzing large datasets. To address these
   challenges, this paper proposes an edge computing-based DT (E-DT)
   framework and elaborates on its functional and informational aspects.
   The functional aspect is represented using ISO 23247 as the reference
   architecture, while the informational aspect is elaborated by
   introducing a data fusion model. Then, an E-DT for Wire+Arc Additive
   Manufacturing (WAAM) is developed, its performance is evaluated, and the
   benefits of edge computing in enhancing real-time processing and
   decision-making are verified. In addition, a typical non-edge
   computing-based DT for WAAM is implemented according to ISO 23237 for
   comparison. The results show that the proposed E-DT for WAAM achieved
   reduction in latency through faster data processing, smaller data upload
   volume, and more consistent data upload speed.

AB In the era of Industry 4.0 and the digital transformation of the
   manufacturing sector, this article explores the significant potential of
   machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in evaluating
   surface roughness-a critical metric of product quality. The integration
   of edge computing with current computational resources and intelligent
   sensors has revolutionized the application of AI-driven algorithms in
   smart manufacturing. It provides real-time data analysis and
   decision-making capabilities that were unattainable only a decade ago.
   The research effort intends to improve data-driven decision-making for
   product quality evaluation by leveraging data integration from
   manufacturing operations and surface quality measurements. Although a
   substantial amount of research has been conducted in the related fields,
   it is still difficult to comprehend and compile all the data on surface
   roughness research predictive assessment in the form of a process
   pipeline. This thorough systematic analysis examines scholarly articles
   published between 2014 and 2024 focusing on surface roughness assessment
   in precision manufacturing settings. The article is thoroughly
   classified based on the manufacturing processes, datasets, and ML models
   used, giving light on the present status, prominent approaches, and
   existing issues in this sector. A table summarizing the relevant works
   in this domain providing an easy access to the current trends have been
   provided. The article not only compiles essential findings and
   identifies research gaps and similarities in existing methodologies, but
   it also discusses future research directions and open issues in AI-aided
   surface roughness evaluation. The critical analysis of the literature
   reveals a scientific gaps which includes consistent development of
   benchmarked datasets and making the AI models more explainable using the
   state-of-the-art explainable AI (XAI) algorithms. The ultimate objective
   of the article is not only to provide a guide for the practitioners in
   either of the three domains of AI, manufacturing or surface metrology
   but also to pave the path for more robust, efficient, and accurate
   surface quality evaluation processes in production.

AB Wildfires are expected to increase in number, extent, and severity due
   to climate change. Hence, it is ever more important to integrate
   technological developments and scientific knowledge into fire management
   aiming at protecting lives, infrastructure, and the environment. In this
   paper, a decision support system (DSS) adapted to the Portuguese context
   and based on multi-sensor technologies and geographic information system
   (GIS) functionalities is proposed to leverage operational data, enabling
   faster and more informed decisions to reduce the impact of wildfires.
   Here we present a flexible and reconfigurable DSS composed of three
   components: an ArcGIS online feature service that provides operational
   data and enables a collaborative environment of users that share
   operational data in near real-time; a mobile client application to
   interact with the system, enabling the use of GIS technology and
   visualization dashboards; and a multi-sensor device that collects field
   data providing value to external services. The design and validation of
   this system benefitted from the feedback of wildfire management
   specialists and a partnership with an end-user in the municipality of
   Macao that also helped establish the system requirements. The validation
   results demonstrated that a robust system was achieved with fully
   interoperable components that fulfill the defined system requirements.

AB Digital agriculture, with the incorporation of Internet-of-Things
   (IoT)-based technologies, presents the ability to control a system at
   multiple levels (individual, local, regional, and global) and generates
   tools that allow for improved decision making and higher productivity.
   Recent advances in IoT hardware, e.g., networks of heterogeneous
   embedded devices, and software, e.g., lightweight computer vision
   algorithms and cloud optimization solutions, make it possible to
   efficiently process data from diverse sources in a connected (smart)
   farm. By interconnecting these IoT devices, often across large
   geographical distances, it is possible to collect data at different time
   scales, including in near real-time (i.e., with delays of only a few
   tens of seconds). This data can then be used for actionable insights,
   e.g., precise applications of soil supplements and reduced environmental
   footprint. Through LATTICE, we present an integrated vision for IoT
   solutions, data processing, and actionable analytics for digital
   agriculture. We couple this with discussion of economics and policy
   considerations that will underlie adoption of such IoT and ML
   technologies. Our paper starts off with the types of datasets in typical
   field operations, followed by the lifecycle for the data and storage,
   cloud and edge analytics, and fast information-retrieval solutions. We
   discuss what algorithms are proving to be most impactful in this space,
   e.g., approximate data analytics and on-device/in-network processing. We
   conclude by discussing analytics for alternative agriculture for
   generation of biofuels and policy challenges in the implementation of
   digital agriculture in the wild.

AB The goal of multimodality neuromonitoring is to provide continuous,
   real-time assessment of brain physiology to prevent, detect, and
   attenuate secondary brain injury. Clinical informatics deals with
   biomedical data, information, and knowledge including their acquisition,
   storage, retrieval, and optimal use for clinical decision-making. An
   electronic literature search was conducted for English language articles
   describing the use of informatics in the intensive care unit setting
   from January 1990 to August 2013. A total of 64 studies were included in
   this review. Clinical informatics infrastructure should be adopted that
   enables a wide range of linear and nonlinear analytical methods be
   applied to patient data. Specific time epochs of clinical interest
   should be reviewable. Analysis strategies of monitor alarms may help
   address alarm fatigue. Ergonomic data display that present results from
   analyses with clinical information in a sensible uncomplicated manner
   improve clinical decision-making. Collecting and archiving the highest
   resolution physiologic and phenotypic data in a comprehensive open
   format data warehouse is a crucial first step toward information
   management and two-way translational research for multimodality
   monitoring. The infrastructure required is largely the same as that
   needed for telemedicine intensive care applications, which under the
   right circumstances improves care quality while reducing cost.

AB Mega-facility management has long been inefficient due to manual,
   reactive approaches. Current facility management systems face challenges
   such as fragmented data integration, limited predictive systems, use of
   traditional methods, and lack of knowledge of new technologies, such as
   Building Information Modeling and Artificial Intelligence. This study
   examines the transformative integration of Artificial Intelligence and
   Digital Twin technologies into Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   frameworks using IoT sensors for real-time data collection and
   predictive analytics. Unlike previous research, this study uses case
   studies and simulation models for dynamic data integration and
   scenario-based analyses. Key findings show a significant reduction in
   maintenance costs (25%) and energy consumption (20%), as well as
   increased asset utilization and operational efficiency. With an F1-score
   of more than 90%, the system shows excellent predictive accuracy for
   equipment failures and energy forecasting. Practical applications in
   hospitals and airports demonstrate the developed ability of the platform
   to integrate the Internet of Things and Building Information Modeling
   technologies, shifting facilities management from being reactive to
   proactive. This paper presents a demo platform that integrates BIM with
   Digital Twins to improve the predictive maintenance of HVAC systems,
   equipment, security systems, etc., by recording data from different
   assets, which helps streamline asset management, enhance energy
   efficiency, and support decision-making for the buildings' critical
   systems.

AB Digital twins (DTs) are highly valuable tools for urban planning as they
   provide a virtual replica of the physical city, integrating real-time
   data and simulations to enhance the decision-making and management
   processes. The use of DTs expands the possibilities for data integration
   and visualization in urban contexts. This includes real-time data
   measurements from multiple sources, such as sensors and IoT devices,
   facilitating comprehensive insights. DT's virtual representation helps
   authorities and planners visualize urban dynamics and improve their
   understanding of urban ecosystems, energy efficiency, traffic
   management, emergency response, and more. DT supports the simulation and
   modeling of different scenarios in an urban built environment, enabling
   the predictive analysis of transformation decisions and the anticipation
   of future trends and challenges. This paper highlights the assumptions
   and ongoing progress in the development of a DT for the city of Turin
   (Italy), focusing on a range of applications, such as the extraction of
   built and natural environment features, land use data, road network and
   pavement quality, and signage, along with continuous model updates over

AB The evaluation of community livability quantifies the demands of human
   settlement at the micro scale, supporting urban governance
   decision-making at the macro scale. Big data generated by the urban
   management of government agencies can provide an accurate, real-time,
   and rich data set for livability evaluation. However, these data are
   intertwined by overlapping geographical management boundaries of
   different government agencies. It causes the difficulty of data
   integration and utilization when evaluating community livability. To
   address this problem, this paper proposes a scheme of partitioning basic
   geographical space into grids by optimally integrating various
   geographical management boundaries relevant to enterprise-level big
   data. Furthermore, the system of indexes on community livability is
   created, and the evaluation model of community livability is
   constructed. Taking Wuhan as an example, the effectiveness of the model
   is verified. After the evaluation, the experimental results show that
   the livability evaluation with reference to our basic geographic grids
   can effectively make use of governmental big data to spatially identify
   the multi-dimensional characteristics of a community, including
   management, environment, facility services, safety, and health. Our
   technical solution to evaluate community livability using gridded basic
   urban geographical data is of large potential in producing thematic data
   of community, constructing a 15-min community living circle of Wuhan,
   and enhancing the ability of the community to resist risks.

AB Dynamic flood disaster simulation is an emerging and promising
   technology significantly useful in urban planning, risk assessment, and
   integrated decision support systems. It is still an important issue to
   integrate the large assets such as dynamic observational data, numerical
   flood simulation models, geographic information technologies, and
   computing resources into a unified framework. For the intended end user,
   it is also a holistic solution to create computer interpretable
   representations and gain insightful understanding of the dynamic
   disaster processes, the complex impacts, and interactions of disaster
   factors. In particular, it is still difficult to access and join
   harmonized data, processing algorithms, and models that are provided by
   different environmental information infrastructures. In this paper, we
   demonstrate a virtual geographic environments-based integrated
   environmental simulation framework for flood disaster management based
   on the notion of interlinked resources, which is capable of automated
   accumulating and manipulating of sensor data, creating dynamic
   geo-analysis and three-dimensional visualizations of ongoing
   geo-process, and updating the contents of simulation models representing
   the real environment. The prototype system is evaluated by applying it
   as a proof of concept to integrate in situ weather observations,
   numerical weather and flood disaster simulation models, visualization,
   and analysis of the real time flood event. Case applications indicate
   that the developed framework can be adopted for use by decision-makers
   for short-term planning and control since the resulting simulation and
   visualization are completely based on the latest status of environment.

AB The array of complex and evolving patient data has limited clinical
   decision making in the emergency department (ED). This study introduces
   an advanced deep learning algorithm designed to enhance real-time
   prediction accuracy for integration into a novel Clinical Decision
   Support System (CDSS). A retrospective study was conducted using data
   from a level 1 tertiary hospital. The algorithm's predictive performance
   was evaluated based on in-hospital cardiac arrest, inotropic circulatory
   support, advanced airway, and intensive care unit admission. We
   developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for CDSS that
   integrates multiple data modalities, including vitals, laboratory, and
   imaging results from electronic health records. The AI model was trained
   and tested on a dataset of 237,059 ED visits. The algorithm's
   predictions, based solely on triage information, significantly
   outperformed traditional logistic regression models, with notable
   improvements in the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).
   Additionally, predictive accuracy improved with the inclusion of
   continuous data input at shorter intervals. This study suggests the
   feasibility of using AI algorithms in diverse clinical scenarios,
   particularly for earlier detection of clinical deterioration. Future
   work should focus on expanding the dataset and enhancing real-time data
   integration across multiple centers to further optimize its application
   within the novel CDSS.

AB Effective water management is crucial in urban and rural settings,
   requiring efficient usage and timely detection of issues like leakages
   for sustainability. This paper introduces an integrated framework that
   combines Digital Twin technology with a multimodal transformer-based
   model for accurate water usage prediction and leakage detection. The
   system synchronizes real-time data from various sensors including flow
   meters, pressure sensors, and thermal imaging devices with a Digital
   Twin of the water network. Advanced transformer models, specifically the
   Informer model for long-term time-series prediction and a Water
   Multimodal Transformer for anomaly detection, process these data to
   capture complex patterns and dependencies. Experimental results
   demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: the Informer model achieved
   an R2 score of 0.9995 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 2.2,
   outperforming traditional models. For leakage detection, the model
   attained 98.4% accuracy and precision, an F1 score of 97.6%, a low False
   Positive Rate of 0.0019, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.984. By
   fusing diverse sensor data and utilizing advanced transformer
   architectures, the framework provides a comprehensive view of the water
   network, enabling real-time decision-making, enhancing forecasting
   accuracy, and reducing water waste. This scalable solution supports
   sustainable water management practices in both urban and industrial

AB Detecting the breakdown of industrial IoT devices is a major challenge.
   Despite these challenges, real-time sensor data from the industrial
   internet of things (IIoT) present several advantages, such as the

   from the IIoT can be processed, fused with other data sources, and used
   for rapid decision-making. The study also discusses how to manage
   denoising, missing data imputation, and outlier discovery using
   preprocessing. After that, data fusion techniques like the direct fusion
   technique are used to combine the cleaned sensor data. Fault detection
   in the IIoT can be accomplished by using a variety of deep learning

AB Healthcare facilities need to ensure providing safer services to
   patients without interruptions since disease diagnosis and treatments
   highly depend on medical equipment and spaces. Therefore, facility
   management (FM) of healthcare facilities requires a clear and rapid
   information flow for decision making processes to impede possible
   interruptions. Non-availability of information, accuracy problems and
   incomplete information induce more severe problems such as cost
   overruns, reduced productivity and decrease in customer satisfaction.
   Thus, this paper aims to develop a strategic information taxonomy
   framework for FM inquiries in healthcare facilities to address the
   research problem. Design Science Research methodology cycles such as
   relevance, rigor and design are adopted during the flow of the research.
   In the relevance cycle, research requirements and the importance of
   FMITs were firstly observed with two scenarios, then in the rigor cycle,
   64 FM information types (FMITs) were determined, classified and refined
   under three categories such as; managerial, technical, and financial as
   a result of literature review and pilot study. Determined FMITs were
   analyzed with newly developed MonteCarlo Simulation and TOPSIS
   Techniques on healthcare facilities. As a result of analysis, 62 FMITs
   were found important for healthcare facilities. The most important FM
   Informations Types were found as "identification of hazardous or other
   risks to people or property" (0,985), "real-time operation
   parameters/post occupancy data integration" (0,939), and "predicted
   lifetime of assets" (0,818) in managerial, technical and financial
   information types respectively. Finally, in design cycle, facility
   management information taxonomy, which was created from determined
   FMITs, and importance levels of determined FMITs were evaluated with two
   case studies. Results showed that while maintenance contracts have a
   positive impact to prevent negative impact of costs, they can cause
   interruption in information management in facility management.
   Additionally, there are some view difference in professions. For
   example, construction management literature focuses wastes that are
   incurred at the end of building lifecycle or construction process.
   However, there aren't much attention to manage wastes that occurred
   during operation and maintenance stage. Beside this, regulations and
   standards have importance to store, use and manage FMITs. The analysis
   results acknowledged that the use of information taxonomy framework can
   increase the effectiveness of the healthcare FM.

AB Precision pesticide application is a key focus in orchard management,
   with targeted spraying serving as a core technology to optimize
   pesticide delivery and reduce environmental pollution. However, its
   accurate implementation relies on high-precision environmental sensing
   technologies to enable the precise identification of target objects and
   dynamic regulation of spraying strategies. This paper systematically
   reviews the application of orchard environmental sensing technologies in
   targeted spraying. It first focuses on key sensors used in environmental
   sensing, providing an in-depth analysis of their operational mechanisms
   and advantages in orchard environmental perception. Subsequently, this
   paper discusses the role of multi-source data fusion and artificial
   intelligence analysis techniques in improving the accuracy and stability
   of orchard environmental sensing, supporting crown structure modeling,
   pest and disease monitoring, and weed recognition. Additionally, this
   paper reviews the practical paths of environmental sensing-driven
   targeted spraying technologies, including variable spraying strategies
   based on canopy structure perception, precise pesticide application
   methods combined with intelligent pest and disease recognition, and
   targeted weed control technologies relying on weed and non-target area
   detection. Finally, this paper summarizes the challenges faced by
   multi-source sensing and targeted spraying technologies in light of
   current research progress and industry needs, and explores potential
   future developments in low-cost sensors, real-time data processing,
   intelligent decision making, and unmanned agricultural machinery.

   for versatile deployment platforms. This review overviews how printed
   sensors are used in monitoring soil parameters through electrochemical
   sensing mechanisms, enabling direct measurement of nutrients, moisture
   content, pH value, and others. Notably, printed sensors address
   scalability and cost concerns in fabrication, making them suitable for
   deployment across large crop fields. Additionally, seamlessly
   integrating printed sensors with printed antenna units or traditional
   integrated circuits can facilitate comprehensive functionality for
   real-time data collection and communication. This real-time information
   empowers informed decision-making, optimizes resource management, and
   enhances crop yield. This review aims to provide a comprehensive
   overview of recent work related to printed electrochemical soil sensors,
   ultimately providing insight into future research directions that can
   enable widespread adoption of precision agriculture technologies.

AB With the increasing growth rate of smart home devices and their
   interconnectivity via the Internet of Things (IoT), security threats to
   the communication network have become a concern. This paper proposes a
   learning engine for a smart home communication network that utilizes
   blockchain-based secure communication and a cloud-based data evaluation
   layer to segregate and rank data on the basis of three broad categories
   of Transactions (T), namely Smart T, Mod T, and Avoid T. The learning
   engine utilizes a neural network for the training and classification of
   the categories that helps the blockchain layer with improvisation in the
   decision-making process. The contributions of this paper include the
   application of a secure blockchain layer for user authentication and the
   generation of a ledger for the communication network; the utilization of
   the cloud-based data evaluation layer; the enhancement of an SI-based
   algorithm for training; and the utilization of a neural engine for the
   precise training and classification of categories. The proposed
   algorithm outperformed the Fused Real-Time Sequential Deep Extreme
   Learning Machine (RTS-DELM) system, the data fusion technique, and
   artificial intelligence Internet of Things technology in providing
   electronic information engineering and analyzing optimization schemes in
   terms of the computation complexity, false authentication rate, and
   qualitative parameters with a lower average computation complexity; in
   addition, it ensures a secure, efficient smart home communication
   network to enhance the lifestyle of human beings.

AB To achieve meaningful results, data-driven decision-support systems in
   construction require the integration of fragmented data from multiple
   standalone databases. In practice, a manual brute-force approach is
   often the only available means of integrating structured, yet
   semantically-ambiguous, construction data. Two common data integration
   challenges include the identification of (1) key strings (i.e., product
   identification) partially shared between two data sources; and (2)
   relationships (overlap, included, or outside) between two 3D object
   lists based on coordinates. This research has developed a framework that
   includes two generic solutions to the identified semantic mapping
   challenges. The proposed framework automatically integrates fragmented
   and incompatible data (exhibiting similar semantic mapping challenges)
   from various sources into a tidy format for input into a diverse range
   of industrial construction applications. Verification and functionality
   of the framework were confirmed using both artificial data and a real
   case study of a large oil-and-gas project. The ability of the proposed
   data integration functions and framework to automate otherwise manual
   data integration processes was demonstrated. Results of this study are
   expected to enhance real-time information flow, improve data quality,
   and promote the use of fragmented data for critical decision support in
   practice.

AB This paper discusses the outcome of flight experiments relevant to
   non-cooperative sense and avoid that were carried out in the framework
   of a collaboration between the Italian Aerospace Research Center and the
   University of Naples Federico II. Within the project, aimed at full
   autonomy for medium/large Unmanned Aircraft Systems, an integrated
   radar/electro-optical system configuration was adopted, and real-time
   data fusion/automatic decision-making algorithms were developed to
   estimate intruders' motion, and generate and follow proper escape
   trajectories. All the systems were designed to guarantee collision
   avoidance without any dependence on the command and control link. The
   hardware/software sense and avoid system was installed onboard an
   optionally piloted flying laboratory of Very Light Aircraft category,
   and a single intruder aircraft of the same class was considered for
   avoidance experiments. In particular, the paper focuses on the results
   from radar-based autonomous avoidance flight tests. Performance is
   analyzed in terms of situational awareness before and during the
   maneuver, and effectiveness in performing safe avoidance maneuvers while
   generating smooth commands and minimizing the deviation from nominal
   trajectory. Statistics relevant to several encounters show that in spite
   of a small number of valid sensor measurements, the tracking algorithm
   is able to keep a satisfying level of situational awareness, thus
   enabling safe avoidance. However, the limits deriving from coarse radar
   accuracy, low scan rate, and interaction between mechanical scanning and
   aircraft flight dynamics are also pointed out. While these limits did
   not impact avoidance safety in the considered tests due to the favorable
   operating environment in terms of time to collision, radar detection
   range, and ownship maneuverability, they confirm the need of improved
   sensing concepts in more challenging avoidance scenarios, such as
   adoption of radar/electro-optical data fusion and electronic scanning
   technologies.

AB Rockbursts have become a signi ficant hazard in underground mining,
   underscoring the need for a robust early warning model to ensure safety
   management. This study presents a novel approach for rockburst
   prediction, integrating the Mann -Kendall trend test (MKT) and multi
   -indices fusion to enable real-time and quantitative assessment of
   rockburst hazards. The methodology employed in this study involves the
   development of a comprehensive precursory index library for rockbursts.
   The MKT is then applied to analyze the real-time trend of each index,
   with adherence to rockburst characterization laws serving as the warning
   criterion. By employing a confusion matrix, the warning effectiveness of
   each index is assessed, enabling index preference determination.
   Ultimately, the integrated rockburst hazard index Q is derived through
   data fusion. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
   warning effectiveness of 0.563 for Q , surpassing the performance of any
   individual index. Moreover, the model 's adaptability and scalability
   are enhanced through periodic updates driven by actual field monitoring
   data, making it suitable for complex underground working environments.
   By providing an ef ficient and accurate basis for decision -making, the
   proposed model holds great potential for the prevention and control of
   rockbursts. It offers a valuable tool for enhancing safety measures in
   underground mining operations. (c) 2024 Institute of Rock and Soil

AB With increasingly higher levels of automation in aerospace decision
   support systems, it is imperative that the human operator maintains the
   required level of situational awareness in different operational
   conditions and a central role in the decision-making process. While
   current aerospace systems and interfaces are limited in their
   adaptability, a Cognitive Human Machine System (CHMS) aims to perform
   dynamic, real-time system adaptation by estimating the cognitive states
   of the human operator. Nevertheless, to reliably drive system adaptation
   of current and emerging aerospace systems, there is a need to accurately
   and repeatably estimate cognitive states, particularly for Mental
   Workload (MWL), in real-time. As part of this study, two sessions were
   performed during a Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) scenario,
   including a session for offline calibration and validation and a session
   for online validation of eleven multimodal inference models of MWL. The
   multimodal inference model implemented included an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy
   Inference System (ANFIS), which was used in different configurations to
   fuse data from an Electroencephalogram (EEG) model's output, four eye
   activity features and a control input feature. The online validation of
   the ANFIS models produced good results, while the best performing model
   (containing all four eye activity features and the control input
   feature) showed an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 0.67 +/- 0.18 and
   Correlation Coefficient (CC) = 0.71 +/- 0.15. The remaining six ANFIS
   models included data from the EEG model's output, which had an offset
   discrepancy. This resulted in an equivalent offset for the online
   multimodal fusion. Nonetheless, the efficacy of these ANFIS models could
   be confirmed by the pairwise correlation with the task level, where one
   model demonstrated a CC = 0.77 +/- 0.06, which was the highest among all
   of the ANFIS models tested. Hence, this study demonstrates the
   suitability for online multimodal fusion of features extracted from EEG
   signals, eye activity and control inputs to produce an accurate and
   repeatable inference of MWL.

AB The integration of data science, analytics, and model-based reasoning
   provides a mechanism for enhanced understanding of systems and improved
   decision-making, but its potential has not been thoroughly explored for
   improving the safety and operational efficiency of nuclear power
   reactors. Nuclear power owners, operators, regulators, and researchers
   have made significant investments in probabilistic risk assessments,
   numerical models, computational simulations, and development of
   databases that capture industry-wide component performance and operating
   experience. The nuclear industry is relatively unique in the size,
   variety, scope, technical sophistication, and quality of available data
   and models that capture system performance under normal operations and a
   wide-range of adverse event conditions. However, to date, these
   resources have been used in a largely static and siloed manner. Data
   science, analytics, and model-based reasoning provide a mechanism for
   fusing diverse data sources and models to develop new insights on a
   variety of topics. Of particular interest to the nuclear industry is the
   ability to leverage these resources to enhance the safety and
   operational efficiency of nuclear power reactors.
   In this paper, we present a challenge to the nuclear energy community to
   better leverage the existing investments in data and models to enhance
   decision-making. In particular, we propose that integration of recent
   advances in data science, analytics, and model-based reasoning provides
   a valuable opportunity for the nuclear industry to build upon their
   existing investments by accessing the power of modern data integration
   and risk assessment tools. We begin by describing common data and model
   resources available in nuclear power operations and safety analysis and
   offer commentary on the potential power of using Bayesian networks as a
   structured framework for data fusion and model integration. Then we
   present two example problem structures for modeling risk-informed
   operational decisions using heterogeneous data and models to provide
   simple illustrations of the means by which information streams can be
   leveraged in real-time to provide online assessment of risk and to
   increase diagnostic capabilities. Illustrative model formulations are
   presented for decisions under adverse events and normal operational
   contexts. We conclude by identifying research activities that will
   enable the transformation of decision-making by applying new
   computational and modeling tools to existing data and models.

   and interact with large datasets fused with social feeds in real-time,
   enhanced by a virtual reality (VR) capability, which further promotes
   the knowledge discovery process and allows to interact with urban data
   in natural yet immersive way. A challenge in urban planning is making
   decisions based on datasets which are many times ambiguous, together
   with effective use of newly available yet unstructured sources of
   information like social media. Providing expert users with novel ways of
   representing knowledge can be beneficial for decision making. Game
   engines have evolved into capable testbeds for novel visualization and
   interaction techniques. We therefore explore the possibility of using a
   modern game engine as a platform for knowledge representation in urban
   planning and how it can be used to model ambiguity. We also investigate
   how urban planners can benefit from immersion when it comes to data
   exploration and knowledge discovery. We apply the concept of using
   primitives to publicly available transportation datasets and social
   feeds of New York city, we discuss a gesture-based VR extension of our
   framework and lastly, we conclude the paper with feedback from expert
   users in urban planning and with an outlook of future challenges.

AB Accurate identification and classification of agricultural fields is
   essential for analyzing crop growth, agricultural resource management,
   and supporting decision-making in precision farming. The current study
   uses the remote sensing images to classify the agricultural lands using
   the You Only Look Once (YOLO) V8 approach. The dataset consists of
   multiple classes such as forests, river, sealake, highway, pasture,
   residential, industrial, and permanent crop. Various versions of YOLO
   V8, namely the nano, small, and medium versions of the deep learning
   model are used in the classification of the sensor images. The impact of
   the hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, optimizers, learning
   rate, momentum, and weight decay are analyzed across all the versions of
   YOLO V8. The experimental outcome demonstrates the performance of each
   model concerning the accuracy, precision, and recall. Based on the
   experimental performance, the YOLO V8 model is efficient in precisely
   recognizing various land cover, which result in offering a scalable and
   efficient approach for real-time agricultural field identification. From
   the experimental results, it can be stated that the medium variant has
   achieved the highest top_1 accuracy value of 99% at 50 epochs while nano

AB Many real-time applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) need to deal
   with correlated information generated by multiple sensors. The design of
   efficient status update strategies that minimize the Age of Correlated
   Information (AoCI) is a key factor. In this paper, we consider an IoT
   network consisting of sensors equipped with the energy harvesting (EH)
   capability. We optimize the average AoCI at the data fusion center (DFC)
   by appropriately managing the energy harvested by sensors, whose true
   battery states are unobservable during the decision-making process.
   Particularly, we first formulate the dynamic status update procedure as
   a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where the
   environmental dynamics are unknown to the DFC. In order to address the
   challenges arising from the causality of energy usage, unknown
   environmental dynamics, unobservability of sensors' true battery states,
   and large-scale discrete action space, we devise a deep reinforcement
   learning (DRL)-based dynamic status update algorithm. The algorithm
   leverages the advantages of the soft actor-critic and long short-term
   memory techniques. Meanwhile, it incorporates our proposed action
   decomposition and mapping mechanism. Extensive simulations are conducted
   to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm by comparing it
   with available DRL algorithms for POMDPs.

AB Forest fires have become a major problem that every year has devastating
   consequences at the environmental level, negatively impacting the social
   and economic spheres of the affected regions. Aiming to mitigate these
   terrible effects, intelligent prediction models focused on early fire
   detection are becoming common practice. Considering mainly a preventive
   approach, these models often use tools that indifferently apply
   statistical or symbolic inference techniques. However, exploring the
   potential for the hybrid use of both, as is already being done in other
   research areas, is a significant novelty with direct application to
   early fire detection. In this line, this work proposes the design,
   development, and proof of concept of a new intelligent hybrid system
   that aims to provide support to the decisions of the teams responsible
   for defining strategies for the prevention, detection, and extinction of
   forest fires. The system determines three risk levels: a general one
   called Objective Technical Fire Risk, based on machine learning
   algorithms, which determines the global danger of a fire in some area of
   the region under study, and two more specific others which indicate the
   risk over a limited area of the region. These last two risk levels,
   expressed in matrix form and called Technical Risk Matrix and Expert
   Risk Matrix, are calculated through a convolutional neural network and
   an expert system, respectively. After that, they are combined by means
   of another expert system to determine the Global Risk Matrix that
   quantifies the risk of fire in each of the study regions and generates a
   visual representation of these results through a color map of the region
   itself. The proof of concept of the system has been carried out on a set
   of historical data from fires that occurred in the Montesinho Natural
   Park (Portugal), demonstrating its potential utility as a tool for the
   prevention and early detection of forest fires. The intelligent hybrid
   system designed has demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities in
   such a complex environment as forest fires, which are conditioned by
   multiple factors. Future improvements associated with data integration
   and the formalization of knowledge bases will make it possible to obtain
   a standard tool that could be used and validated in real time in
   different forest areas.

AB When an aircraft experiences an unexpected issue during flight
   operations, a technician determines whether the aircraft can safely
   perform the next flight. This operational decision process - known as
   dispatch assessment - has to happen within limited available time
   between aircraft arrival and departure. Currently, technicians face two
   main problems during the assessment: lack of access to decision support
   information and a time-consuming process for finding relevant
   information in extensive maintenance manuals. These issues often lead to
   delays and additional costs and are indicative of three larger
   challenges in the decision support domain: 1) a paucity of decision
   support models and applications for operational processes in
   maintenance; 2) relatively few efforts in applying and evaluating
   artifacts in experimental and real-life operational settings; and 3) a
   lack of systematic development, application and evaluation of
   digitization and automation efforts of complex decision processes in
   maintenance. This paper applies a design science research approach to
   address these challenges and introduces two novel artifacts: a decision
   support framework for real-time decision making in aircraft dispatch,
   and a web-based prototype tool accessible through mobile solutions. The
   practical relevance of the framework and prototype is validated through
   two representative application and evaluation studies, one in an
   experimental setting and one in an operational environment. Results show
   significant time savings and strong qualitative indications towards a
   higher incentive to use documentation and reducing human risk factors
   that lead to maintenance error.

AB During emergencies, the efficiency of first response deployment is
   critical. Once the assignments are decided for the distribution of first
   responders, the deployment efficiency for the teams to arrive at the
   affected zone is determined by the response time. Knowing the condition
   on the road network could substantially reduce the response time, in
   other words, increasing the transport efficiency for the deployment. On
   the other hand, real-time traffic data acquisition has been the core and
   basis of all development of advanced traffic-management systems. For the
   goal of measuring reliable traffic speed, the traffic data sources
   should generally include spot speed data received from vehicle
   detectors, space speed data collected by probe vehicles, and historical
   data to generate traffic information for main arterials within urban
   areas. This paper describes the fusion technique to integrate active and
   passive data from spot and space data for the estimation of traffic
   speed in emergency scenarios based on entropy and optimal weight. This
   provides road-network information to decision makers in emergency
   response. Through the proposed fusion process, the collection, fusion,
   and analysis of traffic speed data are performed. The process is
   composed of three consecutive computational steps. The first step is
   data screening to reduce inaccuracy of outliers in the system. The
   second step is to transform data into the same basis of space mean
   speed, and to classify and individualize the data. Data can then be
   converted into probabilities for the production of entropy. The third
   step is to apply the optimal weight rule to generate weight allocation
   for different data sources. The encouraging results from the data
   processing and sensitivity analysis revealed the potential to apply the
   proposed data fusion process to decision making for emergency response.

AB Background: Chronic conditions require robust healthcare data
   integration to support personalized care, real-time decision-making, and
   secure information exchange. However, fragmented data ecosystems disrupt
   interoperability, complicate patient-centered care (PCC), and present
   challenges for incorporating genomic data into clinical workflows.
   Objective: This systematic review with thematic synthesis aims to
   identify key challenges and synthesize existing strategies from the
   literature to inform the development of a foundational digital health
   data integration ecosystem. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we
   systematically screened literature across multiple databases. A thematic
   synthesis approach was used to categorize findings into three primary
   themes: interoperability, PCC, and genomic data integration. Results: A
   total of 161 studies were included. Key challenges identified include
   semantic misalignment across commonly used healthcare standards such as
   HL7 FHIR and SNOMED CT, limited cross-system data exchange, inadequate
   patient engagement features in EHRs, and concerns regarding the security
   and clinical utility of genomic data. Strategies described across the
   literature include ontology-based interoperability models, AI-supported
   PCC frameworks, and blockchain-enabled genomic data governance.
   Conclusion: By analyzing current methodologies, research gaps, and
   implementation challenges, this review offers an evidence-based
   foundation to guide future advancements in healthcare data integration.
   It supports the development of scalable, privacy-preserving, and
   ethically governed data-sharing infrastructures that enable personalized
   medicine and real-time clinical interventions.

AB Amidst the ongoing digital transformation, enterprises face the
   challenge of managing ever-expanding volumes of data from multiple
   sources and diverse structures. Semantic data fabric emerges as a
   promising solution, offering an innovative approach to integrate data
   resources from various channels and produce meaningful insights. The
   selection of an appropriate data fabric solution has become a focal
   point amidst burgeoning data lakes and silos, garnering international
   attention. This research aims to precisely evaluate potential data
   fabric solutions using an innovative synergetic intuitionistic fuzzy
   evaluation model. We propose a hybrid approach, IF-AHP-Entropy-ELECTRE,
   which integrates the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), entropy, and
   elimination et choix traduisant la r & eacute;alit & eacute; (ELECTRE)
   techniques within the framework of intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets. This
   model is utilized to a data fabric solution selection (DFSS) issue for
   an appliance company, identifying the optimal solution based on its
   superior performance in foundational technology, real-time analytics,
   and customizable features. The effectiveness and adaptability of this
   approach stem from a novel hierarchical evaluative criteria system
   encompassing technology, capability, cost, and security. The criteria
   weights, derived from IF-AHP-Entropy, reflect both subjective and
   objective judgments of decision-makers, while the ranking generated by
   IF-ELECTRE employs a piecewise scoring function and a unique distance
   measure, factoring in optimistic perspectives and cross-information.
   Through sensitivity and comparative analyses, our approach demonstrates
   enhanced robustness, precision, and adaptability in dynamic DFSS
   contexts when compared to traditional multicriteria decision-making
   methods, such as IF-WSM, IF-TOPSIS, and IF-ELECTRE. Specifically, our
   model provides a decision support system that combines extensive
   functionality with a user-friendly design, making it highly effective
   for DFSS challenges. This approach not only establishes a solid
   foundation for data integration in data management but also enhances
   business competitiveness and supports sustained growth in the digital
   economy.

AB Vehicular networks are experiencing a significant transformation driven
   by integrating connected vehicles and Intelligent Transportation Systems
   (ITS). The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a rapidly evolving domain
   within ITS that connects vehicles, infrastructure, and smart devices to
   facilitate seamless data exchange. This data encompasses vital
   information, and by leveraging it, vehicles can make informed decisions
   and adapt to real-time situations. For instance, traditional vehicle
   maintenance practices often rely on reactive approaches, addressing
   issues after failures occur, which can lead to safety risks, costly
   repairs, and disruptions. Thus, there is a pressing need for proactive
   solutions to identify vehicle failures before they escalate.
   Accordingly, we propose the IoV-TwinChain framework integrating Digital
   Twin (DT), Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain for performing
   predictive maintenance of vehicles in the IoV by monitoring vehicle
   operating conditions to prevent road breakdowns and failures. DT
   provides real-time monitoring of vehicle operating conditions, while ML
   facilitates data-driven predictions for the predictive maintenance of
   vehicles. The IoV-TwinChain framework utilizes blockchain for data
   integrity and traceability within physical and twin environments. We
   implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) of the IoV-TwinChain framework using
   Microsoft Azure DT, ML models such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and
   Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, we formally verify the IoV-TwinChain
   framework correctness using High-Level Petri Nets and Bounded Model-
   Checking methods. With our PoC implementation and formal verification,
   we demonstrate that the IoV-TwinChain framework effectively enhances the
   predictive maintenance capabilities of vehicles in the IoV and ensures
   the reliability and accuracy of the system.

AB In-flight icing remains a significant challenge for the aviation
   industry. While mature solutions for conventional aircraft exist, the
   options for small fixed-wing uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are
   limited, with the current solution being to postpone the flight until
   icing conditions have passed. Consequently, the challenges related to
   aircraft icing continue to be highly relevant, but now with a stronger
   emphasis on size, cost, and efficiency to better fit the smaller UAV
   platforms, which are currently experiencing high commercial interest. A
   crucial prerequisite for efficient ice protection solutions is the
   availability of real-time ice detection systems. This survey aims to
   provide an overview of recent developments in research on in-flight
   icing detection solutions suitable for UAVs. The survey covers
   atmospheric icing detection, direct ice detection, and indirect ice
   detection methods. Among these, the indirect methods, which are based on
   monitoring the aircraft performance degradation due to in-flight icing,
   are emphasized. The performance-based methods rely on flight data
   analysis, estimation, and detection algorithms, making them ideal for
   UAVs as they require only minimal aircraft modification and can be
   implemented retrospectively.

AB Industry 5.0 refers to the fifth industrial revolution that leverages
   advanced technologies such as Internet of things (IoT) and artificial
   intelligence (AI) to increase efficiency, productivity, and flexibility
   in manufacturing and other industries. Wireless IoT devices help collect
   and transmit real-time data to support intelligent decision-making,
   while AI algorithms process and analyze the data to optimize production
   processes, predict equipment failure, and enhance supply chain
   management. To achieve efficient integration for the data fused by
   various sensors, the data should be perfectly synchronized and
   out-of-errors. In cellular-based sensors, this requires the base station
   (BS) to know the state of the channel at each node. In this work, we
   propose a novel method for CSI compression by learning an approximation
   for a sufficient statistics function. Our method establishes a new
   category of compression techniques based on the theory of sufficient
   statistics. Moreover, we present a detailed analysis of the upper bound
   of the prediction error in our specific scenario. We develop a Bayesian
   optimization framework to optimally select the adopted neural network
   architecture. The experimental results confirm that our solution
   outperforms both conventional and learning-based solutions in terms of
   reconstruction error, model size, and scalability.

AB Internet of things provides ways to obtain information about farm
   production; however, the more data there is, the harder it is to
   determine the correct way to process these data. The solutions on the
   market are aimed specifically at gathering data, rather than processing
   and analyzing them. Poultry farming is one of the fields, where the
   application of Industry 4.0 principles is becoming a necessity,
   especially in the case of greenhouse gas control Minimum standards and
   rules in the poultry management are regulated by EU Directives and
   required parameters must be ensured at all times, therefore, real-time
   environmental monitoring must be performed. The only practically viable
   approach is to automate data gathering using appropriate sensors, which
   is only possible if a standardized data structure model is defined.
   In this research the Cyber-Physical Model is the proposed as a basis to
   development of smart poultry farm management system that is adjustable
   to particular production needs. Three main data groups are defined -
   necessary data to ensure requirements of EU Directives, farm monitoring
   data for business analysis and optimization, and additional data that
   can influence overall poultry farm management. The proposed data set was
   implemented into the existing infrastructure of a Baltic poultry farm.
   Multiple CO2 (carbon dioxide) and NH3 (ammonia) sensors were installed
   in order to gather data, measurements of which previously were taken
   manually by the farm's staff The solution was developed on centralized
   cloud-based data processing system, where MQTT Broker was used for
   security measures. The processed data is used by the decision support
   system with the aim to define optimal feeding and housing. (C) 2022 The

AB Information technologies are rapidly advancing the way in which animal
   health data and information are collected, analysed and shared in order
   to support animal health management, disease surveillance and response,
   and decision-making. However, the full potential of these technologies
   for early detection and response to natural or intentional disease
   events has not been fully realised in animal health at the global level.
   This paper discusses advances made in these technologies and examples of
   how they have been applied in animal health for near real-time data
   collection and analysis. The technologies reviewed include: i) mobile
   health (mHealth) technologies, wireless sensors and biosensors for
   remote data collection; crowdsourced and Internet-based data collection;
   and iii) electronic health (eHealth) technologies for data integration
   and analysis.
   Experiences of implementing these technologies, and challenges with
   their use, are also discussed so as to provide recommendations on their
   future application in animal health. The world is ripe with
   opportunities to develop and enhance mHealth and eHealth technologies
   that are cost effective and capable of near real-time data collection
   and analysis. Such technologies have been shown to be valuable and
   capable of being implemented in both developing and developed countries,
   and ultimately will strengthen disease surveillance and reporting across
   the globe. International mechanisms and data standards are needed to
   facilitate the sharing and analysis of animal and human health data
   between countries. Identifying ways in which animal and human health
   data collection and analysis can be better integrated within a 'One
   Health' approach will enhance the coordination and capability of disease
   detection and response at the human animal interface.

AB Digital Twin provides high-precision data fusion, real-time state
   prediction and optimized decision support in the machining process. A
   reliable tool wear monitoring (TWM) model is essential to ensure data
   accuracy within the digital twin system and to enhance the reliability
   of wear state assessments. However, existing monitoring models primarily
   consider the wear process constraints in the average sense and do not
   strictly ensure compliance with the underlying physical mechanism. To
   address this issue, a TWM model integrating the knowledge-data-driven
   physicalinformed neural network (PINN) is proposed in the digital twin
   intelligent monitoring for the milling process. On the basis of
   considering the monotonicity of the wear evolution process, the
   potential mechanism of wear rate change is employed as a hard physical
   constraint to construct the physical information loss. A physically
   significant knowledge deviation is introduced to guide the learning
   process of the neural network, ensuring that the model output is mapped
   to a value domain strictly adhering to the physical mechanism, thus
   improving the physical consistency. The results of milling experiments
   under three different machining conditions demonstrate that compared to
   the traditional neural network, the proposed PINN model exhibits higher
   precision and generalization, reducing the average RMSE by 11.87 %,
   10.35 % and 15.04 %, respectively. In addition, after the optimal model
   is trained offline, the response time from online data processing to
   obtaining the wear output is within 2 s, while the PINN model's
   computation time is on the order of milliseconds. The PINN model
   provides real-time tool wear data for the digital twin intelligent
   monitoring system with a low-latency response and integrates with the
   decision support system to facilitate iterative optimization of the
   digital twin system, enabling intelligent prediction and maintenance.

AB The stochastic nature of the multi-sensor monitored aero-engine
   degradation process limits the accuracy of its remaining useful life
   (RUL) prediction. To address this problem, a hybrid prognosis method for
   multi-sensor monitored aero-engine based on health indicators and the
   Wiener process is proposed. The method constructs composite health
   indicators (CHI) for aero-engine. The one-dimensional sensor-monitored
   signals are converted to two-dimensional features through the Gramian
   Angle Field (GAF), thereby preserving potential feature relationships in
   the time series data. A hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and
   Transformer are constructed, and the feature maps obtained from the GAF
   are used as inputs to fuse multi-sensor data to obtain the CHI. The
   Wiener process is used to model the CHI degradation. The initial
   parameters for the degradation model are obtained using the maximum
   likelihood estimation. The Bayesian and expectation maximization methods
   adaptively update the parameters online based on real-time data. On this
   basis, the probability density function of the RUL under the
   first-hitting-time is derived. To enhance adaptability, CHI is combined
   with the Wiener process for joint training. The effectiveness of the
   hybrid model is experimentally verified on the Commercial Modular
   Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset, and the
   generalization ability is further verified on the New Commercial Modular
   Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (N-CMAPSS) dataset. The results show
   that the proposed method improves the root mean square error by 2.07 and
   the prediction accuracy by 18% on average, which can meet the real-time
   and storage requirements in engineering applications and provide
   technical support for actual maintenance decision-making.

AB Multimodal deep learning has emerged as a key paradigm in contemporary
   medical diagnostics, advancing precision medicine by enabling
   integration and learning from diverse data sources. The exponential
   growth of high-dimensional healthcare data, encompassing genomic,
   transcriptomic, and other omics profiles, as well as radiological
   imaging and histopathological slides, makes this approach increasingly
   important because, when examined separately, these data sources only
   offer a fragmented picture of intricate disease processes. Multimodal
   deep learning leverages the complementary properties of multiple data
   modalities to enable more accurate prognostic modeling, more robust
   disease characterization, and improved treatment decision-making. This
   review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of
   multimodal deep learning approaches in medical diagnosis. We classify
   and examine important application domains, such as (1) radiology, where
   automated report generation and lesion detection are facilitated by
   image-text integration; (2) histopathology, where fusion models improve
   tumor classification and grading; and (3) multi-omics, where molecular
   subtypes and latent biomarkers are revealed through cross-modal
   learning. We provide an overview of representative research,
   methodological advancements, and clinical consequences for each domain.
   Additionally, we critically analyzed the fundamental issues preventing
   wider adoption, including computational complexity (particularly in
   training scalable, multi-branch networks), data heterogeneity (resulting
   from modality-specific noise, resolution variations, and inconsistent
   annotations), and the challenge of maintaining significant cross-modal
   correlations during fusion. These problems impede interpretability,
   which is crucial for clinical trust and use, in addition to performance
   and generalizability. Lastly, we outline important areas for future
   research, including the development of standardized protocols for
   harmonizing data, the creation of lightweight and interpretable fusion
   architectures, the integration of real-time clinical decision support
   systems, and the promotion of cooperation for federated multimodal
   learning. Our goal is to provide researchers and clinicians with a
   concise overview of the field's present state, enduring constraints, and
   exciting directions for further research through this review.

AB In the context of the booming construction of smart cities, multi-source
   data fusion and analysis algorithms play a key role in optimizing real
   estate management and improving urban efficiency. In this review, we
   comprehensively and systematically review the relevant algorithms,
   covering the types, characteristics, fusion techniques, analysis
   algorithms, and their synergies of multi-source data. We found that
   multi-source data, including sensors, social media, citizen feedback,
   and GIS data, face challenges such as data quality and privacy security
   when being fused. Data fusion algorithms are diverse and have their own
   advantages and disadvantages. Data analysis algorithms help urban
   management in areas such as spatial analysis and deep learning.
   Algorithm collaboration can improve decision-making accuracy and
   efficiency and promote the rational allocation of urban resources. In
   the future, algorithm development will focus on data quality, real-time,
   deep mining, interdisciplinary research, privacy protection, and
   collaborative application expansion, providing strong support for the
   sustainable development of smart cities.

AB This study proposes a data-driven statistical model using multi sensor
   fusion and Kalman filtering for real-time water quality assessment in
   lakes. A recursive estimation technique, the Kalman Filter, is employed
   to handle uncertainties and enhance computational efficiency. The fusion
   process integrates data from sensors monitoring parameters like
   chlorophyll concentration, surface water elevation, temperature, and
   precipitation, producing Markov features to capture temporal transitions
   and environmental dynamics. Data synchronization and fusion are achieved
   through recursive KF methods, enabling real-time adaptive management in
   response to environmental fluctuations such as seasonal changes,
   precipitation (6-18%), and evaporation rates (1.2-11.9 mm/day). Over a
   30-day evaluation period, the model accurately predicted chlorophyll

   enhanced prediction stability and sensitivity, with the KF maintaining

AB Real-time monitoring of leaf area index (LAI) in cotton (Gossypium
   hirsutum L.) plays a vital role in guiding field fertilization, water
   management, growth observation and yield prediction. The use of unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with diverse sensors enables flexible
   and rapid LAI measurement across extensive areas. This study evaluates
   the efficacy of UAV-mounted LiDAR and high-resolution camera-derived
   point cloud data in LAI prediction. We assessed the integration of
   canopy spectral-textural characteristics from multispectral data with
   structural features from point cloud data for LAI forecasting.
   Furthermore, we compared various machine learning and deep learning
   models, selected the optimal one, and applied the SHAP (Shapley Additive
   Explanations) method to identify key features and their influence
   patterns in this model. The findings are distilled into four key points:
   (1) The performance of canopy structure metrics based on the two sensors
   varied across fertility periods due to differences in canopy closure;
   (2) The DNN-based (Deep Neural Network) LAI prediction model excelled
   with a single-period dataset, achieving an R2 of 0.81 and an RMSE% of
   11.36 %. Similarly, in full-period multimodal data fusion, it
   demonstrated superior performance, evidenced by an R2 of 0.84 and an
   RMSE% of 9.94 %. (3) Compared to the unimodal data model, the multimodal
   data model yielded superior results and exhibited greater robustness.
   (4) In the DNN-based LAI prediction model utilizing multimodal data,
   texture features contributed most significantly. The results suggest
   that the DNN model, when employing multimodal data fusion, offers not
   only relatively precise and robust estimates of crop LAI but also
   contributes valuable insights for crop phenotyping and enhanced field
   management. This approach subsequently improves spatial prediction
   accuracy and the quality of decision-making in crop production.

AB The lean manufacturing benefits are well documented in literature for
   different types of industries. However, data acquisition and computation
   are the basic difficulties or pain points in developing value stream
   maps to find different types of waste. Industrial internet of things
   (IIoT) and digital twin enable fast, and dynamic data acquisition and
   computation with ease. This paper presents digitalization as a tool for
   the successful adoption of lean manufacturing through real-time data
   acquisition and computation. The proposed solution incorporates smart
   low-cost sensor-based data acquisition with a unified dashboard for
   operational and strategic decision making. The implementation of the
   proposed unified system is demonstrated through the development of a
   digital twin and a dynamic dashboard for a modular production system
   (MPS) assembly line. The dynamic data integration through the deployment
   of IIoT synchronizes the physical system to dashboard and digital
   system. The unified dashboard supports effective and timely decision
   making, especially for shop floors with alternate process plan
   configurations. The adoption of the proposed solution in an MPS assembly
   line demonstrates the capability of the architecture as a robust
   decision support system. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   database includes variety of multi-scale information covering core,
   disaster specific and non-spatial information for effective decision
   making. Every disaster is unique and requires specific information for
   effective handling of the situation in all the phases of emergency
   management. Spatial technologies enable effective disaster risk
   management to assess and map extent of natural events such as floods,
   cyclones, tsunami, landslide, earthquake, forest fire etc. These
   disaster products derived from space based inputs generated in near/real
   time are extremely useful for planning and decision making. However,
   building spatial database system is a complex task because of key
   challenges. In this article the concept of spatial data integration is
   defined for effective integration procedures, storage methods, analysis,
   and dissemination of these inputs as web services for decision support

AB Assimilation of data from heterogeneous sensors and sensor networks is
   critical for achieving accurate measurements of environmental processes
   at the time and space scales necessary to improve forecasting and
   decision-making. Owing to different measurement accuracies and types of
   spatial and/or temporal measurement support of the component sensors, it
   is often unclear how best to combine these data. This study explores the
   utility of ubiquitous sensors producing categorical wet/dry rainfall
   measurements for improving the resolution of areal quantitative
   precipitation estimates through fusion with weather radar observations.
   The model developed in this study employs a Markov random field model to
   compute the probability of rainfall at sub-grid pixels. These
   likelihoods are used to 'unmix' the cell-averaged rainfall rate measured
   by the radar. Simulation studies using synthetic and known rainfall
   fields reveal that the model can improve remotely sensed quantitative
   rainfall intensity measurements by 40% using networks of ubiquitous
   sensors with a density of 56 sensors per square kilometer, and for
   denser networks, the accuracy can increase by as much as 50%.

AB The agricultural sector is evolving with the adoption of smart farming
   technologies, where Digital Twins (DTs) offer new possibilities for
   real-time monitoring, simulation, and decision-making. While previous
   research has explored the Internet of Things (IoT), UAVs, machine
   learning (ML), and remote sensing (RS) in enhancing agricultural
   efficiency, a systematic approach to integrating these technologies
   within a DTs ecosystem remains underdeveloped. This paper presents a
   systematic review of 167 studies published between 2018 and 2025. The
   objective of this study is to examine recent advancements in DTs-enabled
   precision agriculture and propose a comprehensive framework for
   designing, integrating, and optimizing DTs in smart farming. The study
   systematically examines the current state of DT adoption, identifies key
   barriers, and computational efficiency challenges, and provides a
   step-by-step methodology for DT implementation. The review sheds light
   on potential future research direction and implications for policy, with
   the aim to speed up the adoption of DTs-based farm management systems in
   their operational success and commercial viability through analysis of
   practical applications and future perspectives. This study presents an
   innovative strategy for integrating digital and physical systems into
   agriculture and is an important contribution to existing literature.

   integration framework to continuously collect and update multimodal
   datasets comprising over 800 features per case. Quality control
   measures, using 143 logical comparisons, addressed missing data and
   outliers, achieving median accuracies of 92.6% for surgical and 98.7%
   for molecular pathology. An Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process with
   natural language processing transformed unstructured data, enabling
   survival analyses stratified by tumor stage, which revealed significant
   stage-dependent differences. The CDSS dashboard visualizes patient
   trajectories and key milestones. User feedback from oncology

AB Effective wildland fire management requires real-time access to
   comprehensive and distilled information from different data sources. The
   Digital Twin technology becomes a promising tool in optimizing the
   processes of wildfire prevention, monitoring, disaster response, and
   post-fire recovery. This review examines the potential utility of
   Digital Twin in wildfire management and aims to inspire further
   exploration and experimentation by researchers and practitioners in the
   fields of environment, forestry, fire ecology, and firefighting
   services. By creating virtual replicas of wildfire in the physical
   world, a Digital Twin platform facilitates data integration from
   multiple sources, such as remote sensing, weather forecasting, and
   ground-based sensors, providing a holistic view of emergency response
   and decision-making. Furthermore, Digital Twin can support
   simulation-based training and scenario testing for prescribed fire
   planning and firefighting to improve preparedness and response to
   evacuation and rescue. Successful applications of Digital Twin in
   wildfire management require horizontal collaboration among researchers,
   practitioners, and stakeholders, as well as enhanced resource sharing
   and data exchange. This review seeks a deeper understanding of future
   wildland fire management from a technological perspective and
   inspiration of future research and implementation. Further research
   should focus on refining and validating Digital Twin models and the
   integration into existing fire management operations, and then
   demonstrating them in real wildland fires.

AB An exploration information system (EIS) is a way of creating, and
   managing exploration targets and should include the entire process from
   conceptual mineral system models to, modelling the mineral system using
   available data, to generation of targets or prospect areas. The main
   goal for any EIS is to help find new mineral deposits that are economic
   to mine and process at the financial conditions of the time.
   Prioritisation and management of exploration targets is a key to success
   in mineral exploration, particularly with the increasing use of mineral
   potential modelling techniques, including AI, which can generate a large
   number of targets in a study area for testing. In this paper, we present
   ideas for the components for an EIS designed to optimise the mineral
   exploration process and provide critical decision-making support. The
   Macquarie Arc porphyry copper-gold mineral system in New South Wales is
   used as an example to illustrate how such a system can be developed and
   implemented. Accepted mineral potential mapping workflows are used
   coupled with a targeting process that generates, attributes, and ranks
   prospect areas to produce exploration targets. The proposed front-end of
   the EIS is an Exploration Management Dashboard, which can be used by
   executives and managers to facilitate informed decision-making and
   optimal allocation of capital. We advocate for a standardised system
   capable of accommodating various commodities, input datasets, and
   diverse analytical techniques, including AI-driven methods and
   validation tools. Flexibility for user customisation, especially for
   non-technical users, and real-time data integration are seen as an
   essential part of any EIS. Furthermore, the system is designed to be
   dynamic, with continuous updates and improvements as new data are
   collected, ensuring that exploration is always focussed on the areas
   with the greatest potential prospectivity.

   platforms tailored explicitly to transport enterprises.
   Methodologically, a thorough analysis of critical infrastructure-related
   challenges was conducted, emphasizing the integration of a
   service-oriented approach to enhance overall functionality. Central to
   the paper's approach is the careful navigation of conflicting user
   requirements, resource constraints, and the imperative of maintaining
   adaptability in service implementation. Additionally, a robust data flow
   analysis framework is presented, encompassing data collection, model
   building, and model extrapolation, which enables the generation of
   reliable outputs essential for informed decision-making. Notably, the
   study underscores the pivotal role played by the EN.I.R.I.S.S.T.
   research infrastructure in delivering essential services to the
   transportation domain, offering accessible data, user-friendly
   interfaces, and data analysis tools. The findings highlight the
   enthusiastic reception of the diverse services among potential users,
   indicating a strong willingness to engage and benefit from the proposed
   solutions. By emphasizing the integration of intelligent services, the
   paper seeks to present a systematic approach aimed at enhancing the

   Nowadays, thanks to the technology available, there is the opportunity
   to move to a data-driven decision process. To meet the increasingly

   to integrate and organize operational and business-related data into a
   common data lake and use these data as a source for a business analytics
   software able to assist and support daily operations and future
   investment programs. This paper describes the activities and results of
   a digitalization case study carried out in Italy where a leading water
   utility serving over 2 million residents implemented an integrated water
   management system to enhance the business performance by leveraging a
   data-driven approach. The project resulted in the establishment of an
   advanced control room at the company's headquarters, featuring real-time
   dashboards that are fully integrated with the utility's operational

AB The large amount of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) is
   exploited by the data fusion process to improve the quality of services
   (QoS) requested by the user. Data fusion systems typically collect and
   fuse data from various sensor nodes to achieve better data quality (more
   precision, accuracy, or global view) on the field of interest. For the
   specific case of the wireless sensor network (WSN) based on cluster-tree
   topology, the data transmission between nodes and the intermediate data
   fusion node (DFN) depends primarily on the channel access often managed
   by the Carrier-Sens Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
   protocol. In this article, a modified CSMA/CA is proposed to meet the
   requirements of the WSN real-time data fusion applications and, in
   particular, to ensure better management of the transmission channel. It
   takes into account a transmission time-delay, schedules the
   retransmission dynamically, and eliminates data packets scheduled beyond
   the predefined time-delay, thereby releasing the channel to the benefit
   of other nodes. Moreover, before proceeding with the fusion at the DFN
   level, it optimizes the probability of receiving data from each node in
   the specified time-delay. The proposed solution is implemented under the
   Contiki operating system; it aims to collect data from all nodes within
   a given time-delay. The results of simulations and experiments show
   increasing in the data received within time-delay, collisions reduction,
   and saving energy in the WSN. Moreover, two real-time data fusion
   applications, namely mobile localization and majority decision-making,
   are also simulated to support the found results. Compared to the use of
   CSMA/CA as implemented in Contiki, using the proposed modified CSMA/CA
   in both data fusion applications improves QoS.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be used to extract deep features
   that can be incorporated into reinforcement learning systems to enable
   improved decision-making; DRL can therefore also be used for managing
   stock portfolios. Traditional methods cannot fully exploit the
   advantages of DRL because they are generally based on real-time stock
   quotes, which do not have sufficient features for making comprehensive
   decisions. In this study, in addition to stock quotes, we introduced
   stock financial indices as additional stock features. Moreover, we used
   Markowitz mean-variance theory for determining stock correlation. A
   three-agent deep reinforcement learning model called Collaborative
   Multi-agent reinforcement learning-based stock Portfolio management
   System (CMPS) was designed and trained based on fused data. In CMPS,
   each agent was implemented with a deep Q-network to obtain the features
   of time-series stock data, and a self-attention network was used to
   combine the output of each agent. We added a risk-free asset strategy to
   CMPS to prevent risks and referred to this model as CMPS-Risk Free
   (CMPS-RF). We conducted experiments under different market conditions
   using the stock data of China Shanghai Stock Exchange 50 and compared
   our model with the state-of-the-art models. The results showed that CMPS
   could obtain better profits than the compared benchmark models, and
   CMPS-RF was able to accurately recognize the market risk and achieved
   the best Sharpe and Calmar ratios. The study findings are expected to
   aid in the development of an efficient investment-trading strategy.

AB As facility owners and operators, public sector organizations (such as
   government agencies) that provide public facilities and services not
   only maintain the existing capital assets but also plan for future
   developments on an ongoing basis through a capital improvement program
   (CIP). The CIP identifies capital projects and is typically funded
   through several distinct funding sources with specific usage, timing,
   and reporting restrictions. The continuous nature of capital improvement
   planning compounded by the potential for scope or funding availability
   changes further makes it a challenge to retain the flexibility to add
   new and different funding sources to an existing funding allocation
   plan. Existing literature about this problem is sparse, and a systemic
   solution is yet to be proposed that enables an owner organization to
   meet its goals while maintaining fiscal responsibility toward its
   funding agencies. The financial digital twin (FinDT) framework developed
   in this study integrates fund allocation and accounting with project
   acquisition in real time and enables the owner to automate funding
   allocation tasks and to synchronize change management while ensuring
   compliance with funding restrictions. The goal of this framework is to
   leverage rule-based knowledge management to consolidate and continually
   optimize the efficient use of accurate financial information at all
   stages of the capital asset lifecycle. This is accomplished through
   automation and digital twin (DT) integration. A use case was developed
   to demonstrate and evaluate the FinDT, which was found to hold potential
   for more efficient information management and support for decision
   making through enterprise-level data integration. The framework
   developed in this study can be used to display other nongeometric
   attribute information in a building information model for the purposes
   of visualization and interactive, efficient decision making.

   information on the wildfire perimeter and improve fire prediction.
   Firstly, a data fusion scheme is devised to employ available historical
   data in combination with real-time measurements to provide updated
   inputs to the fire propagation model. Then the model is used to predict
   the future fire perimeter and uses these predictions to guide the UAV to
   track the fire perimeter better. The proposed system is evaluated in
   extensive simulation experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness for
   real-time wildfire perimeter propagation tracking.

AB In the current business scenario, real-time analysis of enterprise data
   through Business Intelligence (BI) is crucial for supporting operational
   activities and taking any strategic decision. The automated ETL
   (extraction, transformation, and load) process ensures data ingestion
   into the data warehouse in near real-time, and insights are generated
   through the BI process based on real-time data. In this paper, we have
   concentrated on automated credit risk assessment in the financial domain
   based on the machine learning approach. The machine learning-based
   classification techniques can furnish a self-regulating process to
   categorize data. Establishing an automated credit decision-making system
   helps the lending institution to manage the risks, increase operational
   efficiency and comply with regulators. In this paper, an empirical
   approach is taken for credit risk assessment using logistic regression
   and neural network classification method in compliance with Basel II
   standards. Here, Basel II standards are adopted to calculate the
   expected loss. The required data integration for building machine
   learning models is done through an automated ETL process. We have
   concluded this research work by evaluating this new methodology for

AB Despite the advancements to improve patient safety, a significant number
   of errors still occur in Operating Suites (OS). To improve medical
   decision-making and the resulting quality of care, it is essential to
   monitor and understand medical activities' workflow and interactions.
   Although some strategies employ different sensor devices, their focus is
   not on generating complete workflow information. They only combine
   different data sources to generate their final output, lacking at least
   one piece of information from a workflow. To tackle this challenge, this
   paper presents BEHOLDER, a distributed architecture model for sensor
   data acquisition and processing. BEHOLDER's main contribution lies in
   its multi-sensor data fusion algorithms to extract a computational
   representation of activities in surgical procedures. In addition,
   BEHOLDER is flexible to accommodate different deployment
   configurations,combining depth cameras, Ultra-Wideband positioning
   systems,and deep learning-based human pose estimation (HPE) mechanisms.
   The workflow monitoring mechanism was deployed in an actual hybrid OS
   for an extensive evaluation of the proposal. Our experiments demonstrate
   that the architecture can capture the information required to monitor
   the surgical workflow. In particular, the proposed HPE methodology
   accurately detects the poses of medical staff members, with a maximum
   error of 5 cm. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB "Pipeline integrity" implies the concepts of failure prevention,
   inspection and repair that help inspection engineer to maximize their
   safety. With the entire circumstance built on the reliable pipeline, its
   integrity is receiving more attention than ever of its high-tech tubular
   structure with modeling and monitoring. In the modern pipeline
   infrastructure, regulating the pressure and flow rate throughout
   transportation plays a crucial role with tedious data frameworks. To
   afford a suitable data fusion platform for IoT-based monitoring and
   control, Model Predictive Control is formulated. Since the different
   models can extract a variety of field sensors data may result in
   inconsistent results in the decision process. In the proposed work, data
   fusion is integrated with model predictive control to improve the
   robustness by tackling different scenario risk rates to formulate the
   final model for realtime implementation. The accurate models are
   selected based on the scheduled task identification and risk probability
   characteristics in the oil pipelines. The final control signal will be
   actuated based on the multi-criteria decision-making method using cloud
   server data with field PID control signal rates. The proposed prediction
   model is capable of predicting the oil pipeline leaks and blocks several
   steps ahead which are used in the optimization part of the controller.
   Finally, the final output illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
   controller with a simulation example, employing real fluid pipeline
   pressure and flow rate data under a variety of hard constraints.

AB In the field of sports, the formulation of existing training plans
   mainly relies on the manual observation and personal experience of
   coaches. This method is inevitably subjective. The application of
   artificial intelligence technology to the training of athletes to
   recognize athletes' posture can help coaches assist in decision-making
   and greatly enhance athletes' competitive ability. The human body
   movements embodied in sports are more complicated, and the accurate
   recognition of sports postures plays an active and important role in
   sports competitions and training. In this paper, inertial sensor
   technology is applied to attitude recognition in motion. First, in order
   to improve the accuracy of attitude calculation and reduce the noise
   interference in the preparation process, this article uses differential
   evolution algorithm to apply attitude calculation to realize multisensor
   data fusion. Secondly, a two-level neural network intelligent motion
   gesture recognition algorithm is proposed. The two-level neural network
   intelligent recognition algorithm effectively recognizes similar actions
   by splitting the traditional single-level neural network into two-level
   neural networks. Experiments show that the experimental method designed
   in this article for the posture in motion can obtain the motion
   information of the examinee in real time, realize the accurate
   extraction of individual motion data, and complete the recognition of
   the motion posture. The average accuracy rate can reach 98.85%. There is
   a certain practical value in gesture recognition.

AB Recently, smart data has attracted great attention in the smart city
   community since it can provide valuable information to support
   intelligent services such as planning, monitoring, and decision making.
   However, it imposes a big challenge to explore smart data from big data
   gathered from smart city with various advanced fusion and analysis
   approaches. This paper proposes an incremental tensor-based fuzzy
   c-means approach (IT-FCM) for obtaining smart data from continuously
   generated big data. Specifically, a weighted version of the tensor-based
   fuzzy c-means approach (T-FCM) is firstly proposed to cluster the
   dataset that combines the previous cluster centroids and the new
   generated data. Aiming to improve the clustering efficiency, the old
   data objects are represented by the centroids to avoid repeat
   clustering. Furthermore, this paper presents an edge-cloud-aided
   clustering scheme to fuse big data from different sources and
   perspectives and further to implement co-clustering on the fused
   datasets for exploring smart data. Finally, the proposed IT-FCM approach
   is evaluated by comparing with T-FCM regarding clustering accuracy and
   efficiency on two different datasets in the experiments. The results
   state that IT-FCM outperforms T-FCM in clustering streaming big data in
   terms of accuracy and efficiency for obtaining smart data.

AB Modern cities face pressing problems with transportation systems
   including, but not limited to, traffic congestion, safety, health, and
   pollution. To tackle them, public administrations have implemented
   roadside infrastructures such as cameras and sensors to collect data
   about environmental and traffic conditions. In the case of traffic
   sensor data not only the real-time data are essential, but also
   historical values need to be preserved and published. When real-time and
   historical data of smart cities become available, everyone can join an
   evidence-based debate on the city's future evolution. The TRAFAIR
   (Understanding Traffic Flows to Improve Air Quality) project seeks to
   understand how traffic affects urban air quality. The project develops a
   platform to provide real-time and predicted values on air quality in
   several cities in Europe, encompassing tasks such as the deployment of
   low-cost air quality sensors, data collection and integration, modeling
   and prediction, the publication of open data, and the development of
   applications for end-users and public administrations. This paper
   explicitly focuses on the modeling and semantic annotation of traffic
   data. We present the tools and techniques used in the project and
   validate our strategies for data modeling and its semantic enrichment
   over two cities: Modena (Italy) and Zaragoza (Spain). An experimental
   evaluation shows that our approach to publish Linked Data is effective.

AB The need for in-depth and fast observation of waste pollutions, increase
   in public concerns on environmental pollution and the effect of polluted
   environment on the physical and mental health of people have led to
   participatory environmental monitoring and protection. Citizens can act
   as volunteer, interactive, group, logical, smart, responsible, mobile,
   and dispersed observers/sensors to constantly monitor their surroundings
   and provide real-time data of waste pollutions that are not easily
   remotely sensed. The concept of volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   can be adopted as an effective phenomenon for participatory collection
   of environmental pollution data. However, the research problem is how to
   effectively use these citizen-contributed or volunteered information for
   waste management analyses and decision-making processes. Consequently,
   the objective of the present study is to develop a VGI-based
   environmental decision support tool that facilitates direct involvement
   of the public in generating waste pollution data and provides
   appropriate GIS-MCDA (multicriteria decision analysis) analytical tools
   for waste management and decision making using the citizen-contributed
   data. A web-based prototype of the decision support system was developed
   to demonstrate the practical feasibility, applicability and some
   functionalities of the system for pollution-related decision analyses.

AB Humans who operate in high altitudes for prolonged durations often
   suffer from hypoxia. The commencement of physiological and cognitive
   changes due to the onset of hypoxia may not be immediately apparent to
   the exposed individual. These changes can go unrecognized for minutes
   and even hours and may lead to serious performance degradation or
   complete incapacitation. A dynamic system capable of monitoring and
   detecting decreased physiologic states due to the onset of hypoxia has
   the potential to prevent adverse outcomes. In this study, we develop a
   real-time hypoxia monitoring system based on a parallel M-ary decision
   fusion architecture. Blood oxygen saturation levels and altitude
   readings are the inputs and estimates of the level of hypoxia are the
   outputs. We develop new temporal evolution models for blood oxygen
   saturation and functional impairment with respect to varying altitude.
   The proposed models enable accurate tracking of various hypoxia levels
   based on the duration of stay of the subject at an altitude. Using a
   Bayesian decision-making formulation, the system generates global
   estimates of the degree of hypoxia. The detection system is tested
   against synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate applicability and
   accuracy.

AB Real-time information fusion based on WAMI (Wide-Area Motion Imagery),
   FMV (Full Motion Video), and text data is highly desired for many
   mission critical emergency or security applications. Cloud Computing has
   been considered promising to achieve big data integration from
   multi-modal sources. In many mission critical tasks, however, powerful
   Cloud technology cannot satisfy the tight latency tolerance as the
   servers are allocated far from the sensing platform. Therefore, data
   processing, information fusion, and decision making are required to be
   executed on-site (i.e., near the data collection). Fog Computing, a
   recently proposed extension and complement for Cloud Computing, enables
   computing on-site without outsourcing jobs to a remote Cloud. In this
   work, we have investigated the feasibility of processing streaming WAMI
   in the Fog for real-time, online, uninterrupted target tracking. Using a
   single target tracking algorithm, we studied the performance of a Fog
   Computing prototype. The experimental results are very encouraging that
   validate the effectiveness of our Fog approach to achieve real-time
   frame rates.

   the on-line transportation platform Digital Roadway Interactive
   Visualization and Evaluation Network (DRIVE Net) is developed in this
   study for the purpose of transportation data sharing, integration,
   visualization, and analysis. The major research goal of the DRIVE Net
   system can be summarized in threefold. First, it provides the repository
   service to facilitate data sharing and integration. Second, the system
   is capable of visualizing large sets of transportation data, helping
   users to perceive and understand the data. Third, the interactive and
   computational functionalities built into the DRIVE Net allow users to
   perform a variety of statistical modeling and analysis on multiple data
   sources, assisting with users to draw meaningful inferences and to make
   informed decisions. This research thus developed such an eScience
   platform addressing the aforementioned challenges for transportation
   applications. To particularly demonstrate the analytical capability of
   DRIVE Net, a new approach that automates real-time freeway performance

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) integrated with robotic systems is
   transforming oncologic surgery by significantly improving precision,
   safety, and personalization. The review critically explores the current
   landscape of AI-powered robotic technologies in tumor resection across
   various specialties, including urology, neurosurgery, orthopedics,
   pediatrics, and head and neck oncology. Despite rapid advancements,
   challenges remain in tumor boundary detection, real-time intraoperative
   navigation, motion compensation, and seamless data integration. Drawing
   on evidence from 22 recent clinical studies, pilot trials, and
   simulation-based research, the review identifies key innovations such as
   image-free robotic palpation, sensor-assisted feedback, 3D anatomical
   modeling, and adaptive motion management in radiotherapy. These
   technologies contribute to enhanced surgical accuracy, reduced
   invasiveness, and improved intraoperative decision-making. However,
   barriers such as inconsistent clinical protocols, limited
   cost-effectiveness data, and variability in performance across tumor
   types continue to hinder widespread adoption. Challenges persist in
   complex fields such as pediatric and neurosurgical oncology, where
   anatomical variability and safety concerns demand more advanced
   solutions. The review emphasizes the need for interoperable AI-robotic
   platforms, robust real-time analytics, and standardized safety
   frameworks. It also highlights the importance of ethical governance and
   clinician training in ensuring responsible implementation. In
   conclusion, AI-powered robotic surgery represents a major shift in
   oncology, offering the potential to improve long-term outcomes and
   reduce recurrence through data-driven, minimally invasive interventions.
   Realizing the potential will require interdisciplinary collaboration,
   longitudinal clinical validation, and strategic integration into
   healthcare systems.

AB Digital twins, having gained prominence in industrial sectors, are
   emerging in construction for enhancing intelligent management through
   real-time monitoring, performance simulation, and data integration.
   Despite their potential, systematic analysis of frameworks and enabling
   technologies remains lacking. This review systematically investigates
   over 150 studies to: (1) analyze the general framework and its
   extensions for building digital twins, and (2) evaluate enabling
   technologies and tools based on the modeling procedure. We propose a
   general structure for building digital twins and analyze frameworks
   centered on four data types derived from different sources. Our analysis
   indicates that different types of frameworks exhibit distinct
   characteristics and inherent limitations, yet a standardized framework
   for integrating heterogeneous data is still lacking. Through systematic
   analysis of enabling technologies across four key aspects of the
   modeling procedure, we investigate building digital twin cases regarding
   their modeling procedures, technologies employed, and common issues. We
   identify four key challenges: (1) limited prediction data integration
   and data analysis, restricting frameworks to monitoring rather than
   decision-supporting; (2) multi-source data heterogeneity and poor tool
   interoperability; (3) complex and non-standardized data integration
   procedures; and (4) low automation in model development. Future research
   should focus on: (1) standardizing data formats and interoperability
   tools, (2) developing unified platforms for multi-source data
   integration, and (3) integrating predictive analytics to enhance
   decision-making. This study establishes connections between frameworks
   and enabling technologies, identifies existing problems, and provides
   actionable recommendations to accelerate the adoption of building
   digital twins.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) offers innovative and efficient solutions
   to contemporary challenges in sustainable aquaculture. Machine learning
   (ML) and deep learning (DL) are integral components of smart
   aquaculture, driving significant advancements in the field. The
   integration of AI with ML, and DL technologies is transforming
   traditional aquaculture practices by enhancing operational efficiency,

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming water environment
   management, creating new opportunities for improved monitoring,
   prediction, and intelligent regulation of water quality. This review
   highlights the transformative impact of AI, particularly through hybrid
   modeling frameworks that integrate AI with technologies like the
   Internet of Things (IoT), Remote Sensing (RS), and Unmanned Monitoring
   Platforms (UMP). These advances have significantly enhanced real-time
   monitoring accuracy, expanded the scope of data acquisition, and enabled
   comprehensive analysis through multisource data fusion. Coupling AI
   models with process-based models (PBM) has notably enhanced predictive
   capabilities for simulating water quality dynamics. Additionally, AI
   facilitates dynamic early-warning systems, precise pollutant source
   tracking, and data-driven decision-making. However, significant
   challenges remain, including data quality and accessibility, model
   interpretability, monitoring of hard-to-measure pollutants, and the lack
   of system integration and standardization. To address these bottlenecks,
   future research should focus on: (1) constructing high-quality,
   standardized open-access datasets; (2) developing explainable AI (XAI)
   models; (3) strengthening integration with digital twins and
   next-generation sensors; (4) improving the monitoring of trace and
   emerging pollutants; and (5) coupling AI with PBM by optimizing input
   data, internal mechanisms, and correcting model outputs through
   validation against observations. Overcoming these challenges will
   position AI as a central pillar in advancing smart water quality
   governance, safeguarding water security, and achieving sustainable
   development goals.

AB The multi-sensor data fusion perception technology, as a pivotal
   technique for achieving complex environmental perception and
   decision-making, has been garnering extensive attention from
   researchers. To date, there has been a lack of comprehensive review
   articles discussing the research progress of multi-sensor fusion
   perception systems for embodied agents, particularly in terms of
   analyzing the agent's perception of itself and the surrounding scene. To
   address this gap and encourage further research, this study defines key
   terminology and analyzes datasets from the past two decades, focusing on
   advancements in multi-sensor fusion SLAM and multi-sensor scene
   perception. These key designs can aid researchers in gaining abetter
   understanding of the field and initiating research in the domain of
   multi-sensor fusion perception for embodied agents. In this survey, we
   begin with a brief introduction to common sensor types and their
   characteristics. We then delve into the multi-sensor fusion perception
   datasets tailored for the domains of autonomous driving, drones,
   unmanned ground vehicles, and unmanned surface vehicles. Following this,
   we discuss the classification and fundamental principles of existing
   multi-sensor data fusion SLAM algorithms, and present the experimental
   outcomes of various classical fusion frameworks. Subsequently, we
   comprehensively review the technologies of multi-sensor data fusion
   scene perception, including object detection, semantic segmentation,
   instance segmentation, and panoramic understanding. Finally, we
   summarize our findings and discuss potential future developments in
   multi-sensor fusion perception technology.

   Digital Twins (DTs) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The maritime
   industry faces significant challenges in maintaining ships due to issues
   like data silos, delayed information flow, and insufficient real-time
   updates. By leveraging advanced technologies such as DTs and IoT, this
   framework aims to optimize maintenance processes, improve
   decision-making, and increase the operational efficiency of maritime
   vessels. Digital Twins create virtual replicas of physical assets,
   allowing for continuous monitoring, simulation, and prediction of ship
   conditions. Meanwhile, IoT devices enable real-time data collection and
   transmission from various ship components, facilitating a seamless flow
   of information. This integrated approach enhances predictive maintenance
   capabilities, reduces downtime, and improves resource allocation. The
   article will delve into the architecture of the proposed framework,
   implementation steps, and potential challenges, supported by case
   studies that demonstrate its practical application and benefits. By
   addressing these aspects, the framework aims to provide a robust
   solution for modernizing ship maintenance operations and ensuring the

AB A Medical Cyber-Physical System represents a sophisticated healthcare
   framework seamlessly integrating cyber and physical elements to enhance
   medical processes and diagnostics. The integration of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare system has been pivotal in
   advancing intelligent medical cyber-physical systems and ushering in an
   era of advanced healthcare solutions. The paradigm of smart hospitals
   aspires to implement intelligent solutions seamlessly integrating
   hardware and software to control, supervise, and monitor patients while
   assisting healthcare professionals. Such solution is essential for smart
   decision-making and enhancing healthcare services. However, complete
   utilization of this intelligent medical cyber-physical system relies on
   an effective framework that should facilitate the interaction among
   patients, medical devices, AI services and hospital staff. This paper
   introduces a Digital Twin-based Smart Medical Cyber-Physical System
   (DT-MCPS) designed to enhance smart hospitals. Leveraging Digital Twins
   technology, DT-MCPS constructs a virtual replica of the hospital,
   facilitating precise control and supervision of patient care, coupled
   with service optimization through comprehensive data integration.
   DT-MCPS promotes personalized decision-making by seamlessly integrating
   medical records and real-time monitoring of physiological data, enabling
   predictive insights into disease progression. Moreover, DT-MCPS employs
   a model-based platform founded on web services to monitor the patient's
   state in real-time while accurately simulating the hospital medical
   systems workflows and contributing to long-term health management.
   Experimental results showcase the efficacy of DT-MCPS in enhancing
   hospitalization services, streamlining real-time control, and achieving
   highly precise personalized patient diagnostic.

AB In the context of decision-making, there is a growing demand for near
   real-time data that traditional solutions, like data warehousing based
   on long-running ETL processes, cannot fully meet. On the other hand,
   existing logical data integration solutions are challenging because
   users must focus on data location and distribution details rather than
   on data analytics and decision-making. EasyBDI is an open-source system
   that provides logical integration of data and high-level
   business-oriented abstractions. It uses schema matching, integration,
   and mapping techniques, to automatically identify partitioned data and
   propose a global schema. Users can then specify star schemas based on
   global entities and submit analytical queries to retrieve data from
   distributed data sources without knowing the organization and other
   technical details of the underlying systems. This work presents the
   algorithms and methods for global schema creation and query execution.
   Experimental results show that the overhead imposed by logical
   integration layers is relatively small compared to the execution times
   of distributed queries.

AB Multiphase flows are frequently found with oil/gas/water/sand in the oil
   & gas industries, in processes handling dry particulates such as
   fluidized bed and particulate flow and slurries and sedimentation, to
   quote a few industrial applications. All these processes have different
   flow regimes with characteristic distribution of the different materials
   in the flow. With increasing sensor data from processes and associated
   possibilities for data fusion, process tomography offers non-intrusive
   real time sensing methods for identifying these flow regimes, which in
   certain cases can lead to hazards to personnel and plants in the process
   industries. In this paper, two scenarios of control using process
   tomography are presented from the oil and gas industries and powder
   technology. Twin plane Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) with a
   plethora of other sensors for measuring pressure, flow rate in two phase
   flow involving water and air is one application. The other is
   particulate flow in a fluidized bed. In the case of water and air, ECT
   was used in a multiphase flow loop with different combinations of air
   and water mass flow rates enabling the generation of different flow
   regimes. In the case of particulate flow, different scenarios of flow
   conditions were generated using particulates and observing the flow
   regimes based on the distribution and flow rate of the particulates. For
   the identification of flow regimes, capacitance values from the
   12-electrode ECT module at a rate of 100 frames in 200ms, were logged in
   for data analytics. In the final stages of using the processed data, in
   the case of two-phase flow 5 outputs consisting of the identified flow
   regimes, viz. plug, slug, annular, stratified and wavy flows were used
   as inputs for control and decision making Similarly, in particulate flow
   ECT data were used to estimate the air velocity for fluidization as well
   as in identifying slug and plug flow, which are valuable to the process
   engineer in determining the range of air velocities for safe operation
   of the system used for particulate transport, often involving
   fluidization bed and pipelines. Tomography is used to discern features
   and tomometry is used in implementing the algorithms. Copyright (C) 2020

AB The correlated exploitation of disparate and heterogeneous data sources
   is important to the efficacy of many analytics tasks. Currently in
   application domains of major interest, such as in the maritime and
   aviation domains, available technology provides real time surveillance
   data from moving entities, which together with archival static data, can
   be processed in an integrated way to detect complex events and support
   decision making. The variety of data in disparate sources, the
   heterogeneity of data formats, as well as the volume of data, make data
   retrieval, integration, and especially reasoning with these data,
   challenging tasks. This paper presents an ontology-based distributed
   framework that addresses conjunctively these challenges: Data retrieval,
   integration and reasoning with data from heterogeneous static or
   regularly updated data sources. The proposed OBDAIR framework provides
   the means to support building scalable data-driven domain-specific
   applications that support decision-making and problem-solving. This is
   achieved by processing large volumes of heterogeneous data close to the
   sources, supporting knowledge generation in a distributed/decentralized
   but still unified manner. OBDAIR integrates modular ontology
   representation frameworks and ontology-based data access frameworks:
   This article presents an instantiation of OBDAIR using the modular
   ontology representation framework E - SHIQ, and the Ontop ontology-based
   access system. This OBDAIR instance has been evaluated at recognising
   important complex events in the maritime domain using real-world data.
   Experiments show the potential of OBDAIR to detect complex events in
   large geographic areas with computational efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier

AB Connected vehicles are capable of collecting, through their embedded
   sensors, and transmitting huge amounts of data at very high frequencies.
   Leveraging this data can be valuable for many entities: automobile
   manufacturer, vehicles owners, third parties, etc. Indeed, this "big
   data'' can be used in a large broad of services ranging from road safety
   services to aftermarket services (e.g., predictive and preventive
   maintenance). Nevertheless, processing and storing big data raised new
   scientific and technological challenges that traditional approaches
   cannot handle efficiently. In this paper, we address the issue of online
   (i.e., near real-time) data processing of automotive information. More
   precisely, we focus on the performance of data fusion to support several
   millions of connected vehicles. In order to face this performance
   challenge, we propose novel approaches, based on spatial indexation, to
   speed up our automotive application. To validate the effectiveness of
   our proposal, we have implemented and conducted real experiments on PSA
   Group (PSA Group is the second-largest automobile manufacturer in Europe
   with about 3 million sold vehicles in 2015) big data streaming platform.
   The experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency of our spatial
   indexing and querying techniques.

AB The evolution of sensor node capabilities makes distributed data fusion
   possible in autonomous wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for various
   purposes. We propose a framework of task-oriented distributed data
   fusion, and investigate the assignments of heterogeneous sensors on
   nodes in the network, so that system performance can adapt the dynamics
   of tasks and the topology of self-organised networks. This work provides
   an approach to improving the fusion performance based on partial
   information from WSNs. Such a task-oriented autonomous wireless sensor
   network can be a part of the infrastructure for cloud computing through
   the Internet. A hierarchy of linguistic decision trees is used to map
   the distributed information fusion. The performance evaluation is done
   from five aspects, quality of estimates, computing scalability,
   real-time performance, data flow, and energy consumption. Four classic
   decision-making problems in the UCI machine learning repository are used
   as the virtual measures from WSNs to demonstrate the merits of the
   proposed system compared with the central fusion models.

AB In the field of group decision-making (GDM), the complex heterogeneous
   data continuously challenges the traditional single decision-making
   model, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods in handling
   multidimensional data and dynamic scenarios. Although information fusion
   is of great significance for GDM, there are still significant
   deficiencies in existing research within the framework of multi-scale
   information systems (MSIS). In particular, there is an urgent need to
   address the challenges of dealing with multi-structural data and
   managing the complex behaviors of decision-makers (DMs). Firstly, a
   novel concept, the heterogeneous multi-scale information system (HMSIS),
   is put forward. This system innovatively integrates utility value
   quantification analysis, fuzzy preference relation modeling, preference
   ranking algorithms, and equivalence class partitioning techniques,
   thereby constructing a highly realistic simulation framework for
   real-world data. Through this cross-paradigm data integration approach,
   the HMSIS provides a more adaptable and scalable theoretical foundation
   for GDM, effectively resolving the limitations of traditional models in
   handling complex data structures. Building on this foundation, this
   paper further develops the consensus-trust multi-network opinion
   interaction mechanism. This mechanism shatters the constraints of
   one-way information transmission in traditional decision-making
   processes. By devising an adaptive opinion exchange protocol, it enables
   multi-round and multi-dimensional information interactions among
   decision-makers. Additionally, innovative behavior monitoring and
   intervention rules are introduced, which can detect irrational behaviors
   of DMs, such as overconfidence and non-cooperation, in real time.
   Through dynamic weight adjustment, intelligent guidance strategies, and
   other means, targeted management is implemented to ensure the stability
   and effectiveness of the group decision-making process. Moreover, this
   paper constructs an optimized consensus reaching process (CRP). By
   embedding an optimization model and under the intelligent regulation of
   a virtual decision-making coordinator, it optimizes both the efficiency
   of decision-making information transmission and the accuracy of opinion
   convergence simultaneously. With the core objectives of minimizing the
   decision adjustment distance and shortening the consensus-reaching time,
   and combined with a dynamic weight allocation algorithm, this model
   achieves efficient and fair consensus building in complex
   decision-making environments. Finally, empirical studies conducted on a
   real-world dataset demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the
   proposed method. The experimental results further validate the method's
   robust performance in handling heterogeneous data and complex
   decision-making scenarios.

AB Technological advances are providing farmers with valuable data about
   their crops. However, to improve resource use efficiency in agriculture,
   it is necessary to transform this data into practical information,
   applicable by farmers and/or technicians in crop management. The
   objective of this work was to develop a fully automated IoT platform
   that integrates crop images from RGB cameras with open climate data
   sources and crop models, to optimize irrigation strategies and enhance
   crop productivity under varying environmental conditions. To achieve
   this, the AquaCrop-IoT platform was developed, which integrates the
   FAO's AquaCrop model with a custombuild image capture and processing
   system, used to adjust the green canopy cover (CC) in real-time.
   Additionally, the platform incorporates weather data from in-situ
   weather stations, and forecasts and historical weather data from open
   datasets. Everything is presented in a web application that facilitates
   its use. The platform has been tested in a wheat crop in southern Spain
   throughout its growth cycle, demonstrating its potential as a decision
   support system for irrigation management. Dynamically updating CC values
   using images captured by the in-situ camera enabled the AquaCrop model
   to correct potential errors in crop growth estimation by including the
   effects of adverse factors like pests and diseases that the model cannot
   simulate. Furthermore, as the developed platform incorporates
   meteorological data daily, in real-time, it allowed the design of
   real-time irrigation schedules tailored to the crop in its particular
   environment and management. This approach improved the estimation of
   crop water requirements, reducing the amount of recommended irrigation
   water during the wheat growing season by approximately 32%.

AB In the oil and gas IIoT environment, fire detection systems heavily
   depend on fire sensor data, which can be prone to inaccuracies due to
   faulty or unreliable sensors. These sensor issues, such as noise,
   missing values, outliers, sensor drift, and faulty readings, can lead to
   delayed or missed fire predictions, posing significant safety and
   operational risks in the oil and gas industrial IoT environment. This
   paper presents an approach for handling faulty sensors in edge servers
   within an IIoT environment to enhance the reliability and accuracy of
   fire prediction through multi-sensor fusion preprocessing, machine
   learning (ML)-driven probabilistic model adjustment, and uncertainty
   handling. First, a real-time anomaly detection and statistical
   assessment mechanism is employed to preprocess sensor data, filtering
   out faulty readings and normalizing data from multiple sensor types
   using dynamic thresholding, which adapts to sensor behavior in
   real-time. The proposed approach also deploys machine learning
   algorithms to dynamically adjust probabilistic models based on real-time
   sensor reliability, thereby improving prediction accuracy even in the
   presence of unreliable sensor data. A belief mass assignment mechanism
   is introduced, giving more weight to reliable sensors to ensure they
   have a stronger influence on fire detection. Simultaneously, a dynamic
   belief update strategy continuously adjusts sensor trust levels,
   reducing the impact of faulty readings over time. Additionally,
   uncertainty measurements using Hellinger and Deng entropy, along with
   Dempster-Shafer Theory, enable the integration of conflicting sensor
   inputs and enhance decision-making in fire detection. This approach
   improves decision-making by managing sensor discrepancies and provides a
   reliable solution for real-time fire predictions, even in the presence
   of faulty sensor readings, thereby mitigating the fire risks in IIoT
   environments.

AB In many places across the world, air pollution is a serious problem.
   Citizen-collaborative air quality monitoring and forecasting systems are
   gaining popularity as a potential solution. Community platforms with
   online air quality maps made by individuals offer a way to include
   people in environmental monitoring, increase public awareness of air
   pollution exposure, and support the growth of smart cities. The notion
   of smart cities places significant emphasis on the utility of technology
   in enhancing urban planning and management, as well as data-driven
   decision-making. Systems for citizen collaborative air quality
   monitoring and forecasting support this idea by giving residents of the
   city a means of gathering and evaluating data on air quality in real
   time. The article explores the role of social innovation techniques,
   such as co-creation and participatory sensing, in engaging citizens and
   raising awareness. Furthermore, these systems can contribute to the
   creation of smart cities that are more long-term sustainable and
   responsive to the demands of their residents by involving citizens and
   making use of technology. In conclusion, the combination of tools and

AB The construction industry's reliance on traditional methods and
   fragmented workflows results in significant information loss,
   inefficiencies, increased costs, and errors. This study addresses these
   issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building
   information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow
   throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that
   synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national
   and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and
   analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a
   conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and
   interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting
   open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for
   effective information exchange. By implementing an information model
   (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit
   processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory
   compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated
   information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction
   practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research
   illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize
   the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and
   fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust
   framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency
   and accuracy of construction processes.

AB In Industry 4.0, factory assets and machines are equipped with sensors
   that collect data for effective condition monitoring. This is a
   difficult task since it requires the integration and processing of
   heterogeneous data from different sources, with different temporal
   resolutions and underlying meanings. Ontologies have emerged as a
   pertinent method to deal with data integration and to represent
   manufacturing knowledge in a machine-interpretable way through the
   construction of semantic models. Ontologies are used to structure
   knowledge in knowledge bases, which also contain instances and
   information about these data. Thus, a knowledge base provides a sort of
   virtual representation of the different elements involved in a
   manufacturing process. Moreover, the monitoring of industrial processes
   depends on the dynamic context of their execution. Under these
   circumstances, the semantic model must provide a way to represent this
   evolution in order to represent in which situation(s) a resource is in
   during the execution of its tasks to support decision making.
   This paper proposes a semantic framework to address the evolution of
   knowledge bases for condition monitoring in Industry 4.0. To this end,
   firstly we propose a semantic model (the COInd4 ontology) for the
   manufacturing domain that represents the resources and processes that
   are part of a factory, with special emphasis on the context of these
   resources and processes. Relevant situations that combine sensor
   observations with domain knowledge are also represented in the model.
   Secondly, an approach that uses stream reasoning to detect these
   situations that lead to potential failures is introduced. This approach
   enriches data collected from sensors with contextual information using
   the proposed semantic model. The use of stream reasoning facilitates the
   integration of data from different data sources, different temporal
   resolutions as well as the processing of these data in real time. This
   allows to derive high-level situations from lower-level context and
   sensor information. Detecting situations can trigger actions to adapt
   the process behavior, and in turn, this change in behavior can lead to
   the generation of new contexts leading to new situations. These
   situations can have different levels of severity, and can be nested in
   different ways. Dealing with the rich relations among situations
   requires an efficient approach to organize them. Therefore, we propose a
   method to build a lattice, ordering those situations depending on the
   constraints they rely on. This lattice represents a road-map of all the
   situations that can be reached from a given one, normal or abnormal.
   This helps in decision support, by allowing the identification of the
   actions that can be taken to correct the abnormality avoiding in this
   way the interruption of the manufacturing processes. Finally, an
   industrial application scenario for the proposed approach is described.

AB This article presents a novel approach to wildfire risk assessment and
   behaviour prediction by leveraging open geospatial data and ontologies.
   The proposed methodology includes a spatially weighted index model and
   multicriteria analysis to represent the risk of forest fires in the
   affected area. It bridges gaps in theory and practice, offering a
   comprehensive solution for evaluating potential forest fire risk in near
   real time, predicting fire behaviour and elucidating the semantics of
   fire management. During dry and hot conditions, forest fires tend to
   escalate. Hence, we propose an algorithm that combines experts'
   empirical criteria and open-source data to identify dangerous fires in
   near real time, aiding authorities in directing attention to the
   riskiest areas. The objective is to predict forest fire behaviour, a
   complex and nonlinear system influenced by dynamic factors such as
   weather conditions, topography and land use. Our methodology enables
   real-time assessment of potential forest fire risks, complemented by
   predictive fire behaviour scenarios and a descriptive ontology of fire
   management semantics. We examine existing fire-related ontologies and
   propose a comprehensive one encompassing incident descriptions,
   firefighting resources, actor interrelations and knowledge for effective
   action. By classifying fire sources, our algorithm enables strategic
   decision-making to prevent uncontrolled fires. This solution
   significantly enhances data using semantic and spatial relationships
   among wildfire resources. Furthermore, we demonstrate how ontologies
   improve data integration and interoperability among diverse systems and
   organisations involved in forest fire risk management, fostering better
   coordination and faster responses to critical situations. To facilitate
   decision-making, we create decision-making scenarios linked to analysed
   hot spots, drawing from open hot spot data such as National Aeronautics
   and Space Administration (NASA) Fire Information for Resource Management
   System (FIRMS), OpenStreetMap (OSM), OpenWeatherMap (OWM) and
   OpenTopoData (OTD). We propose an ordinal and linguistic classification
   system (F1-F5) denoting risk levels as low, moderate, high, very high
   and extreme. These values are obtained through factor aggregation and
   fuzzy logic. A publicly accessible, interactive web map displays the
   results derived from this model. Overall, our contributions to wildfire
   risk management provide authorities with a valuable tool to make
   informed decisions and mitigate the damaging effects of wildfires.

AB This paper is to explore the problems of intelligent connected vehi-cles
   (ICVs) autonomous driving decision-making under a 5G-V2X structured road
   environment. Through literature review and interviews with autonomous
   driving practitioners, this paper firstly puts forward a logical
   framework for designing a cerebrum-like autonomous driving system.
   Secondly, situated on this framework, it builds a hierarchical finite
   state machine (HFSM) model as well as a TOPSIS-GRA algorithm for making
   ICV autonomous driving decisions by employing a data fusion approach
   between the entropy weight method (EWM) and analytic hierarchy process
   method (AHP) and by employ-ing a model fusion approach between the
   technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution
   (TOPSIS) and grey relational analysis (GRA). The HFSM model is composed
   of two layers: the global FSM model and the local FSM model. The
   decision of the former acts as partial input information of the latter
   and the result of the latter is sent forward to the local path -planning
   module, meanwhile pulsating feedback to the former as real-time refresh
   data. To identify different traffic scenarios in a cerebrum-like way,
   the global FSM model is designed as 7 driving behavior states and 17
   driving characteristic events, and the local FSM model is designed as 16
   states and 8 characteristic events. In respect to designing a
   cerebrum-like algorithm for state transition, this paper firstly fuses
   AHP weight and EWM weight at their output layer to generate a synthetic
   weight coefficient for each characteristic event; then, it further fuses
   TOPSIS method and GRA method at the model building layer to obtain the
   implementable order of state transition. To verify the feasibility,
   reliability, and safety of the HFSM model as well as its TOPSIS-GRA
   state transition algorithm, this paper elaborates on a series of
   simulative experiments conducted on the PreScan8.50 platform. The
   results display that the accuracy of obstacle detection gets 98%, lane
   line prediction is beyond 70 m, the speed of collision avoidance is
   higher than 45 km/h, the distance of collision avoidance is less than 5
   m, path planning time for obstacle avoidance is averagely less than 50
   ms, and brake deceleration is controlled under 6 m/s2. These technical
   indexes support that the driving states set and characteristic events
   set for the HFSM model as well as its TOPSIS-GRA algorithm may bring
   about cerebrum-like decision-making effectiveness for ICV autonomous
   driving under 5G-V2X intelligent road infrastructure.

AB Global Change challenges are now systematically recognized and tackled
   in a growingly coordinated manner by intergovernmental organizations
   such as the United Nations. Heterogeneous observing networks provide the
   founded data sources to assess the Earth environmental status and take
   sound decisions to achieve a sustainable development. WMO Hydrological
   Observing System (WHOS) allows to discover and access historical and
   near real time hydrological observations. WHOS represents the
   hydrological contribution to the wider WIGOS-WIS system of WMO. It is a
   digital ecosystems framework contributed by a set of data providers and
   technical support centers. In this framework, three regional pilots were
   successfully completed. The WHOS architecture applies the services
   brokering style, implemented through the Discovery and Access Broker
   technology. A brokering approach makes a global system of systems
   possible and sustainable, where the different enterprise systems are
   enabled to interoperate, despite they implement heterogeneous
   communication interfaces and data models. In this manuscript, the WHOS
   brokering solution is detailed by recurring to the definition of a set
   of transversal viewpoints to describe the important aspects of the
   complex ecosystem -namely: enterprise, information, computational,
   engineering, and technological views. Finally, the three regional pilot
   ecosystems are described as successful cases of WHOS implementation.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has penetrating all things and objects
   around us giving them the ability to interact with the Internet, i.e.,
   things become Smart Things (SThs). As a result, SThs produce massive
   real-time data (i.e., big IoT data). Smartness of IoT applications bases
   mainly on services such as automatic control, events handling, and
   decision making. Consumers of the IoT services are not only human users,
   but also SThs. Consequently, the potential of IoT applications relies on
   supporting services such as searching, retrieving, mining, analyzing,
   and sharing real-time data. For enhancing search service in the IoT, our
   previous work presents a promising solution, called Cluster
   Representative (ClRe), for indexing similar SThs in IoT applications.
   ClRe algorithms could reduce similar indexing by O(K - 1), where K is
   number of Time Series (TS) in a cluster. Multiple extensions for ClRe
   algorithms were presented in another work for enhancing accuracy of
   indexed data. In this theme, this paper studies performance analysis of
   ClRe algorithms, proposes two novel execution methods: (a) Linear
   execution (LE) and (b) Pair-merge execution (PME), and studies sorting
   impact on TS execution for enhancing similarity rate for some ClRe
   extensions. The proposed execution methods are evaluated with real
   examples and proved using Szeged-weather dataset on ClRe 3.0 and its
   extensions; where they produce representatives with higher similarities
   compared to the other extensions. Evaluation results indicate that PME
   could improve performance of ClRe 3.0 by = 20.5%, ClRe 3.1 by = 17.7%,
   and ClRe 3.2 by = 6.4% in average.

AB Efficient management of smart transport systems requires the integration
   of various sensing technologies, as well as fast processing of a high
   volume of heterogeneous data, in order to perform smart analytics of
   urban networks in real time. However, dynamic response that relies on
   intelligent demand-side transport management is particularly challenging
   due to the increasing flow of transmitted sensor data. In this work, a
   novel smart service-driven, adaptable middleware architecture is
   proposed to acquire, store, manipulate, and integrate information from
   heterogeneous data sources in order to deliver smart analytics aimed at
   supporting strategic decision-making. The architecture offers adaptive
   and scalable data integration services for acquiring and processing
   dynamic data, delivering fast response time, and offering data mining
   and machine learning models for real-time prediction, combined with
   advanced visualisation techniques. The proposed solution has been
   implemented and validated, demonstrating its ability to provide
   real-time performance on the existing, operational, and large-scale bus
   network of a European capital city.

AB Despite recent advances in hydrological models and observation
   technology, the prediction of floods using advanced models and data has
   not yet been fully implemented for practical use. The major issues in
   prediction originate from the underlying uncertainty of the initial
   conditions of the basin and the accuracy of the precipitation forecast.
   Effective transmission of flood information to corresponding authorities
   is also necessary when considering countermeasures against an oncoming
   flood. We present in this article a data archive and model integrated
   system to overcome these issues. The system realizes flood forecasting
   by employing a land surface model coupled with hydrological model and an
   ensemble precipitation forecast model to address the accuracy of initial
   conditions and precipitation. While the Water and Energy Budget Based
   Distributed Hydrological Model (WEBDHM) rigorously estimates the
   physical state of the basin, the ensemble precipitation forecast model
   analyzes historical errors in forecasts and returns precipitation
   ensembles reflecting the uncertainty in the forecast specifically
   regarding the target basin. A combination of these models yields an
   ensemble of stream-flow forecasts. We further develop a virtual
   reservoir simulator to enhance the proactive use of forecast information
   to support decision making by reservoir managers. These models are
   integrated into the Data Integration Analysis System (DIAS). The
   feasibility of the system for practical use is tested against data from
   recent typhoon events.

AB With the integration of technological advances within interconnected
   systems, digital twins (DTs) are playing an increasingly vital role in
   optimizing operations, enhancing decision-making, and driving innovation
   across diverse industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, and
   transportation. They offer immense potential to address one of the
   fastest growing concerns in today's technological landscape, i.e.,
   cybersecurity. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of 300
   publications, employing a mixed-method approach that includes BERTopic
   modeling and case studies to explore the dynamic relationship between
   DTs and cybersecurity. Five topics emerged-DTs in IoT environments,
   critical infrastructure, energy systems, AI-enhanced DTs, and sectoral
   efficiency-which reflect how cybersecurity capabilities are implemented
   across diverse industries to drive performance and resilience. Our
   findings include 13 case studies illustrating the real-world impact of
   DTs in enhancing real-time threat detection, anomaly analysis, and
   adaptive response. Notably, while DT applications in smart manufacturing
   and energy systems significantly increase operational efficiency and
   resilience, challenges persist in data integration, scalability, and
   standardization. Informed by these insights, we propose a
   forward-looking cybersecurity framework designed to unify cross-domain
   challenges and solutions observed in the literature. Unlike existing
   studies that remain sector bound, our framework aims to consolidate
   shared cybersecurity mechanisms-such as anomaly detection, AI
   integration, and data governance-into a coherent, actionable structure
   applicable across DT ecosystems. This contribution not only synthesizes
   fragmented research but also advances the theoretical understanding by
   addressing the pressing need for scalable, interoperable, and secure DT
   infrastructures. Furthermore, our analysis maps these advancements with
   UN Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9) and its subgoals SDG 9.1, SDG
   9.4 and SDG 9.5. This study highlights critical gaps in intelligent data
   governance, standardization, and cybersecurity implementation across
   sectors and argues for a unified framework to guide future research and
   practice in secure DT development.

AB The digital transformation of the Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction sector is accelerating the adoption of digital platforms as
   critical enablers of data integration, stakeholder collaboration and
   process optimization. This paper presents a systematic review of 125
   peer-reviewed journal articles (2015-2025), selected through a
   PRISMA-guided search using the Scopus database, with inclusion criteria
   focused on English-language academic literature on platform-enabled
   digitalization in the built environment. Studies were grouped into six
   thematic domains, i.e., artificial intelligence in construction, digital
   twin integration, lifecycle cost management, BIM-GIS for underground
   utilities, energy systems and public administration, based on a
   combination of literature precedent and domain relevance. Unlike
   existing reviews focused on single technologies or sectors, this work
   offers a cross-sectoral synthesis, highlighting shared challenges and
   opportunities across disciplines and lifecycle stages. It identifies the
   functional roles, enabling technologies and systemic barriers affecting
   digital platform adoption, such as fragmented data sources, limited
   interoperability between systems and siloed organizational processes.
   These barriers hinder the development of integrated and adaptive digital
   ecosystems capable of supporting real-time decision-making,
   participatory planning and sustainable infrastructure management. The
   study advocates for modular, human-centered platforms underpinned by
   standardized ontologies, explainable AI and participatory governance
   models. It also highlights the importance of emerging technologies,
   including large language models and federated learning, as well as
   context-specific platform strategies, especially for applications in the

AB Multimodal bioelectronics has enabled comprehensive understanding of
   complex biological states by capturing diverse biosignals and
   interacting with the physiological changes with the biological
   environment. These systems are categorized into multi-sensing devices,
   which collect and analyze multiple biosignals concurrently, and
   multifunctional devices, which provide dynamic feedback through
   mechanisms such as drug release, electrical stimulation, and mechanical
   actuation. However, the acquisition and integrated analysis of
   heterogeneous data from these biosensors pose significant computational
   challenges, necessitating advanced analytical frameworks to extract
   meaningful insights. Machine learning has emerged as an essential tool
   for data interpretation and real-time decision-making through addressing

   introduces both challenges and opportunities for Artificial Intelligence
   (AI)-driven analytics. Effectively managing the complexity and
   variability of these data sources requires advanced computational
   techniques for accurate interpretation and robust decisionmaking.
   Integrating AI with colorimetric biosensing and multimodal data fusion
   offers scalable solutions that can improve diagnostic accuracy, enable
   early disease detection, and support personalized medicine. This work
   explores mobile-based colorimetry, an AI-driven approach that uses image
   processing and Machine Learning (ML) to detect colorimetric changes in

   framework that integrates mobile-based colorimetry with multimodal
   biomedical data, such as clinical, imaging, and environmental datasets,
   to develop scalable, low-cost tools for predictive modeling, real-time
   health monitoring, and personalized diagnostics. We review recent
   advancements in AI-enabled colorimetric analysis and multimodal data
   fusion for healthcare applications, emphasizing innovations in
   ML-assisted biosensors, AI-driven biomedical imaging, and multimodal
   fusion techniques. In addition, we highlight the need for robust data
   management systems and interpretable AI/ML models to ensure security,

AB With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
   the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is becoming increasingly important in
   intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). At the same time, large
   language models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) are gradually playing
   significant roles in the IoV. Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are models capable
   of integrating multiple modalities of information, enhancing the
   environmental perception capabilities of the IoV. GenAI can generate
   highly complex virtual driving scenarios, which are used to test and
   optimize intelligent driving algorithms, reducing the risks and costs of
   real-world road testing. Embodied AI can interact with the environment
   and make decisions, and can learn in the simulated environments that are
   provided by GenAI. To address issues like low correlation of multimodal
   data, high-uncertainty of driving environment, and insufficient
   intelligence in the IoV, this article proposes a perception and
   decision-making system empowered by embodied AI. First, we utilize a
   transformer to achieve multimodal data fusion integrated with
   vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data. Second, the MLLM analyzes the situation
   based on driving intentions, communication conditions, and the perceived
   environmental expressions. Finally, the MLLM makes the optimal decisions
   and adjustments based on the analysis. The experimental results show
   that the integration of V2V enables the IoV to more comprehensively
   perceive a complex driving environment. The MLLM can empower the IoV to
   make accurate decisions in high-uncertainty scenarios, significantly
   improving route completion rates.

AB With advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT),
   traditional manufacturing industries are engaged in a digital
   transformation. This transformation enables the acquisition of vast
   amounts of data and information, enhancing decision-making capabilities.
   This, in turn, has raised the expectations of field operators who seek
   data and information management tailored to the dynamic working
   environment, thereby improving efficiency in their daily operations.
   However, there is a lack of a holistic approach to integrating diverse
   data sources, extracting valuable contextual information, and delivering
   real-time information to field operators. This paper addresses this gap
   by proposing an adaptive, interoperable, and user-centered Context-Aware
   System (CAS). Initially, the paper explores the challenges and
   requirements associated with CAS's current practices while proposing
   potential solutions. Furthermore, it introduces a system framework of
   CAS that integrates Digital Twin (DT) and semantic technologies. This
   framework includes three primary technical solutions: (1) Integrating DT
   to create a comprehensive digital representation of physical entities,
   enabling real-time data integration and synchronization; (2) Providing
   an ontology-based approach to model manufacturing context, facilitating
   knowledge representation and reasoning; (3) Developing a user-centered
   information delivery system leveraging Augmented Reality (AR) for
   context-aware visualization. The system architecture has been
   implemented and tested in a laboratory-scale industrial environment,
   focusing on crane operations within logistics scenarios. Lastly, three
   use cases are presented to demonstrate the system's practical
   applicability, showcasing its feasibility in furnishing informed
   contextual information to end-users within the dynamic manufacturing
   environment.

AB Value engineering (VE) has the potential to increase sustainability in
   buildings by optimizing function-to-cost ratios. However, outdated
   manual procedures limit integration and consistency in construction
   projects, necessitating the evaluation of VE automation. This review
   examines VE automation in building design and construction. A systematic
   analysis of 664 publications from major databases was conducted,
   yielding 136 relevant articles. Bibliometric analysis using descriptive
   statistics and keyword mapping identified key VE methodologies and
   building types. Key technologies in VE automation include BIM, advanced
   algorithms, and data integration. These tools enable automated layout
   generation, material selection, and technical configurations, enhancing
   value optimization. BIM serves as a central data platform, improving
   stakeholder collaboration. Algorithms rapidly generate design
   alternatives, optimizing decision-making. Data integration ensures
   accuracy across project stages. Challenges include incomplete databases,
   lifecycle integration issues, and resistance to change. A continuous
   digital VE framework is proposed to address these barriers. This
   framework emphasizes the seamless integration of VE tools with BIM
   platforms, enhancing interoperability and user engagement. In the
   future, there will be further opportunities to advance VE automation
   through the creation of more advanced predictive analytics algorithms,
   more real-time data processing capabilities, and increased
   interoperability amongst various digital tools. The integration of
   machine learning and artificial intelligence into VE processes is also
   suggested to further enhance optimization and efficiency in construction

AB Patient care, research, and decision-making are all aided by real-time
   medical data analysis in today's rapidly developing healthcare system.
   The significance of this research comes in the fact that it has the
   ability to completely change the healthcare system by relocating
   computing resources closer to the data source, hence facilitating more
   rapid and accurate analysis of medical data. Latency, privacy concerns,
   and inability to scale are common in traditional cloud-centric
   techniques. With their ability to process data close to where it is
   created, edge and fog computing have the potential to revolutionize
   medical analysis. The healthcare industry has unique opportunities and
   problems for the application of edge and fog computing. There must be an
   emphasis on data security and privacy, workload flexibility,
   interoperability, resource optimization, and data integration without
   any interruptions. In this research, it is suggested the Adaptive
   Heuristic Edge assisted Fog Computing design (AHE-FCD) to solve these
   issues using a novel architecture meant to improve medical analysis.
   Together, edge devices and fog nodes may perform distributed data
   processing and analytics with the help of AHE-FCD. Heuristic algorithms
   are often employed for optimization issues that establishing an optimum
   solution using standard approaches is difficult and impossible.
   Heuristic algorithms utilize search algorithms to explore the search
   space and identify a result. Improved patient care, medical research,
   and healthcare process efficiency are all possible to AHE-FCD real-time,
   low-latency analysis at the edge and fog layers. Improved medical
   analysis with minimal latency, high reliability, and data privacy are
   all likely to emerge from the study's findings. As a result, rather from
   being centralized, operations in a sophisticated distributed system
   occur at several end points. That helps the situation quicker to detect
   possible dangers prior to propagate across the network. The AHE-FCD is a
   promising breakthrough that moves us closer to the realization of
   advanced medical analysis systems, where prompt and well-informed
   decision-making is essential to providing excellent healthcare.

AB In the context of the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT)
   technology and the extensive proliferation of the global Internet, the
   authenticity of data has become a focal point of societal demand. It
   plays a decisive role in enhancing the quality of decision-making and
   operational efficiency. However, the storage and authenticity
   verification of large-scale IoT real-time data present unprecedented
   technical challenges. Faced with the inherent data security risks of
   traditional centralized cloud storage, blockchain technology reveals its
   unique potential for solutions with its inherent immutability and
   decentralization. Nevertheless, current blockchainbased data storage
   solutions are still restricted by high costs and inefficiency. To
   address these challenges, this paper innovatively proposes the BI-TSFID
   framework, which leverages the benefits of Ethereum and IPFS and
   optimizes the Merkle Tree structure and verification mechanisms. The
   BI-TSFID framework adopts a strategy of on-chain data summary storage
   and off-chain computation. This approach provides IoT with efficient and
   reliable data storage, reduces operational costs, and simplifies the
   verification process. This research has improved the data computation
   efficiency by refining the structure of the Merkle Tree and analyzed its
   optimal branch number. Additionally, the study introduces a
   sampling-based data integrity verification method that significantly
   reduces resource consumption during the verification process.
   Experimental results show that the solutions proposed in this paper
   effectively enhance the efficiency and security of IoT data management
   and provide valuable guidance for the theory and practice of real-time
   data storage and verification, further promoting the development and
   innovation in the related technological fields.

   more attractive deals, and analyzing negative customer comments to see
   if it can outperform its rivals. The trial results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of this method of making marketing decisions and
   formulating a strategy. Hence, the BD-ECBM technique improves customers'
   overall satisfaction and experience with the brand while raising the

AB Transformers and circuit breakers are essential equipment in traction
   power supply systems. Once a fault occurs, it will affect the train's
   regular operation and even threaten passengers' personal safety.
   Therefore, it is essential to diagnose the faults of the transformers
   and circuit breakers of the traction power supply system. At present,
   power companies have made many achievements in fault diagnosis of power
   equipment, but there are still problems with real-time and accuracy. The
   Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that connects different types
   of terminal devices for information exchange and communication to
   achieve intelligence. It includes data acquisition and transmission,
   information interaction, processing, and decision-making from bottom to
   top. It uses sensor terminals to obtain real-time status information on
   electrical equipment. Moreover, it conducts real-time monitoring and
   intelligent processing of the equipment status of the traction power
   supply system. In this paper, the multi-data fusion technology of the
   IoT combines the real-time information of electrical equipment with
   fault diagnosis to realize the fault diagnosis of transformers and
   circuit breakers. First, we built an equipment fault diagnosis system
   based on the multi-terminal data fusion technology of the IoT. Secondly,
   the transformer fault diagnosis model is established. We adopt the BP
   neural network algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
   realize transformer fault diagnosis and use PSO to optimize the feature
   subset to improve the diagnosis performance. Finally, the fault
   diagnosis model of the vacuum circuit breaker is established. We select
   the current change and time node as typical fault feature quantities and
   use the PSO-BP neural network algorithm to realize the fault diagnosis
   of the circuit breaker.

AB IntroductionA growing number of healthcare providers make complex
   treatment decisions guided by electronic health record (EHR) software
   interfaces. Many interfaces integrate multiple sources of data (e.g.,
   labs, pharmacy, diagnoses) successfully, though relatively few have
   incorporated genetic data. MethodThis study utilizes informatics methods
   with predictive modeling to create and validate algorithms to enable
   informed pharmacogenomic decision-making at the point of care in near
   real-time. The proposed framework integrates EHR and genetic data
   relevant to the patient's current medications including decision support
   mechanisms based on predictive modeling. We created a prototype with EHR
   and linked genetic data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),
   the largest integrated healthcare system in the US. The EHR data
   included diagnoses, medication fills, and outpatient clinic visits for
   2,600 people with HIV and matched uninfected controls linked to
   prototypic genetic data (variations in single or multiple positions in
   the DNA sequence). We then mapped the medications that patients were
   prescribed to medications defined in the drug-gene interaction mapping
   of the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium's (CPIC)
   level A (i.e., sufficient evidence for at least one prescribing action)
   guidelines that predict adverse events. CPIC is a National Institute of
   Health funded group of experts who develop evidence based
   pharmacogenomic guidelines. Preventable adverse events (PAE) can be
   defined as a harmful outcome from an intervention that could have been
   prevented. For this study, we focused on potential PAEs resulting from a
   medication-gene interaction. ResultsThe final model showed AUC scores of
   0.972 with an F1 score of 0.97 with genetic data as compared to 0.766
   and 0.73 respectively, without genetic data integration. DiscussionOver
   98% of people in the cohort were on at least one medication with CPIC
   level a guideline in their lifetime. We compared predictive power of
   machine learning models to detect a PAE between five modeling methods:
   Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting
   (XGBoost), K Nearest neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. We found that
   XGBoost performed best for the prototype when genetic data was added to
   the framework and improved prediction of PAE. We compared area under the
   curve (AUC) between the models in the testing dataset.

AB To replace current legacy inspection/maintenance methods with autonomous
   real-time health status tracking, the paper proposes a smart robotic
   system with integrated remaining useful life (RUL) prediction tailored
   for complex components, structures and systems (CSSs). Capabilities like
   artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) utilizing sensing
   data along with other monitoring data assist in maintenance
   optimization. The designed system is based on the state-of-the-art
   reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning (DL) framework, which
   consists of an input, modeling, and decision layer. To achieve better
   prediction accuracy with higher autonomy, a novel active robot-enabled
   inspection/maintenance system is deployed in the input layer to collect
   whole-field infrastructure sensing data and inspect critical CSSs. The
   deep RL approach is integrated with failure diagnostic and prognostic
   algorithms to train a risk-informed AI-based agent for controlling the
   robots. With the data collected from the input layer, the modeling layer
   first conducts data fusion and predicts RUL of components using an
   efficient Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) algorithm. In the
   decision layer, a resilience-driven probabilistic decision-making
   framework will be developed to control the robot for automatically
   detecting local damage, e.g. defects, degradation, and recommend
   mitigation/recovery actions for the health management of infrastructure
   under uncertainty. The combined layers comprise a AI-risk-driven sensing
   system (AIRSS) which was tested on an Aero-Propulsion System turbofan
   engine.

AB CHRONIOUS system is an integrated platform aiming at the management of
   chronic disease patients. One of the most important components of the
   system is a Decision Support System (DSS) that has been developed in a
   Smart Device (SD). This component decides on patient's current health
   status by combining several data, which are acquired either by wearable
   sensors or manually inputted by the patient or retrieved from the
   specific database. In case no abnormal situation has been tracked, the
   DSS takes no action and remains deactivated until next abnormal
   situation pack of data are being acquired or next scheduled data being
   transmitted. The DSS that has been implemented is an integrated
   classification system with two parallel classifiers, combining an expert
   system (rule-based system) and a supervised classifier, such as Support
   Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, artificial Neural Networks (aNN
   like the Multi-Layer Perceptron), Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. The
   above categorized system is useful for providing critical information
   about the health status of the patient.

AB The integration of advanced Variable-Rate Spraying (VRS) technologies
   with Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) represents a big step toward
   Precision Agriculture (PA). This combination improves efficiency and
   promotes sustainability in modern farming practices. The review examines
   the latest advancements and applications of VRS in autonomous
   agricultural systems and offers insights into how these technologies are
   reshaping the agricultural landscape. PA utilizes tools such as Global
   Positioning Systems (GPS), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and
   machine vision to apply agrochemicals, thereby optimizing pest control,
   fertilization, and more accurate crop management overall. However, while
   VRS holds excellent promise, important challenges remain, particularly
   in the areas of sensor data integration, real-time decision-making, and
   the coordination of vehicle movement with the spraying operation. This
   review explores the foundational principles of VRS, the role of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing these systems, and their
   transformative impact on modern farming practice. Through detailed case
   studies, this review shows that significant improvements in resource
   efficiency and environmental sustainability can be achieved through VRS.
   It also emphasizes the potential of integrating VRS with autonomous
   vehicles to revolutionize agriculture by analyzing current
   implementations and exploring future research directions. The paper
   presents a comprehensive management approach that can improve economic
   viability and promote ecological responsibility, paving the way for a
   more sustainable future in farming.

AB Intelligent mining technology, as the core driving force for the digital
   transformation of the mining industry, integrates cyber-physical
   systems, artificial intelligence, and industrial internet technologies
   to establish a "cloud-edge-end" collaborative system. In this paper, the
   development trajectory of intelligent mining technology has been
   systematically reviewed, which has gone through four stages: stand-alone
   automation, integrated automation and informatization, digital and
   intelligent initial, and comprehensive intelligence. And the current
   development status of "cloud-edge-end" technologies has been reviewed:
   (i) The end layer achieves environmental state monitoring and precise
   control through a multi-source sensing network and intelligent
   equipment. (ii) The edge layer leverages 5G and edge computing to
   accomplish real-time data processing, 3D dynamic modeling, and safety
   early warning. (iii) The cloud layer realizes digital planning and
   intelligent decision-making, based on the industrial Internet platform.
   The three-layer collaboration forms a
   "perception-analysis-decision-execution" closed loop. Currently, there
   are still many challenges in the development of the technology,
   including the lack of a standardization system, the bottleneck of
   multi-source heterogeneous data fusion, the lack of a cross-process
   coordination of the equipment, and the shortage of interdisciplinary
   talents. Accordingly, this paper focuses on future development trends
   from four aspects, providing systematic solutions for a safe, efficient,
   and sustainable mining operation. Technological evolution will
   accelerate the formation of an intelligent ecosystem characterized by
   "standard-driven, data-empowered, equipment-autonomous, and
   human-machine collaboration".

AB Early warning score (EWS) have become an essential component of patient
   safety strategies in healthcare environments worldwide. These systems
   aim to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration by evaluating
   vital signs and other physiological parameters, enabling timely
   intervention by rapid response teams. Despite proven benefits and
   widespread adoption, conventional EWS have limitations that may affect
   their ability to effectively detect and respond to patient
   deterioration. There is growing interest in integrating continuous
   multimodal monitoring technologies and advanced analytics, particularly
   artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based approaches,
   to address these limitations and enhance EWS performance. This review
   provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and potential
   future directions of AI-based bio-signal monitoring in early warning
   system. It examines emerging trends and techniques in AI and ML for
   bio-signal analysis, exploring the possibilities and potential
   applications of various bio-signals such as electroencephalography,
   electrocardiography, electromyography in early warning system. However,
   significant challenges exist in developing and implementing AI-based
   bio-signal monitoring systems in early warning system, including data
   acquisition strategies, data quality and standardization,
   interpretability and explainability, validation and regulatory approval,
   integration into clinical workflows, and ethical and legal
   considerations. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary
   approach involving close collaboration between healthcare professionals,
   data scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders. Future research
   should focus on developing advanced data fusion techniques, personalized
   adaptive models, real-time and continuous monitoring, explainable and
   reliable AI, and regulatory and ethical frameworks. By addressing these
   challenges and opportunities, the integration of AI and bio-signals into
   early warning systems can enhance patient monitoring and clinical
   decision support, ultimately improving healthcare quality and safety. In
   conclusion, integrating AI and bio-signals into the early warning system
   represents a promising approach to improve patient care outcomes and
   support clinical decision-making. As research in this field continues to
   evolve, it is crucial to develop safe, effective, and ethically
   responsible solutions that can be seamlessly integrated into clinical
   practice, harnessing the power of innovative technology to enhance
   patient care and improve individual and population health and
   well-being.

AB Denmark is one of the leading countries in establishing digital
   solutions in the health sector. When SARS-CoV-2 arrived in February
   2020, a real-time surveillance system could be rapidly built on existing
   infrastructure, This rapid data integration for COVID-19 surveillance
   enabled a data-driven response. Here we describe (a) the setup of the
   automated, real-time surveillance and vaccination monitoring system for
   COVID-19 in Denmark, including primary stakeholders, data sources, and
   algorithms, (b) describe outputs for various stakeholders, (c) how
   outputs were used for action and (d) reflect on challenges and lessons
   learnt. Outputs were tailored to four main stakeholder groups: four
   outputs provided direct information to individual citizens, four to
   complementary systems and researchers, 25 to decision-makers, and 15
   informed the public, aiding transparency. Core elements in
   infrastructure needed for automated surveillance had been in place for
   more than a decade. The COVID-19 epidemic was a pressure test that
   allowed us to explore the system's potential and identify challenges for
   future pandemic preparedness. The system described here constitutes a
   model for the future infectious disease surveillance in Denmark. With
   the current pandemic threat posed by avian influenza viruses, lessons
   learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic remain topical and relevant.

AB The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has resulted in notable
   environmental benefits, yet challenges persist regarding battery
   disposal and recovery. The increasing demand for EVs heightens concerns
   about the environmental impact of lithium-ion battery (LIB) waste, which
   threatens both ecosystems and public health. Although remanufacturing is
   seen as a sustainable solution to these issues, current research does
   not thoroughly examine the role of Industry 5.0 technologies in
   optimising this process. This study aims to compare and assess the
   potential of various Industry 5.0 technologies and approaches to enhance
   the remanufacturing of lithium-ion batteries. Using the AHP-PROMETHEE
   method, we identify the most critical and influential Industry 5.0
   prospects that should be prioritised for addressing key challenges such
   as diagnostic accuracy, safe disassembly, and high-quality reassembly.
   The multi-criteria analysis highlights key Industry 5.0 imperatives that
   can facilitate efficient and effective remanufacturing processes. The
   study identifies Digital Product Passport (DPP), Digital Twin (DT), and
   the Internet of Everything (IoE) as critical enablers in optimizing the
   LIB remanufacturing process. The analysis reveals that DPP stands out as
   the top enabler, significantly enhancing transparency, traceability, and
   lifecycle management for LIBs. DT and IoE follow closely, contributing
   to real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and seamless data
   integration across the supply chain. This paper delves in the emerging
   concept of the Digital Battery Passport (DBP), a DPP mandated by recent
   European regulations aimed at improving battery management and
   circularity. The DBP facilitates access to critical data throughout the
   battery's lifecycle, including its origin, composition, and state of
   health. This information is crucial for optimising remanufacturing
   processes, ensuring compliance with sustainability standards, and
   extending battery life. The paper highlights the potential of DBP to
   transform the EV battery value chain by enhancing transparency and
   enabling more informed decision-making across stakeholders. Our findings
   offer significant insights for policymakers, battery manufacturers, and
   remanufacturing firms.

AB The deep integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of
   Things (IoT) technologies has promoted the application of Artificial
   Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart agriculture, driving substantial
   transformations in agricultural data management systems and facilitating
   sustainable agricultural development. This paper reviews the key AIoT
   data management technologies employed in smart agriculture,
   systematically exploring the technical applications and practical
   implementations across four architectural layers. These layers (i.e.,
   perception layer, transport layer, data platform layer, and application
   layer) correspond to agricultural information sensing, data
   transmission, storage processing, and intelligent decision-making,
   respectively. Research indicates that, through the deployment of diverse
   sensing devices, low-latency short-range communications, wide-area
   wireless networks, cloud-edge collaborative computing, blockchain-based
   data storage, and AI-driven agricultural decision support systems, the
   data management framework of smart agriculture is undergoing continuous
   and intelligent enhancement. AIoT exhibits significant potential in
   enhancing agricultural productivity, optimizing resource allocation, and
   improving environmental adaptability. However, significant challenges
   remain, particularly in protecting agricultural data privacy and
   achieving real-time interoperability across heterogeneous platforms. The
   paper concludes by outlining future research directions, offering
   valuable insights for researchers in the field of smart agriculture.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) represent an integration of computational
   and physical elements, revolutionizing industries by enabling real-time
   monitoring, control, and optimization. A complementary technology,
   Digital Twin (DT), acts as a virtual replica of physical assets or
   processes, facilitating better decision making through simulations and
   predictive analytics. CPS and DT underpin the evolution of Industry 4.0
   by bridging the physical and digital domains. This survey explores their
   synergy, highlighting how DT enriches CPS with dynamic modeling,
   realtime data integration, and advanced simulation capabilities. The
   layered architecture of DTs within CPS is examined, showcasing the
   enabling technologies and tools vital for seamless integration. The
   study addresses key challenges in CPS modeling, such as concurrency and
   communication, and underscores the importance of DT in overcoming these
   obstacles. Applications in various sectors are analyzed, including smart
   manufacturing, healthcare, and urban planning, emphasizing the
   transformative potential of CPS-DT integration. In addition, the review
   identifies gaps in existing methodologies and proposes future research
   directions to develop comprehensive, scalable, and secure CPS-DT
   systems. By synthesizing insights from the current literature and
   presenting a taxonomy of CPS and DT, this survey serves as a
   foundational reference for academics and practitioners. The findings
   stress the need for unified frameworks that align CPS and DT with
   emerging technologies, fostering innovation and efficiency in the
   digital transformation era.

AB This study presents a novel digital twin-based predictive modeling
   approach to enhance the operation, maintenance, and management of
   combined cycle power plants. The research aimed to accurately forecast
   the combined cycle power (CCP) output, a critical performance indicator,
   to support intelligent decision-making for plant operators and
   engineers. The proposed framework leverages a neural ordinary
   differential equation (NODE) model integrated within a digital twin
   architecture to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of combined
   cycle gas turbine unit (CCGU) system. The predictive model was trained
   and validated using multivariate time-series data collected from a CCGU,
   achieving high accuracy with an R2_score of 0.993, a mean absolute
   percentage error of 0.325 %, and a root mean squared error of 1.518.
   Importantly, the NODE model demonstrated superior forecasting
   capabilities compared to traditional machine learning techniques. The
   digital twin (DT) concept enables seamless real-time data integration,
   physics-based models, and advanced data analytics to facilitate
   comprehensive CCGU lifecycle management. This novel approach provides
   operators with reliable, real-time insights to optimize plant
   performance, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall
   sustainability. The generalization of the NODE model to an independent
   CCGU unit validated its applicability across diverse power plant
   configurations, highlighting the originality and practical value of the
   research. The key contribution of this work is the development of a
   digital twin-based predictive modeling framework centered on the
   innovative use of neural ordinary differential equations to enhance the
   operation and maintenance of critical energy infrastructure. This
   research advances the state-of-the-art in intelligent asset management
   for the built environment.

AB The cyber-physical data of equipment whole life cycle are interrelated
   and play an important role in decision-making for business activities.
   However, multi-stage cyber-physical data are numerous, heterogeneous,
   and massive; non-real-time information data and real-time physical data
   are challenging to correspond to each other because of the inconsistency
   in space-time and granularity . As a result, equipment multi-stage
   heterogeneous cyber-physical data are difficult to effectively integrate
   and apply. Therefore, multi-stage cyber-physical data fusion of
   equipment is a key problem to be solved in manufacturing. To the best of
   our knowledge, a practicable framework and method to effectively fuse
   and apply equipment multi-stage data are still missing. To overcome this
   gap, this study proposes a multidimensional and multilevel
   cyber-physical fusion method for equipment. First, a four-dimensional
   cyber-physical fusion framework based on time, data, model, and
   structure is put forward. Then, the four kinds of fusion, including data
   fusion, model fusion, knowledge fusion, and digital twin (DT)
   application fusion, are discussed detailedly. Besides, the five types of
   algorithms set to support the fusion process are given. Finally,
   equipment life cycle activity is regarded as a DT application process
   using dynamic association of data and models. Through cyber-physical
   fusion, the data of equipment multi- stages could be applied for
   different activities to solve problems by means of DT. As a primary
   verification of the feasibility of the proposed approach, a case study
   of metro vehicle performance evaluation has been carried out, and the
   results have well confirmed that the multi-stage cyber-physical fusion
   method is feasible.

AB With the advent of smart manufacturing, companies are adapting their
   business processes and procedures to match concepts and requirements
   related to this industrial revolution. In this scenario, maintenance
   sector should evolve to keep pace with new technological trends by
   shifting from traditional approaches to a smart paradigm. Some
   consolidated methodologies rely on standard evaluation, like Risk
   Priority Number, to plan maintenance actions on machines and components.
   However, contemporary and smart approaches should be characterized by
   data-driven (quantitative knowledge) as well as operator's experience
   (qualitative knowledge) in order to provide a whole understanding and
   visibility of the system health status. In this context and with a view
   of digital twin concepts (under the Industry 4.0 technology), a decision
   support methodology (or framework) plays an essential role by providing
   knowledge and assisting operators in the decision-making process. With
   this concept in mind, this paper focuses on integrating several and not
   alike fields of study (process mining, multicriteria decision-making
   (MCDM), and data fusion) to enable the assessment of a risk and
   criticality analysis to rank industrial machines in order to carry
   out/plan maintenance tasks on them. Therefore, merging those fields of
   study aims at accomplishing a dynamic, flexible, and real-time
   evaluation to perform a robust, accurate, and responsive analysis of the
   system. The results from different analysis scenarios show the influence
   of maintenance indicators on the machine ranking process, highlighting
   the feasibility and flexibility of the approach, as well as expanding
   the application in modern systems by optimizing quality of maintenance
   decisions.

AB Meeting food safety requirements without jeopardizing quality attributes
   or sustainability involves adopting a holistic perspective of food
   products, their manufacturing processes and their storage and
   distribution practices. The virtualization of the food supply chain
   offers opportunities to evaluate, simulate, and predict challenges and
   mishaps potentially contributing to present and future food safety
   risks. Food systems virtualization poses several requirements: (1) a
   comprehensive framework composed of instrumental, digital, and
   computational methods to evaluate internal and external factors that
   impact food safety; (2) nondestructive and real-time sensing methods,
   such as spectroscopic-based techniques, to facilitate mapping and
   tracking food safety and quality indicators; (3) a dynamic platform
   supported by the Internet of Things (IoT) interconnectivity to integrate
   information, perform online data analysis and exchange information on
   product history, outbreaks, exposure to risky situations, etc.; and (4)
   comprehensive and complementary mathematical modeling techniques
   (including but not limited to chemical reactions and microbial
   inactivation and growth kinetics) based on extensive data sets to make
   realistic simulations and predictions possible. Despite current
   limitations in data integration and technical skills for virtualization
   to reach its full potential, its increasing adoption as an interactive
   and dynamic tool for food systems evaluation can improve resource
   utilization and rational design of products, processes and logistics for
   enhanced food safety. Virtualization offers affordable and reliable
   options to assist stakeholders in decision-making and personnel
   training. This chapter focuses on definitions and requirements for
   developing and applying virtual food systems, including digital twins,
   and their role and future trends in enhancing food safety.

AB Real-time simulation and digital twin (DT) as a part of Industry 4.0 are
   becoming increasingly relevant, especially when considering production
   cycles. Most issues with production cycles arise from having a demand
   for customized production orders, while having nonmodular production
   lines with a medium-to-high complexity in the decision-making process.
   All these conditions lead to a possibility of unpredictable
   consequences. Being able to predict behavior and possible failure
   scenarios before the production starts has proven to save both costs and
   time. With an introduction of a new ISO standard which is solely focused
   on DT creation and sets a starting point for future research,
   researchers are finally able to focus on creating DT prototypes built
   for specific scenarios while maintaining the core concepts. This paper
   focuses on proposing strategies for DT and real-time simulation
   integration into production cycles, based on the new standards, which
   can be generalized and applied on a multitude of different systems with
   minimal changes. The proposed solutions offer different levels of human
   interaction with the Human-Machine Interfaces used in Cyber-Physical
   Systems created as a part of DT. Applicability of the solution has been
   verified based on the results of experiments carried out on the WITNESS
   Horizon simulation platform with utilization of the custom Order

AB Crop nitrogen (N) demand is defined by various physiological, management
   and environmental factors that interact with each other and involve
   temporal and spatial dynamics. Variable rate N application (VRNA)
   intends to address this but the underlying algorithms often remain
   rather rigid and deterministic, are partly subject to high uncertainties
   and largely leave the agronomic expert's knowledge and experience
   unnoticed. A novel generic system architecture was conceptualized to
   overcome these limitations and respond to the complexity of N management
   in a straightforward and both, reactive and proactive manner. Having a
   fuzzy expert system as methodical core, the approach mainly relies on
   human input to grasp the circumstances at a specific N appli-cation and
   address the required parameter interactions. As a holistic concept, it
   further aims at a high versatility in terms of considered input data and
   utilization with different sensor and application technology, as well as
   a digitized VRNA process chain involving graphical user interfaces to
   simplify procedures for data presentation, decision making, application
   and documentation. Bringing the presented concept into a prototypic
   imple-mentation considering real-time crop N sensor and mapped soil
   data, its consistency was verified. At the same time, potential
   functionalities, as well as limitations were illustrated and technical
   requirements on specific subsystems were clarified by the prototype. The
   possible risks that stand in the way of high benefits due to a strong
   focus on expert knowledge can be countered by using digital tools and
   heading towards hybridization with other VRNA approaches.

   issuing alarms with respect to different town areas. Experimental data
   gathering in the Rome urban area and subsequent processing results are

AB Aircraft dispatch involves determining the optimal dispatch option when
   an aircraft experiences an unexpected failure. Currently, maintenance
   technicians at the apron have limited access to support information and
   finding the right information in extensive maintenance manuals is a
   time-consuming task, often leading to technically induced delays. This
   paper introduces a novel web-based prototype decision support system to
   aid technicians during aircraft dispatch decision-making and subsequent
   maintenance execution. A system architecture for real-time dispatch
   decision support is established and implemented. The developed system is
   evaluated through a case study in an operational environment by licensed
   maintenance technicians. The system fully automates information
   retrieval from multiple data sources, performs alternative
   identification and evaluation for a given fault message, and provides
   the technician with on-site access to relevant information, including
   the related maintenance tasks. The case study indicates a potential time
   saving of up to 98% per dispatch decision. Moreover, it enables
   digitalization of the-currently mostly paper-based-dispatch decision
   process, thereby reducing logistics and paper waste. The prototype is
   the first to provide operational decision support in the aircraft
   maintenance domain and addresses the lack of correlation between theory
   and practice often found in decision support systems research by
   providing a representative case study. The developed custom parser for
   SGML-based documents enables efficient identification and extraction of
   relevant information, vastly contributing to the overall reduction of
   the decision time.

AB Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for solving stochastic
   optimization problems. The aerospace and defense sectors have a number
   of stochastic optimization problems that would benefit from the
   application of ML; however, people often have difficulties interpreting
   solutions arrived at via ML, which undermines trust, producing an
   obstacle to widespread adoption in these sectors. This paper introduces
   the Self-Explaining Decision Architecture (SEDA) for ML-based
   decision-making systems capable of generating intuitive explanations for
   their decisions in real time. SEDA makes use of a feature extraction
   subsystem and a sequence interpretation subsystem to identify patterns
   in data followed by a decision generation subsystem that determines
   appropriate actions based on those patterns. Internal state information
   from each of these subsystems is used to generate explanations of the
   system's decisions. Using this information to create explanations
   provides insight as to the data elements the system focused on when
   making decisions as well as the reasoning that was used. As a
   proof-of-concept, we present a first implementation of SEDA using
   start-of-the-art deep learning components including a combined
   convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network with
   attention mechanisms and demonstrate its use on both standard and custom
   datasets.

AB We present ideas aimed at bringing revolutionary changes on
   architectures and buildings of tomorrow by radically advancing the
   technology for the building material concrete and hence building
   components. We propose that by using nanotechnology we could embed
   computation and sensing directly into the material used for
   construction. Intelligent concrete blocks and panels advanced with
   stimuli-responsive smart paints are the core of the proposed
   architecture. In particular, the photo-responsive paint would sense the
   buildings internal and external environment while the
   nano-material-concrete composite material would be capable of sensing
   the building environment and implement massive-parallel information
   processing resulting in distributed decision making. A calibration of
   the proposed materials with in-materio suitable computational methods
   and corresponding building information modelling, computer-aided design
   and digital manufacturing tools could be achievedvia models and
   prototypes of information processing at nano-level. The emergent
   technology sees a building as high-level massive-parallel
   computer-assembled of computing concrete blocks. Based on the generic
   principles of neuromorphic computation and reservoir computing we
   envisage a single building or an urban quarter to turn into a
   large-scale sensing substrate. It could behave as a universal computer,
   collecting and processing environmental information in situ enabling
   appropriate data fusion. The broad range of spatio-temporal effects
   include infrastructural and human mobility, energy, bio-diversity,
   digital activity, urban management, art and socializing, robustness with
   regard to damage and noise or real-time monitoring of environmental
   changes. The proposed intelligent architectures will increase
   sustainability and viability in digitised urban environments by
   decreasing information transfer bandwidth by e.g, utilising 5G networks.
   The emergence of socio-cultural effect will create a cybernetic
   relationship with our dwellings and cities.

   objects and a data fusion model to support industrial management
   decision making applied to a clothes manufacturing enterprise. The
   management processes cover factory-production levels to higher
   decision-making levels. Therefore, the proposed KBS contributes to
   solving different kind of decision problems, including factory
   supervision, production planning and control, productivity management,
   real-time monitoring, and data acquisition and processing. The web
   access via different middleware devices and tools at different process
   levels, along with the use of integrated algorithms, decision methods,
   and smart objects, promote an optimized use of knowledge and resources.
   In this paper the proposed KBS is introduced and an example of its use
   is illustrated with an example of a clothes manufacturing resources
   selection, using the embedded dynamic multi-criteria fusion model.

AB Within the framework development program of the SeaOtter MK2 Autonomous
   Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), in 2013, ATLAS ELEKTRONIK GmbH designed a
   combined multi sensor system capable of deep sea operations also known
   as DDAUV (Deep Diving AUV). The DDAUV is equipped with mid-and
   high-frequency sonar systems, magnetometers and optical based sensors
   (image and video). The purpose of the DDAUV is to perform independent
   detection, localization, tracking and categorization of specified
   objects of interest (OOI) that are lying on the seafloor or buried
   within the upper sediment layer [1]. In this paper we present the
   detection improvements achieved by fusing information from the following
   DDAUV sensors: video camera; side scan sonar (SSS); multi beam
   echo-sounder (MBES); and buried object scanning sonar (BOSS). The last
   is capable for both: time delay beamforming (the result of this
   beamforming is referred to as Voxel Layer VL) and synthetic aperture
   sonar (SAS) processing (referred to as tomographic imaging). In the OOI
   detection, automatic real-time processing combined with high-resolution
   data enables an immediate detection, localization and categorization to
   take place; thus allowing for autonomous decision-making based on the
   up-todate measurements and observations. Results from sea trials are
   also demonstrated.

AB This paper will present the project RAPIDMAP. The project is part of
   CONCERT-Japan, an ERA-NET initiative funded through the FP7 INCO project
   frame for enhancing research cooperation between European countries and
   Japan on two topics, one of which is Resilience Against Disasters. The
   project started in June 2013 and has a duration of 2 years. In the
   paper, we will outline the aims of the project, methodologies and
   techniques to be developed and some test data.
   Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) are powerful
   technologies for collecting useful information on the damages of
   disasters in short time. However, since many different types of RS data
   are available (satellite, aerial, UAV, terrestrial), data
   co-registration, information integration and feature extraction need
   reliable and advanced methodologies. In the RAPIDMAP project, we will
   develop practical ways to integrate RS data processing tools in
   near-real-time and allow users to use this data soon after the disasters
   by means of WebGIS tools. This will help not only decision makers but
   also end-users in the disaster area. The key components of this project
   are:
   (1) Near-real-time monitoring: the procedure of near-real-time
   monitoring with satellites as well as Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAV)
   will be set up and demonstrated.
   (2) Data co-registration: in disasters, various images as well as maps
   come from different sources. The co-registration of multiple images is a
   key technology for information integration. In this project, a system to
   co-register multiple images in near-real-time will be developed.
   (3) Data fusion and change detection: one of the advantages of RS is to
   collect information with multiple sensors. Various methods for fusing
   optical with active microwave (SAR) sensor data for information
   extraction and change detection will be developed.
   (4) Decision Support System (DSS) based on WebGIS technologies: the
   collected and integrated information has to be easily accessible and
   visible by decision makers and end-users in near-real-time and
   worldwide. By using WebGIS technologies, wireless networks and portable
   terminals, a DSS will allow easy access, retrieval and visualization of
   all information (fused data, images, maps, etc.) in very short time
   after data collection and processing.
   The project will be practically tested and demonstrated at the Tohoku
   area in Japan and another test site, which were recently affected by
   large disasters.

AB In a critical infrastructure disaster incident, emergency managers are
   often compelled to make time-critical decisions based on incomplete
   information streaming in at disparate times from multiple data sources.
   As the incident progresses, the ability to predict where additional
   resources will be needed is crucial to both response and recovery.
   Decision making and prediction in this context requires combining (
   fusing) incoming data streams; presenting relevant information from
   these streams in a form appropriate for each user; and using data from
   similar historical events to predict resource needs and incident
   evolution. This paper discusses the role of data fusion, data
   integration, and data mining in decision making for municipal or
   regional emergency managers. It also explores the implementation of
   web-based decision support tools. Finally, the paper makes
   recommendations for improving information management and streamlining
   decision support.

AB Geography is shifting from static description to a feedback-driven,
   adaptive discipline integrating sensing, prediction, comparison, and
   continuous self-improvement. This transformation underlies Intelligent
   Geography (IG), where artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics,
   and high-performance computing (HPC) converge to enhance spatial
   understanding and guide intelligent decisions in complex systems. The
   discipline's historical stages-descriptive, experimental, theoretical,
   quantitative, GIScience, and information geography-form the foundation
   for an overarching adaptive framework. In this framework, diverse
   geospatial data streams seamlessly feed real-time models whose predicted
   outputs are compared with observed conditions to iteratively refine
   predictions. A hallmark of IG is embedding domain theory into AI
   workflows, producing predictive models that self-adjust to new data or
   control system behavior. Applications such as smart traffic management,
   climate-responsive urban planning, and disaster-resilient digital twins
   illustrate the sensing-prediction-adaptation/learning cycle in practice
   for complex changing systems. We examine the enabling roles of HPC, deep
   learning, and geographic large models in implementing feedback loops,
   and address persistent challenges in data integration, interpretability,
   and governance. We conclude with a vision of IG as an evolving
   socio-technical ecosystem that through adaptation and self-learning
   turns spatial data into adaptive, actionable knowledge that assists in
   intelligent decision-making, whether it is for AI systems or human ones.

AB We propose a dynamic monitoring and precision fertilization decision
   system for agricultural soil nutrients, integrating UAV remote sensing
   and GIS technologies to address the limitations of traditional soil
   nutrient assessment methods. The proposed method combines multi-source
   data fusion, including hyperspectral and multispectral UAV imagery with
   ground sensor data, to achieve high-resolution spatial and spectral
   analysis of soil nutrients. Real-time data processing algorithms enable
   rapid updates of soil nutrient status, while a time-series dynamic model
   captures seasonal variations and crop growth stage influences, improving
   prediction accuracy (RMSE reductions of 43-70% for nitrogen, phosphorus,
   and potassium compared to conventional laboratory-based methods and
   satellite NDVI approaches). The experimental validation compared the
   proposed system against two conventional approaches: (1) laboratory soil
   testing with standardized fertilization recommendations and (2)
   satellite NDVI-based fertilization. Field trials across three distinct
   agroecological zones demonstrated that the proposed system reduced
   fertilizer inputs by 18-27% while increasing crop yields by 4-11%,
   outperforming both conventional methods. Furthermore, an intelligent
   fertilization decision model generates tailored fertilization plans by
   analyzing real-time soil conditions, crop demands, and climate factors,
   with continuous learning enhancing its precision over time. The system
   also incorporates GIS-based visualization tools, providing intuitive
   spatial representations of nutrient distributions and interactive
   functionalities for detailed insights. Our approach significantly
   advances precision agriculture by automating the entire workflow from
   data collection to decision-making, reducing resource waste and
   optimizing crop yields. The integration of UAV remote sensing, dynamic
   modeling, and machine learning distinguishes this work from conventional
   static systems, offering a scalable and adaptive framework for
   sustainable farming practices.

AB The progressive degradation of bridge infrastructure poses significant
   risks to transportation safety, necessitating advanced monitoring and
   management strategies. Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as a
   transformative technology for real-time structural monitoring, offering
   a dynamic and data-driven representation of physical assets. When
   combined with Deep Learning (DL), DTs enhance predictive capabilities by
   leveraging vast amounts of sensor data to detect structural anomalies,
   optimize maintenance strategies, and improve decision-making processes.
   This synergy enables a more accurate, automated, and cost-effective
   approach to infrastructure health monitoring, ensuring timely
   interventions and prolonged service life. This paper presents a novel
   data-driven DT framework for real-time bridge damage detection,
   incorporating two key innovations. First, a Multi-Domain Fusion
   Autoencoder (MDFA) that integrates raw acceleration data with feature
   fusion from time, frequency, and wavelet domains. Second, a synthetic
   anomaly simulation approach for evaluation. The framework employs a
   transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate
   realistic synthetic signals, which are modified to simulate various
   damage scenarios. Evaluations on Australia's Werrington Bridge
   demonstrate the MDFA's ability to detect subtle anomalies often
   overlooked by conventional unsupervised DL methods. A comparative
   analysis confirms its superior detection capabilities. Further
   validation on Austria's S101 Bridge using real damage data successfully
   identifies and localizes all damage scenarios without requiring
   additional optimization. These results highlight the efficiency of
   feature fusion techniques in improving anomaly detection accuracy and
   suggest that synthetic anomaly simulation offers a cost-effective
   alternative to laboratory testing for evaluating unsupervised damage
   detection approaches.

AB With the rapid advancement of global urbanization, cities are facing
   challenges such as aging infrastructure, environmental pollution, and
   resource waste. Traditional urban renewal methods are characterized by
   long cycles, high costs, and low efficiency, making them ill-suited to
   meet the complex governance needs of modern cities. As an emerging
   digital tool, Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a novel
   solution for urban renewal through real-time data collection and
   analysis. This paper explores the potential applications of IoT
   technology throughout the entire lifecycle of urban renewal projects,
   analyzing. It analyzes IoT's effectiveness in investment
   decision-making, risk assessment, urban planning, smart building design,
   and construction management, while also addressing the challenges it
   faces. In investment decision-making, IoT offers data on infrastructure
   health monitoring and resource usage, aiding in risk and feasibility
   assessments. During the planning phase, real-time data optimize urban
   function layouts, enhancing planning accuracy. In the design,
   construction, and operation phases, IoT improves building energy
   efficiency and construction management, ensuring quality and safety.
   However, the implementation of IoT technology also faces challenges,
   including technological integration and standardization, data security
   and privacy protection, investment cost control, and multi-modal data
   fusion. To address these challenges, it is essential to establish
   unified industry standards, promote data security and privacy policies,
   and conduct comprehensive cost-benefit analyses to ensure the
   sustainability of urban renewal projects. In the future, with the
   continuous advancement of AI, big data, and 5 G technologies, IoT will
   play an increasingly vital role in driving smart cities, sustainable
   development, and green construction.

AB Effective construction schedule planning is essential for project
   success. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a methodology with high
   potential to enhance planning processes and benefit construction
   management. Although extensive research has examined BIM's application
   in schedule planning from various perspectives, a knowledge gap exists
   in studies that synthesize and analyze the knowledge structure in this
   area. Therefore, this study addresses this gap through a bibliometric
   analysis of 489 journal articles published from 2008 to 2024, utilizing
   performance metrics, science mapping, and trend analysis techniques.
   Based on centrality and density metrics, the science mapping reveals
   five key areas of the knowledge structure of BIM adoption in
   construction scheduling: BIM construction scheduling, advanced
   construction monitoring and data integration, supply chain management in
   sustainable and safe construction, project management and productivity,
   and earthworks and intelligent construction. Furthermore, trend analysis
   shows that the integration of BIM with artificial intelligence has been
   increasing due to its potential to optimize and improve construction
   planning. BIM enables enhanced project control and monitoring by
   integrating real-time data updates and visual simulations, supporting
   proactive decision-making during construction execution. The findings
   provide an overview of the knowledge field for professionals and
   researchers, offering information into the current state of BIM adoption
   in construction scheduling. It highlights current research trends and
   identifies gaps, suggesting directions for future studies to advance the
   field.

AB Accurately predicting the bucket fill rate of excavators is a
   challenging task due to factors such as material flowability and the
   complex coupling interactions between the material and the bucket. To
   address this challenge, this paper proposes a bucket fill rate
   prediction method based on multi-sensor data fusion and deep learning.
   The ITCBAM model was developed by integrating a Convolutional Block
   Attention Module (CBAM) into the InceptionTime framework, leveraging
   multi-source sensor data such as cylinder displacement and stereo vision
   to enable precise predictions of fill rates. Results show that the
   ITCBAM model achieves prediction errors of 9.48% and 10.65% on the
   familiar and unfamiliar test sets, respectively. Compared to physical
   models and other deep learning models, it demonstrates higher prediction
   accuracy and stronger generalization capability. This method facilitates
   excavation decision-making, enhances construction efficiency, and
   provides valuable insights for further research on the automation and
   real-time prediction of construction machinery.

AB Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, causing
   significant loss of life, property damage, and disruption to
   communities. The necessity for creative and practical flood monitoring
   and prevention technologies has been highlighted in recent years by the
   frequency and intensity of floods that are growing. Flood management
   uses cutting-edge technology and approaches, as well as, their potential
   to increase disaster resilience. This study reviews flood monitoring and
   prevention strategies from a data analytic perspective, particularly
   those involving the Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning. The
   utilization of IoT, data analytics, and machine learning tools within
   cutting-edge solutions facilitates real-time data collection, predictive
   modeling, and informed decision-making. With the help of community
   involvement and potential catastrophe, resilience improved and
   safeguarded the people, and property damages in flood-prone areas.
   Techniques for flood monitoring are explored including remote sensing,
   IoT, ground-based solutions, machine learning, and early flood alert
   systems concerning their processes involving data acquisition, data
   integration, scalability, real-time monitoring, infrastructure, and
   accuracy. In addition, current challenges are these approaches are
   discussed and future research directions are outlined. Key findings
   indicate the integration of these technologies to enhance disaster
   resilience by providing real-time monitoring and early warning systems,
   hence drastically reducing the impact caused by floods. This paper
   presents flood monitoring techniques through remote sensing, IoT,
   ground-based solutions, machine learning, and early flood alert systems
   in such aspects as data acquisition, integration, scalability, real-time
   monitoring, infrastructure, and accuracy. These techniques, however, are
   all still bedeviled by challenges such as high implementation costs,
   maintenance difficulties, and the feature of a robust communication
   infrastructure. In this regard, research in the future will be directed
   to cost-effectiveness in solution designing, improving the accuracy of
   predictive models, and wider engagement involving the community in flood
   risk management.

AB Large-scale hydro-steel structures (LS-HSSs) are vital to hydraulic
   engineering, supporting critical functions such as water resource
   management, flood control, power generation, and navigation. However,
   due to prolonged exposure to severe environmental conditions and complex
   operational loads, these structures progressively degrade, posing
   increased risks over time. The absence of effective structural health
   monitoring (SHM) systems exacerbates these risks, as undetected damage
   and wear can compromise safety. This paper presents an advanced SHM
   framework designed to enhance the real-time monitoring and safety
   evaluation of LS-HSSs. The framework integrates the finite element
   method (FEM), multi-sensor data fusion, and Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies into a closed-loop system for real-time perception,
   analysis, decision-making, and optimization. The system was deployed and
   validated at the Luhun Reservoir spillway, where it demonstrated stable
   and reliable performance for real-time anomaly detection and
   decision-making. Monitoring results over time were consistent, with
   stress values remaining below allowable thresholds and meeting safety
   standards. Specifically, stress monitoring during radial gate operations
   (with a current water level of 1.4 m) indicated that the dynamic stress
   values induced by flow vibrations at various points increased by
   approximately 2 MPa, with no significant impact loads. Moreover, the
   vibration amplitude during gate operation was below 0.03 mm, confirming
   the absence of critical structural damage and deformation. These results
   underscore the SHM system's capacity to enhance operational safety and
   maintenance efficiency, highlighting its potential for broader
   application across water conservancy infrastructure.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is the recent technology intended to
   facilitate the daily life of humans by providing the power to connect,
   control and automate objects in the physical world. In this logic, the
   IoT helps to improve our way of producing and working in various areas
   (e.g. agriculture, industry, healthcare, transportation etc). Basically,
   an IoT network comprises physical devices, equipped with sensors and
   transmitters, that are interconnected with each other and/or connected
   to the Internet. Its main objective is to gather and transmit data to a
   storage system such as a server or cloud to enable processing and
   analysis, ultimately facilitating rapid decision-making or enhancements
   to the user experience. In the realm of Connected Objects, an effective
   IoT data collection system plays a vital role by providing several
   benefits, such as real-time data monitoring, enhanced decision-making,
   increased operational efficiency etc. However, because of the resource
   limitations linked to connected objects, such as low memory and battery,
   or even single-use devices etc. IoT data collecting presents several
   challenges including scalability, security, interoperability,
   flexibility etc. for both researchers and companies. The authors

AB The quick proliferation of pandemic diseases has been imposing many
   concerns on the international health infrastructure. To combat pandemic
   diseases in smart cities, Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
   technology, based on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI)
   with the Internet of Things (IoT), is commonly used to promote efficient
   control and diagnosis during the outbreak, thereby minimizing possible
   losses. However, the presence of multi-source institutional data remains
   one of the major challenges hindering the practical usage of AIoT
   solutions for pandemic disease diagnosis. This paper presents a novel
   framework that utilizes multi-site data fusion to boost the accurateness
   of pandemic disease diagnosis. In particular, we focus on a case study
   of COVID-19 lesion segmentation, a crucial task for understanding
   disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies. In this study,
   we propose a novel multi-decoder segmentation network for efficient
   segmentation of infections from cross-domain CT scans in smart cities.
   The multi-decoder segmentation network leverages data from heterogeneous
   domains and utilizes strong learning representations to accurately
   segment infections. Performance evaluation of the multi-decoder
   segmentation network was conducted on three publicly accessible
   datasets, demonstrating robust results with an average dice score of
   89.9% and an average surface dice of 86.87%. To address scalability and
   latency issues associated with centralized cloud systems, fog computing
   (FC) emerges as a viable solution. FC brings resources closer to the
   operator, offering low latency and energy-efficient data management and
   processing. In this context, we propose a unique FC technique called
   PANDFOG to deploy the multi-decoder segmentation network on edge nodes
   for practical and clinical applications of automated COVID-19 pneumonia
   analysis. The results of this study highlight the efficacy of the
   multi-decoder segmentation network in accurately segmenting infections
   from cross-domain CT scans. Moreover, the proposed PANDFOG system
   demonstrates the practical deployment of the multi-decoder segmentation
   network on edge nodes, providing real-time access to COVID-19
   segmentation findings for improved patient monitoring and clinical
   decision-making.

AB For prenatal screening, ultrasound (US) imaging allows for real-time
   observation of developing fetal anatomy. Understanding normal and
   aberrant forms through extensive fetal structural assessment enables for
   early detection and intervention. However, the reliability of anomaly
   diagnosis varies depending on operator expertise and device limits.
   First trimester scans in conjunction with circulating biochemical
   markers are critical in identifying high-risk pregnancies, but they also
   pose technical challenges. Recent engineering advancements in automated
   diagnosis, such as artificial intelligence (AI)-based US image
   processing and multimodal data fusion, are developing to improve
   screening efficiency, accuracy, and consistency. Still, creating trust
   in these data-driven solutions is necessary for integration and
   acceptability in clinical settings. Transparency can be promoted by
   explainable AI (XAI) technologies that provide visual interpretations
   and illustrate the underlying diagnostic decision making process. An
   explanatory framework based on deep learning is suggested to construct
   charts depicting anomaly screening results from US video feeds. AI
   modelling can then be applied to these charts to connect defects with
   probable deformations. Overall, engineering approaches that increase
   imaging, automation, and interpretability hold enormous promise for
   altering traditional workflows and expanding diagnostic capabilities for
   better prenatal care.

AB With the continuous promotion of digital transformation in the field of
   power transformation, the diversification of application scenarios, and
   the scale of pilot construction, the real-time, concurrency, and
   security requirements for data fusion and application support of the
   power monitoring system, management information system, and other
   business platforms are getting higher and higher, and this paper puts
   forward a high concurrency and availability "cloud-side-end
   collaboration" based on edge computing. This paper proposes a high
   concurrency and availability "cloud, edge and end collaboration"
   architecture based on edge computing for substation operation support
   systems. First, this paper summarizes the development status of domestic
   substation operation support systems and analyzes the advantages and
   disadvantages of various technical architectures. Then, a
   "cloud-side-end cooperative" substation operation support system
   architecture with "high real-time, high concurrency, high security and
   high stability" is proposed, which focuses on remote inspection, remote
   operation, and remote safety control of substation businesses from the
   perspective of engineering applications. It realizes transparent
   monitoring of equipment operation, unified management of operation data,
   and integration of production command and decision-making; solves the
   problems of dispersed coexistence of multiple systems for dispatching,
   monitoring, analysis, management, and other businesses, switching
   between multiple systems, and insufficient real-time and stability of
   the system; and controls the risks of the grid, reduces the potential
   safety hazards, and solves the contradiction between the continuous
   growth of the grid equipment and the shortage of production personnel.
   The results of engineering application examples show that the proposed
   architecture compared with the existing system architecture has greater

TI Development of a Real-Time Dashboard for Overdose Touchpoints:

AB Background: Overdose Fatality Review (OFR) is an important public health
   tool for shaping overdose prevention strategies in communities. However,
   OFR teams review only a few cases at a time, which typically represent a
   small fraction of the total fatalities in their jurisdiction. Such
   limited review could result in a partial understanding of local overdose
   patterns, leading to policy recommendations that do not fully address
   the broader community needs. Objective: This study explored the
   potential to enhance conventional OFRs with a data dashboard,
   incorporating visualizations of touchpoints-events that precede
   overdoses-to highlight prevention opportunities. Methods: We conducted 2
   focus groups and a survey of OFR experts to characterize their
   information needs and design a real-time dashboard that tracks and
   measures decedents' past interactions with services in Indiana. Experts
   (N=27) were engaged, yielding insights on essential data features to
   incorporate and providing feedback to guide the development of
   visualizations. Results: The findings highlighted the importance of
   showing decedents' interactions with health services (emergency medical
   services) and the justice system (incarcerations). Emphasis was also
   placed on maintaining decedent anonymity, particularly in small
   communities, and the need for training OFR members in data
   interpretation. The developed dashboard summarizes key touchpoint
   metrics, including prevalence, interaction frequency, and time intervals
   between touchpoints and overdoses, with data viewable at the county and
   state levels. In an initial evaluation, the dashboard was well received
   for its comprehensive data coverage and its potential for enhancing OFR
   recommendations and case selection. Conclusions: The Indiana touchpoints
   dashboard is the first to display real-time visualizations that link
   administrative and overdose mortality data across the state. This
   resource equips local health officials and OFRs with timely,
   quantitative, and spatiotemporal insights into overdose risk factors in
   their communities, facilitating data -driven interventions and policy
   changes. However, fully integrating the dashboard into OFR practices
   will likely require training teams in data interpretation and decision
   -making.

AB Due to the overwhelming characteristics of the IoT (Internet of Things),
   it has been used in different application areas to monitor various
   activities continuously. However, the development of a reliable decision
   support system (DSS) and communication approach are among the core
   issues associated with the traditional networking infrastructures in
   general and IoT in particular. Numerous communication mechanisms have
   been reported in the literature to address these issues in traditional
   and resource constraint networks. In this paper, a networking parametric
   ensemble-based wireless communication approach is presented to ensure
   reliable transmission of the packets from source to destination in the
   IoT networks. The proposed approach bounds every member device to
   collect valuable data from the neighboring devices, preferably those
   with minimum hop count value, to find the most optimal neighboring
   device and enforce an optimal path for onward communication in the IoT
   networks. Additionally, a reliable and efficient DSS is presented
   preferably for servers to refine the captured data before processing
   which enhances the accuracy. Simulation results have verified the
   exceptional performance of the proposed DSS on real-time and benchmark
   datasets in terms of various evaluation metrics in the IoT networks,
   with the accuracy of the proposed DSS being around 95%.

AB Geo-environmental information is an important basis for geohazard
   analysis and the integration of geo-environmental data is crucial in the
   construction of urban emergency management systems. In existing urban
   spatial information systems, the integration of geo-environmental data
   is neither intuitive nor efficient enough to support the analysis of
   geohazards well. On the basis of Web virtual globe, this paper proposes
   a comprehensive framework for the integration and analysis of
   geo-environmental data. This framework can effectively integrate
   geological data with a 3D geological model as a carrier, seamlessly
   connect geographic data, dynamically load real-time monitoring data, and
   build 3D visualisation and analysis scenes of urban full-space temporal
   information in the browser. The application example shows that the
   proposed framework can provide good geo-environmental data and practical
   data analysis functions for geohazard early warning and decision making,
   and improve the efficiency of government departments' response to
   geohazards.

AB The era of the Internet of Things and big data has completely changed
   the landscape of many scientific disciplines. Embracing the big data
   revolution, machine learning techniques seem to have substituted
   traditional physics-based models due to their effectiveness and
   flexibility. According to Rolls-Royce [1], the smart ship will
   revolutionize the landscape of ship design and operations, the same way
   smartphones did our daily life. These enhanced data-driven analytics
   yield substantial benefits in terms of cost savings by limiting the
   degree to which human factor intervenes to perform certain operations,
   and also by providing reliable and accurate information in real-time
   information regarding the operational health of the machinery on board,
   ensuring the safety of the crew as well as the reliability of the
   equipment. [2]. Despite its importance, the majority of efforts towards
   this direction are limited to academic efforts or black-box approaches.
   In the current work, a distributed software platform that augments the
   decision-making process within the shipping industry is critically
   presented. Key technological pillars are Big Data technologies, data
   fusion, and large-scale deep learning-based processing techniques.
   Evaluation of the platform, based on actual case data, provides evidence
   of its capacity for diagnosis and anomaly detection on the operation of
   critical subsystems.

   well-known databases of terrain imagery, elevation, and surveyed
   aviation locations. This visualization system allows teams of research
   engineers and managers to collaborate in real-time, during test flights,
   in a distributed fashion. Each user interacts with their own copy of the
   virtual world, updated constantly in real-time, to manipulate and
   investigate in a fashion that best accomplishes their own specific task.
   This allows the entire team to collaborate simultaneously, which
   mitigates the common latency associated with team members performing
   offline tasks, such as inspecting log files or verifying MatLab plots.
   Test flights utilizing our visualization system have shown that it
   enabled the research team to make decisions on the fly, such as changing
   the antenna type and placement, and also allowed post-flight analysis
   and prediction of desirable changes. It could, for instance, predict
   optimal antenna placement for a given flight path. This can save a
   project the large expense of performing additional test flights if
   analysis had been performed offline between flights. Since our system is
   GPS based, it can be used as an alternate truth system to validate
   traditional instrument approach and landing systems. The recording and
   playback features of our visualization can also be used as a teaching
   aid in flight training for both pilots and air traffic controllers.

AB Background: With the rapid development and increasing complexity of the
   modern food industry and food supply chain, consumers are placing
   ever-higher demands on food quality and safety. This trend is driving
   food companies to adopt rapid, efficient, and comprehensive monitoring
   systems, highlighting the urgent need for fast and reliable detection
   methods. While non-invasive testing (NIT) techniques offer efficient and
   non-invasive assessment, the demand for intelligent data interpretation
   and automated decision-making is growing. Artificial intelligence (AI)
   provides powerful tools for extracting meaningful patterns, enabling
   intelligent, accurate, and scalable food quality monitoring. The
   integration of AI with NIT represents a critical advancement, not only
   enhancing detection accuracy such as calibration error reduction by
   10-20 % but also improving detection efficiency such as rapid screening
   within minutes for food quality and safety assessment. Scope and
   approach: Improving the reliability of detection results and expanding
   the scale of rapid detection can effectively enhance the application
   value of NIT techniques in food production and distribution. Therefore,
   the current review aims to systematically explore how AI can assist NIT
   in food quality and safety applications, with a specific focus on two
   fundamental dimensions: accuracy and efficiency. Covering a wide range
   of NIT techniques and food detection targets, the current review is
   structured around two core perspectives: (1) enhancing accuracy through
   factor calibration, data enhancement, feature extraction and model
   optimization; and (2) improving efficiency through automation and
   robotics, portable device, high-throughput mode and IoT and blockchain.
   By summarizing key methods and advances from these two perspectives,
   this review provides a comprehensive framework and technical reference
   to guide future research and practical applications in intelligent food
   quality and safety assessment. Key findings and conclusions: In summary,
   the integration of AI with NIT significantly enhances both accuracy and
   efficiency in food quality and safety assessment. Current challenges
   mainly involve limited interpretability, insufficient data diversity,
   and delays in industrial deployment. In the short term, progress is
   expected in interpretable and transferable AI models, multi-source
   sensor data fusion, and edge AI for real-time monitoring. In the longer
   term, disruptive technologies such as neural architecture search,
   neuromorphic computing, and quantum machine learning hold promise for
   transformative advances. By distinguishing feasible short-term
   developments from disruptive long-term opportunities, this review
   provides a roadmap to bridge scientific innovation and practical
   industrial application in AI-powered food NIT.

AB Digital twin construction (DTC) integrates digital representation of
   product design and process planning, automated monitoring on site,
   intelligent data interpretation, and predictive analytics to provide
   managers with situational awareness and guide subsequent cycles of
   production planning and control. This study presents a case study of a
   DTC system integrating building information modeling (BIM), the Internet
   of Things (IoT), and GIS for real-time monitoring and process
   optimization in an industrial silo construction project in Canada. The
   system consists of four key components: IoT sensors that collect
   real-time construction data, automated data transmission and storage,
   BIM-based design and planning models, and interactive dashboards for
   project monitoring and decision-making. The system enabled just-in-time
   pull delivery of steel elements, precise placement of components within
   the slip-formwork, and continuous progress tracking. As a result,
   construction time was reduced by 28% and material wastage decreased by
   15% due to data-driven decision-making and real-time monitoring. The
   primary contribution of this study is demonstrating a structured
   approach to integrating DTC technologies into construction workflows,
   providing a practical framework for bridging digital models with
   real-time execution. This research highlights how the integration of
   BIM, IoT, and GIS enhances construction accuracy, efficiency, and
   automation, addressing challenges related to interoperability, real-time
   monitoring, and predictive analytics. Despite challenges such as the
   initial setup costs and specialized staff training requirements, the
   long-term benefits, including improved resource allocation, cost
   savings, and enhanced project management capabilities, justify the
   investment. The findings suggest that adapting advanced DTC systems can
   significantly enhance construction productivity, accuracy, and
   sustainability, leading to better-managed and more efficient projects.
   Future research should explore scalability across different construction
   sectors and locations to further validate the economic and operational
   impact of this approach.

   technological advances reshaping the field-from microinjection and
   preconcentration modules to compact, high-sensitivity detection systems
   including ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis), fluorescence (FL),
   electrochemical detection (ECD), and mass spectrometry (MS). The
   integration of microcontrollers, AI-enhanced calibration routines, and
   IoT-enabled feedback loops has led to the rise of self-regulating
   analytical devices capable of real-time decision-making and autonomous
   operation. Additive manufacturing further accelerates innovation by
   enabling rapid prototyping and customization through three-dimensional
   (3D) printing of entire Laboratory-on-Chip (LOC) systems, detectors, and
   embedded electrodes. Despite these advances, several critical challenges
   remain. Issues in flow stability, sample compatibility, standardization,
   and long-term reliability continue to hinder widespread deployment in
   real-world environments. This review highlights both technical
   breakthroughs and unresolved limitations across pharmaceutical,
   environmental, clinical, forensic, and food safety domains. Special
   emphasis is placed on the convergence of hardware miniaturization with
   smart software architectures to create adaptive, scalable platforms.
   Looking ahead, future systems must prioritize interoperability, energy
   efficiency, and AI-guided control to realize the full potential of
   decentralized analytical diagnostics. Ultimately, the next generation of
   separation science will be shaped not only by miniaturization-but also
   by intelligent design, sustainable engineering, and integrative system
   thinking.

AB Purpose-Optimising resource utilisation on construction sites is
   essential for achieving key performance indicators related to cost, time
   and sustainability. While recent advances have explored the integration
   of 4D building information modelling (BIM) with technologies such as the
   Internet of things (IoT) and immersive tools, widespread adoption
   remains limited due to system complexity, scalability and integration
   challenges. This paper introduces the digital twins-based site resource
   monitoring (DTSRM) system as an integrated solution to support efficient
   and sustainable construction resource management.
   Design/methodology/approach-A research gap was identified through a
   critical literature review. A predictive DTSRM system was then developed
   in multiple phases, including the creation of digital twin (DT) models
   and components such as ontology, IoT networks and machine learning (ML)
   algorithms. The system was tested using IoT simulators and C# scripts to
   ensure sensor data integration and functional validity. Synthetic
   datasets, designed to realistically simulate construction site
   conditions, were generated using Python to evaluate the system's
   performance. Findings-DTSRM offers a real-time, integrated approach by
   collecting data from construction equipment and material storage through
   IoT sensors visualised within the BIM model. ML techniques enable the
   prediction of equipment productivity and the tracking of material
   consumption and inventory levels. This allows for timely, data-driven
   decisions that minimise delays and excess inventory costs. Practical
   implications-DTSRM enables project stakeholders to prioritise resource
   allocation across multiple sites based on live productivity and
   inventory data. By reducing waste and improving efficiency, it directly
   supports circular economy principles in construction. The DTSRM
   ontology, though currently focused on equipment and materials, can be
   extended to include human resources for productivity and health and
   safety monitoring. Originality/value-This research offers a practical,
   scalable solution that integrates DT, BIM, IoT and AI technologies to
   monitor construction resources in real time. Unlike many existing
   frameworks, DTSRM explicitly contributes to the circular economy by
   promoting resource efficiency, minimising waste and supporting informed
   decision-making across the construction lifecycle.

AB The digital twin, which integrates multidisciplinary attributes to
   achieve interactions between the virtual and the real worlds, has found
   numerous applications in the field of smart cities and transportation
   infrastructure. With the acceleration of urbanization, rail transit, as
   a key component of urban infrastructure, faces increasing challenges in
   maintenance and management. Traditional reactive maintenance methods can
   no longer meet the growing volume of user demands. This study presents
   an architecture of intelligent operation and maintenance platform for
   the rail transit infrastructure based on WebGIS, paving the way for a
   digital-twin solution driven by predictive maintenance. We present a
   case study of the Shanghai Metro Long Yang Road-Zhang Jiang High Tech
   experimental line, which demonstrates the significant advantages of our
   platform in real-time data integration, 3D visualization, and
   intelligent decision support. Dynamic simulation integrating finite
   element and multibody dynamics software further validate the
   effectiveness of digital twin technology in the identification and
   prediction of rail fastener damage.

   digital twin technology, advanced machine learning, and a private
   blockchain network to enhance data-driven decision making and
   operational efficiency in both public enterprises and small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The proposed cloud-based business
   intelligence model automates Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes,
   enables real-time analytics, and secures data integrity and transparency
   through blockchain-enabled audit trails. By implementing the proposed
   solution, Smart City and public service providers can significantly
   improve operational efficiency, including a 15% reduction in costs and a
   12% decrease in fuel consumption for waste management, as well as
   increased citizen engagement and transparency in Smart City governance.
   The digital twin component facilitated scenario simulations and
   proactive resource management, while the participatory governance module
   empowered citizens through transparent, immutable records of proposals
   and voting. This study also discusses technical, organizational, and
   regulatory challenges, such as data integration, scalability, and
   privacy compliance. The results indicate that the proposed approach
   offers a scalable and sustainable model for Smart City transformation,
   fostering citizen trust, regulatory compliance, and measurable

AB This research aims to assess the contribution of artificial intelligence
   (AI)-driven digital twin technology in improving the predictive planning
   of European smart cities, particularly in Greece. It considers the
   effect of specific elements including simulation accuracy, real-time
   data processing, artificial intelligence tools, and system readiness on
   the urban planning process. Structured questionnaires were administered
   to 301 urban professionals working in smart cities across Greece,
   focusing on their perceptions of the impact of digital twin features on
   predictive urban planning effectiveness. Respondents were asked how
   crucial they found the different features of digital twins in actually
   improving predictive urban planning. Measurement data were described
   using the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of
   variation, while categorical data were described using frequency
   distribution tables and percentages. This study revealed that the
   simulation fidelity, available real-time data integration, artificial
   intelligence analytics, and results- oriented monitoring system maturity
   have a positive impact on the accuracy, speed, and flexibility of urban
   planning. Some of the respondents noted these features as very useful
   for the prediction of urban conditions and decision-making purposes.
   Nevertheless, some drawbacks related to the computational load and data
   flow were also revealed. AI-driven digital twins are useful for
   improving the effectiveness of urban planning. However, they encounter
   technical issues; therefore, seeking to focus on system maturity and
   data integration is necessary for their successful implementation.
   Cities should adopt advanced digital twin technologies and enhance the
   compatibility of data and maintain AI transparency for better urban
   planning results.

AB Construction projects increasingly rely on processing vast amounts of
   data from multiple sources, including consultants (BIM), cloud-based
   project management platforms (e.g., Aconex), planning departments,
   construction sites, main contractors, and subcontractors. However,
   inefficiencies in data acquisition and reliance on manual data entry
   hinder real-time project analysis, delay notifications, and
   decision-making. This study introduces the Real-Time Data-Driven
   Construction Project Analysis Framework (RealCONs) to address these
   challenges by streamlining data flow and enhancing project performance.
   A comparative analysis used eight case studies four employing the
   existing approach and four utilising RealCONs-to assess improvements in
   data integration, early delay identification, and decision-making
   efficiency. The results, validated through Earned Value Management (EVM)
   and Earned Schedule Management (ESM) metrics, demonstrate that RealCONs
   significantly enhance project forecasting accuracy, schedule adherence,
   and cost management. Additionally, statistical analyses, including the
   Shapiro-Wilk test and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank analysis, confirm that
   RealCONs outperform the existing approach by reducing data collection
   and decision-making delays, enabling project managers to implement
   proactive mitigation strategies. These findings highlight RealCONs'
   potential to improve project efficiency, reduce costs, and optimise
   real-time construction management.

AB Manufacturing, consumer, transportation, and supply chain processes
   present significant challenges in monitoring, control, and design due to
   their inherently nonlinear nature and the difficulty of measuring
   critical variables in real time. The convergence of major innovations
   from the computer science field has the potential to revolutionize the
   engineering and control of complex industrial systems. Digital twinning
   and process simulation have been a staple of computers in process
   engineering for decades now. However, the advent of advanced sensor
   systems and big data integration, combined with generative AI and
   agentified AI (classic and quantum) systems, allows for much more
   granular and autonomous process control and real-time optimization of
   complex systems. Advanced process modeling, Agentic AI, and generative
   AI models have emerged as powerful tools to address the challenges of
   complex nonlinear systems. We propose here an integrated systems
   feedback and control architecture (SIC: Sense, Infer, Control) that
   leverages complementary process knowledge for enhanced real-time
   monitoring and decision-making, fully integrated into control system
   functions and the accompanying sensors. In this paper, we explore this
   integration of generative models in agentic AI ensembles into industrial
   processes through the lens of four recent industrial case studies: (1)
   the real-time optimization of motorsports strategy, (2) the development
   of indirect (soft) sensors for sustainable large-scale manufacturing
   operations, (3) the creation of sensor data-driven personalized health
   and cosmetic chemical formulations, and (4) the design of
   biomanufacturing systems using quantum and classic Agentic AI. These
   examples demonstrate how agentic and generative models, combined with
   full-scale process simulation and digital twinning, effectively augment
   process control, enabling advanced solutions for process optimization,
   quality improvement, and sustainable operations. The proposed SIC
   systems architecture serves to enhance process control automation by
   capturing complex nonlinear patterns and leveraging easily measurable
   variables. Generative models bridge gaps in process understanding,
   sensor technologies, control, and monitoring, offering actionable
   insights for efficient and informed decision-making across diverse
   industrial applications.

AB Urban decarbonisation requires governance models that overcome the
   fragmentation and rigidity of traditional urban planning. This article
   presents a systemic and digital framework for managing urban
   decarbonisation portfolios aligned with the EU Mission for
   Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities. Grounded in systems thinking and
   portfolio theory, this study develops an analytical taxonomy and an
   interactive digital tool to support strategic coordination,
   multistakeholder collaboration, and adaptive decision-making. The
   framework is empirically validated through the case of Madrid's Climate
   City Contract, demonstrating its functionality and transferability.
   Using a mixed-method approach-combining co-creation workshops,
   interviews, document analysis, and iterative prototyping-this research
   maps interdependencies among projects, actors, and levers of change. The
   digital tool enables real-time visualisation of collaboration patterns,
   gaps, and synergies, enhancing strategic foresight and coordination
   capacity. Findings reveal that 75% of initiatives in Madrid's CCC
   address climate adaptation, 80.36% are linked to knowledge generation,
   and key anchor projects serve as integrative hubs within the portfolio.
   This study concludes that the portfolio approach strengthens systemic
   innovation and reflexive governance by integrating digital
   infrastructures with collaborative planning processes. While challenges
   persist-including data integration, institutional capacity, and
   political dynamics-this research offers a replicable methodology for
   embedding mission-oriented strategies into urban governance. The digital
   portfolio emerges as a complementary governance tool that enhances
   transparency, organisational learning, and alignment across governance
   levels.

AB Introduction Precision agriculture relies on advanced technologies to
   optimize crop protection and resource utilization, ensuring sustainable
   and efficient farming practices. Anomaly detection plays a critical role
   in identifying and addressing irregularities, such as pest outbreaks,
   disease spread, or nutrient deficiencies, that can negatively impact
   yield. Traditional methods struggle with the complexity and variability
   of agricultural data collected from diverse sources.Methods To address
   these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates the
   Integrated Multi-Modal Smart Farming Network (IMSFNet) with the Adaptive
   Resource Optimization Strategy (AROS). IMSFNet employs multimodal data
   fusion and spatiotemporal modeling to provide accurate predictions of
   crop health and yield anomalies by leveraging data from UAVs,
   satellites, ground sensors, and weather stations. AROS dynamically
   optimizes resource allocation based on real-time environmental feedback
   and multi-objective optimization, balancing yield maximization, cost
   efficiency, and environmental sustainability.Results Experimental
   evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting
   anomalies and improving decision-making in precision
   agriculture.Discussion This framework sets a new standard for
   sustainable and data-driven crop protection strategies.

   platform. AI models are employed for data fusion, anomaly detection, and
   predictive analytics. In particular, the platform incorporates
   telematics-video fusion for enhanced trajectory accuracy and
   LiDAR-camera fusion for high-definition work-zone mapping. These
   capabilities support dynamic safety heatmaps, congestion forecasts, and

   technologies, data-driven decision-making, and interconnected
   infrastructure to enhance urban living and resource efficiency. Among
   these, Smart Water Management (SWM) is crucial for optimizing water
   distribution and reducing Non-Revenue Water (NRW) losses, a persistent
   challenge for utilities worldwide. Water leaks contribute significantly
   to NRW, necessitating real-time leak detection and management systems to
   minimize detection time and human effort. Achieving this requires
   seamless integration of SWM technologies, including advanced metering
   infrastructure, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial
   Intelligence (AI). While previous studies have explored various leak
   detection techniques, many lack a focused analysis of real-time data
   integration and automated alerts in SWM systems. This Systematic
   Literature Review (SLR) addresses this gap by examining advancements in
   automatic data collection, leak detection models, and real-time alert
   mechanisms. The findings highlight the growing potential of data-driven
   approaches to enhance leak detection accuracy and efficiency,
   particularly those leveraging flow and pressure data. Despite
   advancements, model accuracy, scalability, and real-world applicability
   remain. This review provides critical insights for future research,
   guiding the development of automated, AI-driven leak management systems
   to improve water distribution, minimize losses, and enhance
   sustainability in smart cities.

AB Despite numerous approaches tailored for specific components and vehicle
   types, the automotive industry lacks a unified framework that integrates
   diverse methodologies while addressing scalability, adaptability, and
   efficiency across conventional (CVs), electric (EVs), and autonomous
   vehicles (AVs). This study provides a taxonomic classification of
   vehicle health monitoring (VHM) and fault diagnosis techniques,
   highlighting the transformative role of advanced sensors, IoT
   integration, artificial intelligence (AI), and multi-sensor fusion.
   Through comparative evaluation of model-based, signal-based, and
   data-driven approaches, we identify their strengths, limitations, and
   optimal applications in different vehicular contexts supported by
   quantitative performance metrics. Key findings demonstrate that
   AI-driven fault diagnosis in CVs achieves up to 95 % accuracy in early
   mechanical failure detection, reducing maintenance costs and preventing
   catastrophic failures. Advanced battery monitoring techniques for EVs
   improve energy efficiency (15-20 %) and extend battery lifespan (10-15
   %), addressing critical range anxiety and sustainability concerns. In
   AVs, sensor fusion and AI-based prediction achieve 99% reliability in
   real-time decision-making, enhancing operational safety and passenger
   confidence. We propose a novel conceptual framework integrating sensors,
   IoT, AI, and big data analytics to enhance VHM capabilities across all
   vehicle types. This framework addresses challenges in heterogeneous data
   integration, efficiency, and real-time processing in dynamic automotive
   environments. Future research addresses cybersecurity vulnerabilities,
   optimising AI models for edge computing deployments, developing AI
   techniques for transparent diagnostics, and leveraging
   vehicle-to-vehicle communication protocols to improve fault detection
   accuracy. This study contributes to the reactive to predictive
   maintenance strategies, potentially transforming maintenance practices
   across the transportation sector while enhancing vehicle reliability,
   safety, and sustainability.

   demand advanced systems capable of real-time monitoring, adaptability,
   and data-driven decision-making. This paper introduces a novel runtime
   condition model to enhance interoperability, data integration, and
   decision support within intelligent manufacturing environments. The
   model encapsulates key manufacturing elements, including asset
   management, relationships, key performance indicators (KPIs),
   capabilities, data structures, constraints, and configurations. A key
   innovation is the integration of a knowledge graph enriched with
   embedding techniques, enabling the inference of missing relationships,
   dynamic reasoning, and predictive analytics. The proposed model was
   validated through a case study conducted in collaboration with TQC
   Automation Ltd., using their MicroApplication Leak Test System (MALT). A
   dataset of over 9,000 unique test configurations demonstrated the
   model's capabilities in representing runtime conditions, managing
   operational parameters, and optimising test configurations. The enriched
   knowledge graph facilitated advanced analyses, providing actionable
   insights into test outcomes and enabling proactive decision-making.
   Empirical results showcase the model's ability to harmonise diverse data
   sources, infer missing connections, and improve runtime adaptability.
   This study highlights the potential of combining runtime modelling with
   knowledge graphs to address the challenges of modern manufacturing.
   Future research will explore the model's application to additional

AB Nomograms are increasingly recognized as indispensable clinical
   prediction tools, offering individualized risk estimates through
   interpretable and visually intuitive formats. Their integration into
   urologic oncology has significantly advanced precision medicine by
   enabling refined risk stratification for patients with urological
   malignancies. This review provides a concise yet comprehensive overview
   of the development, clinical application, and future prospects of
   nomograms in urologic oncology. We first outline the essential
   methodological framework for constructing valid prediction models,
   including outcome definition, predictor selection, model building, and
   statistical evaluation using discrimination and calibration metrics.
   Internal validation techniques such as cross-validation and
   bootstrapping are highlighted as safeguards against overfitting, while
   external validation is emphasized to ensure generalizability across
   diverse clinical contexts. Twelve representative nomograms are examined,
   classified by display type and implementation format, to illustrate
   their clinical relevance and limitations. While regression-based models
   remain widely used, emerging approaches incorporating artificial
   intelligence and machine learning offer enhanced predictive accuracy but
   pose challenges in interpretability and integration into electronic
   health records. Interactive decision-support tools are also gaining
   prominence, promoting real-time, patient-centered care. Despite existing
   limitations, such as static outputs, dependence on retrospective data,
   and inconsistent methodological standards, nomograms continue to
   facilitate precise and evidence-based decision-making. Looking ahead,
   future models must prioritize transparency, dynamic updating, multimodal
   data integration, and adherence to established reporting guidelines.
   Through rigorous development and thoughtful implementation, nomograms
   will remain pivotal instruments in delivering personalized, high-quality
   care in urologic oncology.

AB Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health warning
   that increases mortality, morbidity, and medical expenses. Effective AMR
   surveillance is essential to guide interventions and maintain treatment
   efficacy. While AMR surveillance is studied in various healthcare
   settings, data sources in primary care settings need to be evaluated.Aim
   To identify the value of utilizing AMR surveillance data in primary care
   settings to inform community antimicrobial stewardship (AMS)
   practices.Methods Eligibility criteria included primary studies,
   randomized and nonrandomised controlled trials, observational studies,
   surveys, qualitative studies, mixed-method studies, and grey literature
   in primary care published worldwide from 2001 to 2024.Results Our review
   of 21 included studies emphasized the significance of utilizing AMR
   surveillance data to enhance clinical care. Clinicians need to better
   understand the local AMR pattern when prescribing primary care
   antibiotics. Despite limitations, educational interventions can change
   prescribing behaviour. AMR increased because local susceptibility data
   frequently did not inform empirical antibiotic treatment. Digital and
   geospatial platforms could enhance surveillance with institutional
   support and standardized data integration.Conclusion This analysis
   highlights the need for user-friendly, real-time, and easily accessible
   data visualization platforms to improve AMR surveillance and AMS in
   primary care. Addressing data accessibility and providing training and
   education are crucial elements. Standardising data and utilizing digital
   technologies can improve decision-making and antibiotic prescribing.
   These elements must be incorporated into a consistent and adaptive plan
   for effective AMS interventions and public health outcomes.

AB Introduction The regional disparity in higher education access can only
   be met when there are strategies for sustainable development and
   diversification of the economy, as envisioned in Saudi Vision 2030.
   Currently, 70% of universities are concentrated in the Central and
   Eastern regions, leaving the Northern and Southern parts of the country
   with limited opportunities.Methods The study created a framework with
   sensors and generative adversarial networks (GANs) that optimize the
   distribution of medical universities, supporting equity in access to
   education and balanced regional development. The research applies an
   artificial intelligence (AI)-driven framework that combines sensor data
   with GAN-based models to perform real-time geographic and demographic
   data analyses on the placement of higher education institutions
   throughout Saudi Arabia. This framework analyzes multisensory data by
   examining strategic university placement impacts on regional economies,
   social mobility, and the environment. Scenario modeling was used to
   simulate potential outcomes due to changes in university
   distribution.Results The findings indicated that areas with a higher
   density of universities experience up to 20% more job opportunities and
   a higher GDP growth of up to 15%. The GAN-based simulations reveal that
   redistributive educational institutions in underrepresented regions
   could decrease environmental impacts by about 30% and enhance access.
   More specifically, strategic placement in underserved areas is
   associated with a reduction of approximately 10% in
   unemployment.Discussion The research accentuates the need to include AI
   and sensor technology to develop educational infrastructures. The
   proposed framework can be used for continuous monitoring and dynamic
   adaptation of university strategies to align them with evolving economic
   and environmental objectives. The study explains the transformative
   potential of AI-enabled solutions to further equal access to education
   for sustainable regional development throughout Saudi Arabia.

AB The capacity of Dataspace enables the distribution of heterogeneous data
   from several sources and domains and has attracted attention for
   resolving data integration challenges. Drone data sharing faces
   challenges such as protecting privacy and security, building trust and
   dependability, controlling latency and scalability, facilitating
   real-time data processing, and preserving the caliber of shared models.
   Therefore, sixth-generation (6G) networks provide high throughput and
   low latency to improve drone operations; security issues are exacerbated
   by the sensitive nature of shared data and the lack of centralized
   monitoring. To address the challenges, this paper presents a conceptual
   framework for a Dataspace in the Sky to enable secure and efficient
   drone data-sharing within 6G networks in the transition from Industry
   4.0 to Industry 5.0. The Dataspace in the Sky integrates Federated
   Learning (FL), a decentralized Machine Learning (ML) approach that
   enhances security and privacy by sharing models instead of raw data,
   facilitating effective drone collaboration. However, the quality of
   shared local models often suffers due to inconsistent data contributions
   and unreliable recording mechanisms, which can undermine the performance
   of FL. To tackle the challenges, the framework employs blockchain (BC)
   to decentralize and secure the Dataspace, ensuring the integrity of
   contribution records and improving the reliability of shared models.
   Dataspace in the Sky empowered decentralized data sharing which
   addresses latency issues by decentralizing decision-making and enhances
   trust and reliability by leveraging immutable and transparent BC
   mechanisms. The robustness of Dataspace in the Sky solution is not only
   secures drone-sharing operations in 6G environments but enables the
   development of citizen-friendly mobility services, expanding
   opportunities across smart environments.

AB Real-scene 3D digital campuses are essential for improving the accuracy
   and effectiveness of spatial data representation, facilitating informed
   decision-making for university administrators, optimizing resource
   management, and enriching user engagement for students and faculty.
   However, current approaches to constructing these digital environments
   face several challenges. They often rely on costly commercial platforms,
   struggle with integrating heterogeneous datasets, and require complex
   workflows to achieve both high precision and comprehensive campus
   coverage. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a systematic
   multi-source data fusion approach that employs open-source technologies
   to generate a real-scene 3D digital campus. A case study of Lanzhou
   Jiaotong University is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of this
   approach. Firstly, oblique photography based on unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAVs) is used to capture large-scale, high-resolution images of the
   campus area, which are then processed using open-source software to
   generate an initial 3D model. Afterward, a high-resolution model of the
   campus buildings is then created by integrating the UAV data, while 3D
   Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) building data
   provide a 3D overview of the surrounding campus area, resulting in a
   comprehensive 3D model for a real-scene digital campus. Finally, the 3D
   model is visualized on the web using Cesium, which enables
   functionalities such as real-time data loading, perspective switching,
   and spatial data querying. Results indicate that the proposed approach
   can effectively get rid of reliance on expensive proprietary systems,
   while rapidly and accurately reconstructing a real-scene digital campus.
   This framework not only streamlines data harmonization but also offers
   an open-source, practical, cost-effective solution for real-scene 3D
   digital campus construction, promoting further research and applications
   in twin city, Virtual Reality (VR), and Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS).

AB As industrial systems become more complex and interconnected, diagnosing
   faults accurately and in real time has become increasingly challenging.
   This paper explores how combining artificial intelligence with digital
   twin technology can address these challenges. We focus on developing
   hybrid Artificial intelligence models that leverage diverse data sources
   to enhance fault detection and diagnosis, enabling secure and
   distributed diagnostics. Digital twins, virtual models of physical
   systems, are shown to enhance predictive maintenance and decision-making
   by providing real-time system insights. What sets our work apart is the
   way we integrate these technologies to create scalable, adaptive, and
   context-aware diagnostic solutions. We demonstrate the potential of this
   approach across applications such as smart grids, manufacturing, and
   autonomous systems. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners
   with a practical and forward-looking framework for developing
   intelligent, reliable fault diagnosis systems in today's data-rich

AB Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the landscape of Traditional
   Chinese Medicine (TCM). This review covers the latest applications of
   LLMs in TCM, including literature analysis, data mining, TCM knowledge
   management, diagnosis simulation and clinical decision making. LLMs can
   analyze large quantities of TCM literature and medical records to
   extract critical information, classify prescriptions, and build TCM
   knowledge maps to help researchers quickly grasp state-of-the-art and
   future research trends. LLMs can provide initial diagnostic
   recommendations by analyzing textual information such as a patient's
   symptom description and medical history, enabling the optimization of
   TCM therapy and the training of TCM practitioners. Compared with
   traditional tools, LLMs can significantly improve the efficiency and
   accuracy of bibliographic analysis and TCM prescription classification,
   and offer new potential for data-driven standardized TCM diagnosis.
   However, challenges remain, including the standardization of TCM
   terminology and data formats, integration of different data sources,
   timely knowledge updates, and the interpretability and credibility of
   results generated by LLMs. Future research on standardized templates for
   patient symptom description, multimodal data fusion techniques, and
   real-time knowledge update systems is warranted to improve the
   transparency and interpretability of LLMs. This review highlights the
   potential of LLMs to modernize TCM research and practice, providing an
   up-to-date reference for data scientists, biomedical engineers, and TCM
   practitioners.

TI A Modal Fusion Deep Clustering Method for Multi-sensor Fault Diagnosis

AB Objective Rotating machinery is essential across various industrial
   sectors, including energy, aerospace, and manufacturing. However, these
   machines operate under complex and variable conditions, making timely
   and accurate fault detection a significant challenge. Traditional
   diagnostic methods, which use a single sensor and modality, often miss
   critical features, particularly subtle fault signatures. This can result
   in reduced reliability, increased downtime, and higher maintenance
   costs. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel modal fusion
   deep clustering approach for multi-sensor fault diagnosis in rotating
   machinery. The main objectives are to: (1) improve feature extraction
   through time-frequency transformations that reveal important
   temporal-spectral patterns, (2) implement an attention-based modality
   fusion strategy that integrates complementary information from various
   sensors, and (3) use a deep clustering framework to identify fault types
   without needing labeled training data. Methods The proposed approach
   utilizes a multi-stage pipeline for thorough feature extraction and
   analysis. First, raw multi-sensor signals, such as vibration data
   collected under different load and speed conditions, are preprocessed
   and transformed with the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). This
   converts time-domain signals into time-frequency representations,
   highlighting distinct frequency components related to various fault
   conditions. Next, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) model temporal
   dependencies and capture long-range correlations, while Convolutional
   AutoEncoders (CAEs) learn hierarchical spatial features from the
   transformed data. By combining GRUs and CAEs, the framework encodes both
   temporal and structural patterns, creating richer and more robust
   representations than traditional methods that rely solely on either
   technique or handcrafted features. A key innovation is the modality
   fusion attention mechanism. In multi-sensor environments, individual
   sensors typically capture complementary aspects of system behavior.
   Simply concatenating their outputs can lead to suboptimal results due to
   noise and irrelevant information. The proposed attention-based fusion
   calculates modality-specific affinity matrices to assess the
   relationship and importance of each sensor modality. With learnable
   attention weights, the framework prioritizes the most informative
   modalities while diminishing the impact of less relevant ones. This
   ensures the fused representation captures complementary information,
   resulting in improved discriminative power. Finally, an unsupervised
   clustering module is integrated into the deep learning pipeline. Rather
   than depending on labeled data, the model assigns samples to clusters by
   refining cluster assignments iteratively using a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
   divergence-based objective. Initially, a soft cluster distribution is
   created from the learned features. A target distribution is then
   computed to sharpen and define cluster boundaries. By continuously
   minimizing the KL divergence between these distributions, the model
   self-optimizes over time, producing well-separated clusters
   corresponding to distinct fault types without supervision. Results and
   Discussions The proposed approach's effectiveness is illustrated using
   multi-sensor bearing and gearbox datasets. Compared to conventional
   unsupervised methods-like traditional clustering algorithms or
   single-domain feature extraction techniques-this framework significantly
   enhances clustering accuracy and fault recognition rates.
   Experimental results show recognition accuracies of approximately 99.16%
   on gearbox data and 98.63% on bearing data, representing a notable
   advancement over existing state-of-the-art techniques. These impressive
   results stem from the synergistic effects of advanced feature
   extraction, modality fusion, and iterative clustering refinement. By
   extracting time-frequency features through STFT, the method captures a
   richer representation than relying solely on raw time-domain signals.
   The use of GRUs incorporates temporal information, enabling the capture
   of dynamic signal changes that may indicate evolving fault patterns.
   Additionally, CAEs reveal meaningful spatial structures from
   time-frequency data, resulting in low-dimensional yet highly informative
   embeddings. The modality fusion attention mechanism further enhances
   these benefits by emphasizing relevant modalities, such as vibration
   data from various sensor placements or distinct physical principles,
   thus leveraging their complementary strengths. Through the iterative
   minimization of KL divergence, the clustering process becomes more
   discriminative. Initially broad and overlapping cluster boundaries are
   progressively refined, allowing the model to converge toward stable and
   well-defined fault groupings. This unsupervised approach is particularly
   valuable in practical scenarios, where obtaining labeled data is costly
   and time-consuming. The model's ability to learn directly from unlabeled
   signals enables continuous monitoring and adaptation, facilitating
   timely interventions and reducing the risk of unexpected machine
   failures. The discussion emphasizes the adaptability of the proposed
   method. Industrial systems continuously evolve, and fault patterns can
   change over time due to aging, maintenance, or shifts in operational
   conditions. The unsupervised method can be periodically retrained or
   updated with new unlabeled data. This allows it to monitor changes in
   machinery health and quickly detect new fault conditions without the
   need for manual annotation. Additionally, the attention-based modality
   fusion is flexible enough to support the inclusion of new sensor types
   or measurement channels, potentially enhancing diagnostic performance as
   richer data sources become available. Conclusions This study presents a
   modal fusion deep clustering framework designed for the multi-sensor
   fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. By combining time-frequency
   transformations with GRU-and CAE-based deep feature encoders,
   attention-driven modality fusion, and KL divergence-based unsupervised
   clustering, this approach outperforms traditional methods in accuracy,
   robustness, and scalability. Key contributions include a comprehensive
   multi-domain feature extraction pipeline, an adaptive modality fusion
   strategy for heterogeneous sensor data integration, and a refined deep
   clustering mechanism that achieves high diagnostic accuracy without
   relying on labeled training samples. Looking ahead, there are several
   promising directions. Adding more modalities-like acoustic emissions,
   temperature signals, or electrical measurements-could lead to richer
   feature sets. Exploring semi-supervised or few-shot extensions may
   further enhance performance by utilizing minimal labeled guidance when
   available. Implementing the proposed model in an industrial setting,
   potentially for real-time use, would also validate its practical
   benefits for maintenance decision-making, helping to reduce operational
   costs and extend equipment life.

AB Background: The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the
   progression of various cancers, influencing both tumor growth and
   therapeutic responses. Comprising multiple cellular components such as
   cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, blood vessels, and
   the extracellular matrix (ECM). Moreover, therapeutic interventions like
   chemotherapy and radiotherapy can further modify their composition,
   potentially affecting treatment outcomes. Aim: This review aims to
   examine the role of the TME in cancer progression, focusing on its
   components and the potential of targeted imaging for therapeutic and
   diagnostic applications. It explores how understanding the TME's
   cellular heterogeneity and response to treatment could improve cancer
   management, particularly through molecular imaging. Methods: We reviewed
   preclinical and clinical studies that investigated TME-targeted imaging
   agents, including radiotracers and biomarkers associated with CAFs,
   cancer stem cells (CSCs), ECM, and immune cells. Various imaging
   modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), and single-photon emission computed tomography
   (SPECT), were explored for their potential in diagnosing and monitoring
   cancer progression. Results: Studies identified specific biomarkers such
   as fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and collagen type I as key
   targets for imaging TME components. Radiotracers like [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04
   and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 demonstrated improved diagnostic sensitivity and
   tumor-specific imaging compared to conventional markers like [18F]-FDG.
   These imaging agents enabled better visualization of TME-related
   factors. Conclusion: Targeting the TME using advanced imaging techniques
   holds significant promise for enhancing cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and
   therapeutic monitoring. The integration of molecular imaging with TME
   biomarkers offers a path to more personalized and effective cancer
   treatments.

AB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is the foundation for
   high-precision localization, environmental awareness, and autonomous
   decision-making of autonomous vehicles. It has developed rapidly, but
   there are still challenges such as sensor errors, data fusion, and
   real-time computing. This paper proposes an optimization-based fusion
   algorithm that integrates IMU data, visual data and LiDAR data to
   construct a high-frequency visual-inertial odometry. The odometry is
   employed to obtain the relative pose transformation during the LiDAR
   data acquisition process, and eliminate the distortion of the point
   cloud by interpolation. By utilizing the local curvatures, some edge and
   plane features are extracted by LiDAR after removing the distortion,
   which are further combined with local map alignment to reconstruct the
   LiDAR constrains. In addition, the LiDAR odometer can be obtained
   through the initial values provided by high-frequency visual-inertial
   odometry. To address the cumulative error in odometers, adjacent
   keyframe and multi descriptor fusion loop constraints are combined to
   construct back-end optimization constraints, solving for high-accuracy
   localization results and constructing a 3D point cloud map of the
   surroundings. Compared with some classical algorithm, results show that
   the accuracy of this paper's algorithm is better than the laser SLAM
   method and the multi-sensor fusion SLAM method. Besides, the
   laser-assisted multi-feature visual-inertial odometry localization
   accuracy is also better than that of the single-feature visual-inertial
   odometry. In summary, the newly proposed SLAM method can largely improve
   the accuracy of odometry in real traffic scenarios.

AB The emergence of autonomous driving technologies has been significantly
   influenced by advancements in perception systems. Traditional
   single-agent detection models, while effective in certain scenarios,
   exhibit limitations in complex environments, necessitating the shift
   towards collaborative detection models. While numerous studies have
   investigated the fundamental architecture and primary elements within
   this domain, comprehensive analyses focusing on the evolution from
   single-agent-based detection systems to collaborative detection systems
   are notably absent. This paper provides a comprehensive examination of
   this transition, delineating the development from single agent to
   collaborative perception models in autonomous driving. Initially, this
   paper delves into single-agent detection models, discussing their
   capabilities, limitations, and application scenarios. Subsequently, the
   focus shifts to collaborative detection models, which leverage Vehicle-
   to-Everything (V2X) communication to enhance perception and
   decision-making in complex environments. Fundamental concepts about
   mainstream collaborative approaches and mechanisms are reviewed to
   present the general organization of collaborative detection models.
   Furthermore, we critically evaluates various collaborative models,
   comparing their performance, data fusion strategies, and adaptability in
   dynamic settings. The integration of V2X-enabled Internet-of-Vehicles
   (IoV) introduces a pivotal evolution in the transition from
   single-agent-based detection to multi-agent collaborative sensing. This
   advancement allows for real-time interaction of sensory information
   between vehicles, augmenting the development of collaborative sensing.
   However, the interaction of sensory information also increases the load
   on the network, highlighting the need for strategies that achieve a
   balance between communication overhead and the improvement in perception
   capabilities. We concludes with future perspectives, emphasizing the
   potential issues the development of collaborative detection models will
   meet and the promising directions for future research.

AB Background: Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) are electronic
   systems used to conduct assessments based on patient characteristics and
   to offer treatment recommendations for clinicians to consider during
   their decision -making processes. CDSSs are needed by mental health
   helpline services to optimise service delivery for clients and
   counsellors, while also collecting the data needed for the
   administration of the service. The aim of this systematic review was to
   provide a comprehensive overview of the design and implementation of
   CDSSs in mental health helpline services, to identify current issues in
   their design and implementation, and to provide recommendations that may
   address any identified issues. Materials and Methods: Keywords related
   to mental health, helplines and CDSS were searched in three databases in
   April 2022 and September 2023. In total, 21 articles published between
   1987 and 2023 met the inclusion criteria. Results: The objectives of the
   mental health helplines services included in this study included suicide
   risk reduction, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of mental health
   disorders, and support of clinicians or counsellors in making better and
   more accurate decisions by incorporating real-time data analysis. All
   included studies demonstrated co -design activities, however, the level
   and degree of end -user involvement differed across the studies. The
   factors that impact CDSS implementation success depend on the design and
   implementation approach, user experience and context. CDSS evaluations
   in the included studies assessed reliability, utility, user
   friendlessness, cost-effectiveness and participant satisfaction. Few
   studies considered data privacy and integration issues. Conclusion: More
   interactive methods should be adopted during the design of CDSSs for
   mental health helpline services. Increased frequency and intensity of
   user participation in system design, that goes beyond providing feedback
   on research materials, enables user opinions to be fully understood and
   addressed. Comprehensive frameworks should be developed to guide
   requirements gathering, system design and system evaluation practices.
   These factors are interrelated and may impact implementation success.
   From the outset therefore, the design of a CDSS in the mental health
   helpline domain should consider the full system development cycle.

AB Precision irrigation systems have become indispensable tools in modern
   agriculture due to their ability to address water management challenges
   and optimize bamboo productivity. This paper presents a novel innovation
   called AquaBamboo, a next-generation precision irrigation system
   designed to revolutionize sustainable bamboo water management. The paper
   outlines the shortcomings of traditional irrigation methods,
   highlighting their inefficient water management for bamboo, lack of
   real-time data integration, and limited precision. This suggested
   approach overcomes these challenges by integrating IT sensors, advanced
   analytics, and predictive modelling to deliver water precisely tailored
   to each bamboo species' requirements. The system's dynamic adaptability
   to changing environmental factors ensures optimal water delivery,
   enhancing bamboo health and yield while minimizing water waste.
   AquaBamboo's holistic approach not only improves resource efficiency but
   also contributes to sustainable agriculture practices, aligning with the
   principles of responsible water management. The significance of this
   approach lies in its potential to transform conventional irrigation
   practices, optimize water utilization, promote bamboo species' health,
   and advance the sustainability of all bamboo agricultural operations.
   This paper offers a comprehensive understanding of AquaBamboo's
   features, advantages, and innovative contributions to precision bamboo

AB Harmful Algal and Cyanobacterial Bloom (HACB) threaten aquatic
   ecosystems, human health, and the economy. Many factors influence these
   dynamic events, which are often difficult to detect until the late
   stages of growth. The inclusion of an Early Warning System (EWS) can be
   instrumental in identifying hazards and preventing or at least
   minimizing their impact. Traditional monitoring approaches often fail to
   provide the real-time, high-resolution data needed for effective early
   warnings. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies
   offers a promising avenue to address these limitations by creating a
   network of interconnected sensors capable of continuously collecting and
   transmitting data from various aquatic environments. In this paper, we
   present DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI, an advanced web application that extends the
   capabilities of the DEVS-BLOOM framework, providing a user-friendly
   interface that supports different user roles. The application includes
   an interface to manage users and permissions, dashboards to inspect data
   (from sensors, Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), weather stations,
   etc.), train AI models, explore their predictions, and facilitate
   decision-making through notification of early warnings. A key feature of
   DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI is the Scenario Configuration Editor (SCE). This
   interactive tool allows for users to design and configure the deployment
   of monitoring infrastructure within a water body, enhancing the system's
   adaptability to user-defined simulation scenarios. This paper also
   investigates the practical implementation of an IoT-based EWS,
   discussing design considerations, sensor technologies, and communication
   protocols essential for seamless data integration and effective
   operation of the EWS.

AB Different geospatial and geotechnical parameters change over time and
   can affect the residual soil stability on a slope. Thus, it is essential
   to analyze the stability of slopes continuously to identify the
   potential landslide sections. The stability of slopes is defined by the
   factor of safety (FOS). To track the immediate changes in soil
   stability, it is essential to monitor multiple environmental parameters
   using Internet of Things (IoT) devices for real-time decision making.
   Further, the relation between the environmental parameters and FOS is
   nonlinear which makes it a multivariate and complex problem. To motivate
   the above-mentioned challenges, in this article, we propose a new
   fusion-based bag-of-neural network (FuBoNN) model for predicting FOS
   using a set of IoT devices in edge networks. Besides that, for
   increasing the prediction accuracy of FOS, multiple laboratory data
   related to FOS are fused over the monitoring parameters and prepare a
   rich data set. The newly created fused data set is fed into the
   population-based neural network (NN) and the best NN is selected in each
   iteration that transfers its knowledge to the population. The fused data
   set is categorized into four class labels to simulate the stability
   issue of residual soil and fed to the input of the proposed FuBoNN
   model, which provides a 0.0003% of error in predicting the multiple
   categories of the FOS. The proposed work is compared to the standard
   machine learning models that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
   model and produce 2.5% improved prediction accuracy over the existing
   ones.

AB Maritime transportation is vital for global trade, yet safety challenges
   persist, especially with increasing vessel density and narrow waterways.
   The standard Closest Point of Approach (CPA) method, used to estimate
   collision risk, has limitations due to its reliance on constant Course
   Over Ground (COG) and Speed Over Ground (SOG) assumptions, neglecting
   dynamic vessel behaviours, true ship dimensions, and environmental
   influences. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces an
   enhanced CPA (eCPA) method that counters these deficits by incorporating
   ship trajectory predictions, probabilistic risk assessment, and
   real-time data integration. The eCPA method includes useradjustable
   tools for trajectory interpolation, prediction, and anomaly elimination,
   making it adaptable to various maritime scenarios. Extensive testing in
   encounter scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in
   improving maritime safety through robust and probabilistic estimation of
   encounter points. This method aligns with the Self-Integration and
   Self-Organising Systems (SISSY) initiative, exhibiting how autonomous
   maritime operations can benefit from self-improving and self-integrating
   systems to enhance navigation safety and efficiency.

AB Conventional electronic health record information displays are not
   optimized for efficient information processing. Graphical displays that
   integrate patient information can improve information processing,
   especially in data-rich environments such as critical care. We propose
   an adaptable and reusable approach to patient information display with
   modular graphical components (widgets). We had two study objectives.
   First, reduce numerous widget prototype alternatives to preferred
   designs. Second, derive widget design feature recommendations. Using
   iterative human-centered design methods, we interviewed experts to hone
   design features of widgets displaying frequently measured data elements,
   e.g., heart rate, for acute care patient monitoring and real-time
   clinical decision-making. Participant responses to design queries were
   coded to calculate feature-set agreement, average prototype score, and
   prototype agreement. Two iterative interview cycles covering 64 design
   queries and 86 prototypes were needed to reach consensus on six feature
   sets. Interviewers agreed that line graphs with a smoothed or averaged
   trendline, 24-h timeframe, and gradient coloring for urgency were useful
   and informative features. Moreover, users agreed that widgets should
   include key functions: (1) adjustable reference ranges, (2) expandable
   timeframes, and (3) access to details on demand. Participants stated
   graphical widgets would be used to identify correlating patterns and
   compare abnormal measures across related data elements at a specific
   time. Combining theoretical principles and validated design methods was
   an effective and reproducible approach to designing widgets for
   healthcare displays. The findings suggest our widget design features and
   recommendations match critical care clinician expectations for graphical
   information display of continuous and frequently updated patient data.

AB In order to solve the problem of resource waste in colleges and

   information fusion method, which can be used to normalize, analyze and
   predict the multi-source data such as natural, humanistic and
   spatio-temporal data on campus so as to meet the application
   requirements for high-level decision-making. With this method, firstly,
   the event object model is used to normalize multi-source data. Then, the
   multidimensional situational information fusion mechanism of twice
   reasoning is used to obtain the real-time situation and equipment
   control scheme of the campus so that real-time intelligent semantic
   understanding is realized. In the process of reasoning, the improved KNN
   prediction model is used to predict situational trends, and the
   prediction information is used to continue deep reasoning and mining.
   Finally, the real-time energy-saving regulation is carried out through
   control instructions. In addition, through simulation verification,
   experimental results show that this method can quickly identify,
   integrate, and predict the current real-time situation and generate
   reasoning results, and finally achieve the goal of intelligent control
   for energy saving on campus.

AB The trend of coordinated development of intelligent and connected
   vehicles is driving the continuous expansion of application scenarios
   and service functions for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The IoV has
   evolved from basic in-vehicle information services to intelligent
   networking, enhancing perception and decision-making. It is now
   developing towards coordinated vehicle-infrastructure control with
   moderate sensing and decision-making. However, the traditional
   separation of sensing, communication, and computation functions-and even
   their pairwise integrations, such as Integrated Sensing and
   Communication (ISAC), Integrated Communication and Computation (ICC),
   and Integrated Sensing and Computation (ISC)-create systemic
   inefficiencies like data redundancy and resource imbalance, which pose a
   critical bottleneck to the advancement of IoV. The unique
   characteristics of the IoV, particularly its mission objectives centered
   on safety and sensing, and the highly dynamic, resource-constrained
   network environment-compound these systemic inefficiencies,
   necessitating a dedicated investigation into an IoV-specific ISCC
   paradigm. Motivated by this, this paper provides the first in-depth,
   IoV-centric survey of the ISCC paradigm. First, we comprehensively
   review the development trajectory of the IoV, and based on this
   evolutionary path, define and categorize the development of ISCC into
   three distinct phases-Collaborative, Fusion, and Integrated-to clarify
   its integration process. Second, we analyze the limitations of partial
   integration paradigms (ISAC, ICC, ISC) and then establish a
   comprehensive taxonomy of ISCC implementation pathways, encompassing
   both physical-layer signal integration and network-level task-oriented
   resource management. Third, we survey the preliminary applications and
   research on the ISCC in the IoV and related fields. Finally, we outline
   the challenges and potential solutions to facilitate the realization of
   the ISCC in the IoV.

AB Throughout the building's entire lifetime, the construction industry
   faces significant challenges in the areas of real-time monitoring,
   energy efficiency, and intelligent decision-making. Traditional
   approaches lack the responsiveness and integration necessary for smart
   building operations. As a consequence, they frequently result in delays,
   inefficiencies in resource utilization, and unsatisfactory interior
   environments. This research presents a unique framework for enhancing
   building operations and maintenance, based on Multi-Dimensional Digital
   Twin Technology-assisted Building Information Modeling (MD-DTT-BIM). The
   purpose of this framework is to address the challenges that have been
   identified. The proposed system utilizes real-time data integration,
   simulation, and predictive analytics to enhance the planning and
   management of construction projects and facilities simultaneously. The
   MD-DTT-BIM model achieves substantial performance improvements over
   existing models, as demonstrated by experimental validation. These
   improvements include a 97.6% increase in operational efficiency, a 96.7%
   improvement in real-time monitoring accuracy, a 95.3% reduction in
   energy consumption, a 94.3% rise in occupant satisfaction, and a 98.3%
   accuracy in predicting the quality of the indoor environment. Based on
   these findings, it is evident that the model has the potential to
   facilitate a transition toward more intelligent and environmentally
   responsible building methods.

   contribute to contamination, spoilage and foodborne illnesses,
   highlighting the need for innovative and technology-driven control
   strategies. Emerging digital tools, particularly blockchain technology
   and artificial intelligence (AI), offer new opportunities for enhancing
   biofilm management. Blockchain ensures secure, real-time traceability of
   hygiene records, contamination events and compliance activities across
   the supply chain. Complementing this, AI technologies such as machine
   learning and sensor-based analytics support early detection of microbial
   growth, anomaly identification and predictive risk assessment. Together,
   these tools promote data-driven decision-making and more proactive

AB Digital Twins (DTs) are transforming manufacturing by bridging the

   analytics, and enhanced decision making. In Industry 4.0, DTs facilitate
   automation and data integration, while Industry 5.0 emphasizes
   human-centric, resilient, and sustainable production. However,
   implementing DTs in robotic metal additive manufacturing (AM) remains
   challenging because of the complexity of the wire-based laser metal

   demand for advanced defect detection to ensure high-quality prints. This
   work proposes a structured DT architecture for a robotic wire-based LMD
   cell, following a standard framework. Three DT implementations were
   developed. First, a real-time 3D simulation in RoboDK, integrated with a
   2D Node-RED dashboard, enabled motion validation and live process
   monitoring via MQTT (message queuing telemetry transport) telemetry,
   minimizing toolpath errors and collisions. Second, an Industrial
   IoT-based system using KUKA iiQoT (Industrial Internet of Things Quality
   of Things) facilitated predictive maintenance by analyzing motor loads,
   joint temperatures, and energy consumption, allowing early anomaly
   detection and reducing unplanned downtime. Third, the Meltio dashboard
   provided real-time insights into the laser temperature, wire tension,
   and deposition accuracy, ensuring adaptive control based on live
   telemetry. Additionally, a prescriptive analytics layer leveraging
   historical data in FireStore was integrated to optimize the process
   performance, enabling data-driven decision making.

AB This study introduces a modular, end-to-end framework for enhancing
   map-based decision-making. The proposal operates both as a standalone
   pipeline and as a complementary "glue layer" for existing Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS). The framework addresses key limitations in
   GIS, including accessibility, cost, and unconventional data integration
   such as digital map scans and IoT streams. It comprises three core
   phases: (1) automated data acquisition and preparation, leveraging
   advanced techniques to extract geospatial insights from map scans and
   contextual information enrichment with open data and IoT sensors; (2)
   flexible integration with diverse systems (e.g. GIS, or relational data
   warehouses); and (3) interactive map-based visualization enabling
   spatiotemporal analysis via layered meta-visualization. The framework
   aims to visually and functionally enrich maps by integrating embedded
   insights from multimedia data sources, and displaying temporal
   variations and dynamic geographic characteristics on the map. By
   unifying heterogenous data into dynamic, interactive maps, the framework
   reveals hidden spatiotemporal relationships and supports actionable
   insights through intuitive navigation. A proof-of-concept in precision
   agriculture demonstrates the utility of the proposal by integrating
   heterogeneous data-including soil maps, climate records, and real-time
   sensors-to generate actionable crop recommendations. The case study
   highlights the framework's applicability and potential to improve
   decision-making accuracy and efficiency by bridging gaps between complex
   data and diverse user roles, from policymakers to field workers. Beyond
   Agriculture, the modular design enables seamless adaptation across
   domains and roles. By democratizing access to advanced geospatial

AB Digital twins enable Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven decision-making
   in mission-critical infrastructures such as data centers by leveraging
   advanced predictive capabilities. However, deploying predictive digital
   twins in data center presents significant challenges, particularly in
   ensuring real-time updates and reliable dynamic predictions. Existing
   approaches capable of capturing complex system characteristics, ensuring
   predictive accuracy on unseen datasets, and balancing computational
   overhead remain lacking. This paper proposes a dual-level physics-data
   fusion framework that synergistically fuses physics-based and
   data-driven methods. The framework employs system decomposition and
   modular metamodeling to reduce sampling requirements and improve complex
   parameter search efficiency. Experimental validation demonstrates that
   the Coefficient of Variation of the Root-Mean-Square Error (CV-RMSE)
   remains below 15 % for most features, outperforming baseline methods
   where individual feature errors range from 40 % to 100 %. The
   single-time calibration completes within the typical 15-minute sampling
   interval in cooling systems, thereby enabling real-time updates. By
   seamlessly integrating the extrapolation capabilities of physics-based
   models with the adaptability of Machine Learning (ML), the framework
   achieves high predictive accuracy in both interpolation and
   extrapolation tasks. The adaptation process further reduces the Mean
   Absolute Error (MAE) by up to 93 % compared to the Baseline.
   Furthermore, the fusion-based system dynamics model effectively
   simulates multi-stage heat transfer processes, integrating system-level
   thermodynamic interactions with module-level metamodels. This framework
   demonstrates significant potential to enhance digital twin applications,
   optimize data center energy efficiency, and address broader engineering
   challenges.

AB The management of war casualties has evolved significantly. Tactical
   tourniquets, early surgical haemostasis and massive transfusion
   protocols have all contributed to a significant decrease in war
   casualties' mortality. Large scale combat scenarios pose new and major
   challenges, as the volume of casualties is predicted to exceed available
   resources. Combat Medical Early Warning Systems (CMEWS) and wearable
   biosensors could present promising solutions in this context. An Early
   Warning System consists of three key components: data collection of
   vital signs, analysis through an Early Warning Score and a corresponding
   medical response. Biosensors, on the other hand, enable continuous
   monitoring of physiological parameters. Their miniaturisation,
   connectivity and reliability make them promising tools, though
   challenges such as accuracy, cost and data integration remain.
   Integrated CMEWS, combining biosensors with automated decision-making
   algorithms, could revolutionise the management of war casualties. These
   systems would assist in the early identification of severe war
   casualties and triage, assisting health services in casualty flow
   management. They have the potential for providing a shared, real-time
   overview of casualties' status for all healthcare providers.
   Additionally, the integration of these systems into the battlefield
   would facilitate improved coordination across medical and command
   structures, enhancing patient management even in remote or high-risk
   environments. However, the adoption of integrated CMEWS and biosensors
   faces challenges, including data security concerns, infrastructure
   limitations and the need for significant investment and training.
   Despite these hurdles, their potential to enhance casualty care,
   particularly in high-intensity conflict settings, is evident and could
   transform both military and civilian emergency medical care.

AB PurposeThe purpose of this research is to address the formulation and
   manufacturing challenges in pharmaceutical pellet production by
   integrating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The study aims to
   enhance the efficiency and quality of the extrusion-spheronization
   process, ultimately improving the overall production of pharmaceutical
   pellets. MethodsThis research comprised three phases. First, a
   comprehensive review of literature, industry handbooks, and prior
   studies identified key formulation and process variables impacting
   pellet quality in extrusion-spheronization, and gathered data from 158
   pharmaceutical pellets. Second, diverse machine learning models
   (K-Nearest Neighbor, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest,
   XGBoost, deep classifier, and ensemble voting) classified pellet quality
   (high/low) based on a novel composite metric. High accuracy (> 95%)
   achieved by deep learning and XGBoost informed feature importance
   analysis. Explainability techniques (Forward Selection, SHAP, and LIME)
   elucidated the influence of process variables and excipients. Frequent
   pattern mining (FP-Growth) and rule induction revealed significant
   association rules, offering insights into formulation-process
   interactions. Finally, a decision tree was constructed to generate
   actionable process guidelines for real-time decision support. ResultsThe
   models like random forest, XGBoost and specialy deep learning
   demonstrated higher performance with accuracy exceeding 95% and
   F-measures above 97%. SHAP and LIME explanations identified critical
   process parameters-including extrusion speed, spheronization speed, and
   drying temperature-that significantly influence quality outcomes.
   Additionally, frequent pattern mining uncovered key association rules,
   which, along with decision tree models achieving approximately 88.47%
   accuracy, formed the basis for a practical production guideline
   integrated into an operational dashboard. The framework effectively
   supports real-time decision-making, quality control, and process
   optimization, with promising potential for further enhancement through
   larger, real-time datasets. ConclusionThis study underscores the
   effectiveness of integrating machine learning, explainability
   techniques, and data mining to optimize pharmaceutical pellet
   manufacturing. The high-performing models and derived process rules
   offer a robust foundation for improving quality consistency and
   operational efficiency. The approach facilitates accessible, data-driven
   decision support, fostering continuous process improvement, with future
   prospects involving real-time data integration to further elevate
   predictive accuracy and manufacturing resilience.

   and the effective use of green energy have become key issues. This study
   aims to explore a smart city spatial simulation method based on
   multi-dimensional sensing technology and green energy intelligent
   decision support to improve urban operation efficiency and resource
   utilization. In this paper, multidimensional sensing technology is used
   to monitor the data of urban environment, energy consumption and traffic
   flow in real time, and through data fusion and analysis, urban dynamic
   model is established. Based on this model, a green energy intelligent
   decision support system is developed, which can evaluate the cost and
   benefit of various types of renewable energy in real time, and provide
   reliable information support for city managers. The results show that
   the proposed system can significantly improve the utilization rate of
   green energy, optimize energy allocation, and reduce urban carbon
   emissions. Through simulation analysis, the effect of decision support
   in different scenarios is verified, which provides an empirical basis
   for the planning and construction of smart cities. The combination of

AB Discovering novel materials with desired properties is essential for
   driving innovation across industries. Industry 4.0 and smart
   manufacturing have promised transformative advances in this area through
   real-time data integration and automated production planning and
   control. However, the reliance on automation alone has often fallen
   short, lacking the flexibility and innovation needed for this complex
   process. Automation, constrained by predefined processes, is unable to
   adapt to real-time changes. To fully unlock the potential of smart
   manufacturing, we must evolve from automation to autonomous systems that
   go beyond rigid programming and can dynamically adjust and optimize the
   search for solutions in real time. Current discovery approaches are
   often slow, requiring numerous trials to find optimal combinations, and
   costly, particularly when optimizing multiple properties simultaneously.
   To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Bayesian
   multi-objective sequential decision-making (BMSDM) framework that can
   intelligently select experiments as manufacturing progresses, guiding us
   toward the discovery of optimal design faster and more efficiently. The
   framework leverages sequential learning through a Bayesian Optimization
   (BO) framework, which iteratively refines a statistical model
   representing the underlying manufacturing process. This statistical
   model, a Gaussian Process (GP), acts as a surrogate, allowing for
   efficient exploration and optimization without requiring numerous
   real-world experiments. This approach has the potential to significantly
   reduce the time and cost of data collection required by traditional
   experimental designs. To prove our hypothesis, the proposed BMSDM is
   compared with traditional Design of Experiments (DoE) methods and two
   state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization methods. Using a real
   manufacturing dataset, we evaluate and compare the performance of these
   approaches across five key evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate
   that BMSDM comprehensively outperforms the competing methods in
   multi-objective decision-making (MODM) scenarios. Our proposed approach
   represents a significant leap forward in creating a futuristic
   intelligent autonomous platform capable of novel material discovery,
   moving from rigid automation to adaptive, autonomous systems.

   problems. This pipeline is designed to ensure the accuracy and
   reliability of smart building data in a fast and responsive manner,
   using computationally lightweight statistical approaches for outlier
   detection and LightGBM for data imputation. Both methods are optimized
   for low computational cost, making them ideal for real-world scenarios
   requiring immediate feedback and capable of handling very large datasets
   efficiently. Our system is designed to operate automatically, capable of
   applying real-time data processing and periodic model updates without
   manual intervention. It was evaluated using Key Performance Indicators
   over nine weeks across five smart buildings in the EU, revealing
   discrepancies in performance across different time periods and
   buildings. These findings highlight the need for tailored data healing
   strategies for varying dataset sizes, ultimately enhancing data quality
   for more reliable analyses and informed decision-making. The
   implementation of this pipeline contributes to more accurate energy
   usage, improved occupant comfort, and more efficient building
   operations, supporting the broader goals of sustainability and energy
   efficiency in smart buildings.

AB The growth of IoT networks necessitates robust and adaptive trust
   management (TM) systems to ensure secure and reliable interactions
   between devices. This paper introduces a novel TM framework for IoT
   devices, leveraging a statistical Markov chain model to calculate
   dynamic trust scores. Our approach integrates a Multi-Attribute
   Decision-Making (MADM) methodology to rank devices based on
   trustworthiness, providing a resource-efficient alternative to machine
   learning (ML)-based models. In contrast to ML approaches, which often
   require extensive data and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, our
   statistical model provides a resilient and computationally efficient
   solution suitable for environments with limited data availability. The
   system architecture combines a Trust Management Server (TMS), an
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Distributed Ledger Technology
   (DLT) to secure data integrity and enable real-time trust assessment.
   Performance evaluations confirm the model's capacity to manage diverse
   security threats within IoT ecosystems, while future work will focus on
   enhancing the system's adaptability to novel threats, such as zero-day
   attacks, and exploring alternative decision-making models to improve
   resilience under uncertainty. This TM approach advances IoT network
   security by offering a scalable, lightweight solution adaptable to
   varied IoT environments.

AB Modern autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems face
   critical challenges in managing real-time data processing, network
   latency, and security threats across distributed vehicular environments.
   Conventional cloud-centric architectures typically struggle to meet the
   low-latency and high-reliability requirements of vehicle-to-everything
   (V2X) applications, particularly in dynamic and resource-constrained
   edge environments. To address these challenges, this study introduces
   the V2X-Car Edge Cloud system, which is a cloud-native architecture
   driven by DevSecOps principles to ensure secure deployment, dynamic
   resource orchestration, and real-time monitoring across distributed edge
   nodes. The proposed system integrates multicluster orchestration with
   Kubernetes, hybrid communication protocols (C-V2X, 5G, and WAVE), and
   data-fusion pipelines to enhance transparency in artificial intelligence
   (AI)-driven decision making. A software-in-the-loop simulation
   environment was implemented to validate AI models, and the SmartX
   MultiSec framework was integrated into the proposed system to
   dynamically monitor network traffic flow and security. Experimental
   evaluations in a virtual driving environment demonstrate the ability of
   the proposed system to perform automated security updates, continuous
   performance monitoring, and dynamic resource allocation without manual
   intervention.

AB The increasing adoption of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices is
   revolutionizing healthcare, facilitating enhanced remote patient
   monitoring and data-driven clinical decision-making. However, a
   significant challenge remains: the fragmentation of sensitive medical
   data across diverse healthcare infrastructures. This separation of
   medical data seriously hinders seamless data exchange and
   interoperability, preventing healthcare providers from obtaining a
   comprehensive understanding of patient health and limiting the scope of
   data-driven research for improved treatments. To address this critical
   issue, we have developed a novel blockchain-based framework carefully
   designed to unify separate IoMT data sources within a secure platform.
   This framework aims to enhance data accessibility, ensure robust data
   security and patient privacy, and significantly improve the depth of
   clinical understanding, ultimately leading to enhanced patient care. Our
   system employs Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain
   architecture, selected for its security, scalability, and suitability
   for handling sensitive healthcare data. We further integrate edge
   computing principles to optimize data processing efficiency and reduce
   network latency, establishing a decentralized architecture that
   prioritizes data integrity and confidentiality. This innovative approach
   to IoMT data integration aims to enable secure, real-time data sharing
   and improve interoperability across diverse healthcare ecosystems. By
   facilitating seamless data flow and establishing a trustworthy and
   auditable data infrastructure, our framework supports enhanced clinical
   decision-making in crucial areas such as remote patient monitoring,
   chronic disease management, and preventative care. Rigorous performance
   evaluations demonstrate the potential of our framework to transform
   healthcare workflows, improve operational efficiency, and maximize the
   utility of IoMT data for improved healthcare delivery and
   patient-centric models of care. This research represents a significant
   step toward realizing more interconnected, secure, and efficient
   healthcare systems for the future.

AB Autonomous edge computing in robotics, smart cities, and autonomous
   vehicles relies on the seamless integration of sensing, processing, and
   actuation for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. At its
   core is the sensing-to-action loop, which iteratively aligns sensor
   inputs with computational models to drive adaptive control strategies.
   These loops can adapt to hyper-local conditions, enhancing resource
   efficiency and responsiveness, but also face challenges such as resource
   constraints, synchronization delays in multi-modal data fusion, and the
   risk of cascading errors in feedback loops. This article explores how
   proactive, context-aware sensing-to-action and action-to-sensing
   adaptations can enhance efficiency by dynamically adjusting sensing and
   computation based on task demands, such as sensing a very limited part
   of the environment and predicting the rest. By guiding sensing through
   control actions, action-to-sensing pathways can improve task relevance
   and resource use, but they also require robust monitoring to prevent
   cascading errors and maintain reliability. Multi-agent sensing-action
   loops further extend these capabilities through coordinated sensing and
   actions across distributed agents, optimizing resource use via
   collaboration. Additionally, neuromorphic computing, inspired by
   biological systems, provides an efficient framework for spike-based,
   event-driven processing that conserves energy, reduces latency, and
   supports hierarchical control-making it ideal for multi-agent
   optimization. This article highlights the importance of end-to-end
   co-design strategies that align algorithmic models with hardware and
   environmental dynamics, improve cross-layer interdependencies to improve
   throughput, precision, and adaptability for energy-efficient edge
   autonomy in complex environments.

AB An essential aspect of pavement construction sustainability is its
   low-energy consumption and emissions. The study of pavement materials
   workability tests holds significant importance in terms of achieving
   well-mixed conditions with low-energy consumption. The complex
   components of the material and the uncertain kinematic behaviours of
   aggregates during mixing make this process challenging. And, few studies
   of the signal response of pavement materials have been found in the
   field of civil engineering. For this purpose, an accurate evaluation and
   monitoring approach for mixing are needed. In this paper, a wireless
   real-time sensing method is used to monitor the dynamic behaviour of
   aggregates during mixing. A 3D digital twin model, combining
   data-sensing techniques and numerical simulation, has been proposed for
   rapid identification of the mixing material. This model has been
   validated via a data-fusion algorithm. The application of this model
   makes a contribution to the data-intensive analysing jobs and
   decision-making tasks in pavement construction engineering.

AB Sustainable agriculture is the most important factor deciding future of
   the mankind and entire life on the planet. Effective exploration of
   available information/data is widely recognised as a promising approach
   to bring sustainability in agriculture. Therefore, the integration of
   big data into agriculture has generated significant interest worldwide.
   However, the big data concept is not yet well perceived by the
   agriculture community due to the complexity and unfamiliar terminology
   being used in this relatively new field. "How much big" data should be
   considered as big data is one of the most common question being asked by
   the students and researchers from life science including agriculture.
   Big data is not just about the volume of the data but also deals with
   Velocity, Variety, and Veracity, commonly recognised as 4Vs. This
   commentary discusses these aspects, examining how large-scale data
   (Volume) and real-time data streams (Velocity) can be explored for
   better decision-making. It also deals with the challenges of integrating
   diverse data types (Variety) to data accuracy (Veracity) for reliable
   outcomes. In addition to the 4Vs, the commentary highlighted the
   importance of the 4Is i.e. information, integration, innovation, and
   impact which are deciding factor for prediction, precision,
   personalization, and performance (4Ps) of big data approach.
   Understanding of these 4 VIPs will be helpful in the efficient
   exploration of big data approach in sustainable agricultural research.

AB Data visualisation is broadly utilised to aid in presenting complex
   information, facilitating decision-making, and enhancing operational
   efficiency in the mining sector. However, due to the extensive
   utilisation of CAD files and the complexity and difficulty of converting
   2D drawings into 3D models, it is challenging to realise (near)
   real-time 3D data visualisation in mining applications. The difficulties
   are including site drawing complexity, lack of standardisation,
   time-consuming cleaning, and imperative manual intervention. This paper
   addresses these challenges by focusing on an automatic, data-driven
   approach for 3D visual model development in mining, with an emphasis on
   lifetime support and sustainability. Therefore, we introduce
   standardised visual model data diagram and proposed conversion workflows
   to leverage digitised 2D drawings in automatic 3D visual model
   development. Moreover, to improve visualisation efficiency and
   facilitate visual analytics construction in mining, this paper also
   proposes a 3D tile index methodology for efficient visual model
   reconstruction and generic production data integration. To ensure
   lifetime support and sustainable development in visualisation, we
   propose two model expansion schemes: one based on dxf file-driven model
   development, and the other one is interaction-oriented 3D model design
   and development, which the two schemes share the same data exchange and
   conversion workflows. Furthermore, to facilitate data fusion among
   various datasets, we also provide insights into revealing
   spatial-temporal patterns among multimodality data by real-time
   visualisation. These advancements aim to propel the field of underground
   mining visualisation, offering significant insights into enhancing the
   efficiency and safety of mining operations.

   healthcare and costs of healthcare services require efficient health
   systems with integrated care via a command centre that ensures a
   centralised and coordinated approach to exercise effective
   leadership.Description We present a case study using the conceptual
   framework of Franklin to describe the novel system-based engineering
   approach of the Saudi National Health Command Centre (NHCC) including
   its features and outcomes measured.Discussion The NHCC is structured
   into four departments and four zones with real-time data integration and
   visualisation on 88 dashboards. To empower leadership, it harnesses
   artificial intelligence affordances such as machine learning algorithms
   to enhance functionality, decision-making processes and overall
   performance. This allows for the rapid assessment of available resources
   and to monitor healthcare system efficiency at diverse levels of
   clinical and system indicators. Enhanced proactive capacity management
   has contributed to reducing lengths of stay, average supply chain lead
   time and surgery waiting list; early bending of the COVID-19 curve
   resulting in a low mortality rate; increasing bed capacity; deploying
   medical staff and mechanical ventilators rapidly; rolling out the
   COVID-19 vaccination programme and improving patient
   satisfaction.Conclusion Integrating a healthcare system with a command
   centre provides healthcare leaders with the necessary infrastructure to
   create synergy between people, processes and technologies. This
   substantially improves both patient and service outcomes. It also allows
   for immediate care coordination and resource allocations and safeguards
   ease of access to care.

   spatial and temporal domain denoising techniques, the framework
   effectively removes noise while preserving crucial details. The
   inclusion of advanced blending algorithms facilitates seamless fusion of
   data from multiple sources, enhancing decision-making in real-world
   scenarios. The framework adopts a dynamic weighted averaging approach
   and an optimal sensor selection mechanism to intelligently choose
   informative data sources, improving blended output quality. Extensive
   experiments with a diverse IoRT dataset showcase the framework's
   superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, offering significant
   enhancements in video quality, noise reduction, and data fusion

   decision-making via an interactive interface displaying edge-level
   information; and (4) a community-driven feedback mechanism that
   continuously refines recommendations. We have implemented Routify as an
   open-source platform, facilitating further research and development.
   Experimental results from 1000 origin-destination pairs demonstrate
   significant improvements in user-defined environmental metrics (up to
   32.98% increase in green index for walking and 16.91% reduction in noise
   levels for cycling) compared to traditional routing systems. These
   improvements come with slight trade-offs in distance, especially in
   walking mode. Our research contributes a comprehensive framework for
   multi-criteria route recommendation, balancing individual preferences,
   environmental factors, and community insights in urban navigation.

AB In human-robot collaboration (HRC) settings, hand motion intention
   prediction (HMIP) plays a pivotal role in ensuring prompt
   decision-making, safety, and an intuitive collaboration experience.
   Precise and robust HMIP with low computational resources remains a
   challenge due to the stochastic nature of hand motion and the diversity
   of HRC tasks. This paper proposes a framework that combines hand
   trajectories and gaze data to foster robust, real-time HMIP with minimal
   to no training. A novel 3D vector field method is introduced for hand
   trajectory representation, leveraging minimum jerk trajectory
   predictions to discern potential hand motion endpoints. This is
   statistically combined with gaze fixation data using a weighted Naive
   Bayes Classifier (NBC). Acknowledging the potential variances in
   saccadic eye motion due to factors like fatigue or inattentiveness, we
   incorporate stationary gaze entropy to gauge visual concentration,
   thereby adjusting the contribution of gaze fixation to the HMIP.
   Empirical experiments substantiate that the proposed framework robustly
   predicts intended endpoints of hand motion before at least 50% of the
   trajectory is completed. It also successfully exploits gaze fixations
   when the human operator is attentive and mitigates its influence when
   the operator loses focus. A real-time implementation in a construction
   HRC scenario (collaborative tiling) showcases the intuitive nature and
   potential efficiency gains to be leveraged by introducing the proposed
   HMIP into HRC contexts. The open-source implementation of the framework
   is made available at https://github.com/maleenj/hmip_ros.git.

AB The deepening process of urbanization poses formidable challenges to the
   current transportation carrying capacity. The utilization of near-ground
   space (NGS) and urban air mobility (UAM) greatly enhance spatial
   dimensions and traffic flexibility of the transportation system.
   However, the current limited sensing capability falls short in meeting
   the real-time collaborative environmental sensing and intelligent
   control requirements of aerial transportation. Integrated sensing and
   communication (ISAC) combines the sensing system of UAM with 6G
   communication technologies, enabling them to collaborate and achieve
   data sensing, transmission, processing, and decision control. The use of
   artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) facilitates real-time
   data fusion and decision-making, adapting to dynamic and unpredictable
   environments. In this paper, we first model and analyze the traffic flow
   in three-dimensional space, achieving knowledge embedding based on
   artificial potential energy field theory. Next, we design a multimodal
   data fusion neural network structure, which utilizes the Variational
   Autoencoder (VAE) to generatively achieve feature fusion and
   compression. Finally, we construct a UAM digital simulation platform
   using AirSim, which generates considerable aerial data. The simulation
   results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a feature
   recognition accuracy of 90.38%. The total latency is below 0.6ms, which
   exhibits high real-time performance.

AB Web service composition is crucial for creating valuable services by
   integrating pre-existing ones. With their service- oriented architecture
   (SOA), which can be used for any system design, web services can
   increase flexibility. Fusing Web services architecture with Semantic Web
   services can better assist supply chain coordination in a distributive,
   autonomous, and ever-changing corporate environment than current
   information technology. Decisions must be made quickly and with enough
   information many systems fail to provide real-time supply chain insight.
   Forecasting, inventory management, and decision-making may all be
   impacted by poor data quality. Modifying preexisting systems according
   to unique organizational needs may be challenging and expensive. Hence,
   this paper proposes a semantic web service-based supply chain management
   framework (SWS-SCMF) to analyze the web services in supply chains and
   examine how they interact using Web Ontology Language (OWL)-S, including
   automated discovery, construction, and invocation. The suggested method
   for improving supply chain data integration uses an ontology-based
   multiple-agent decision support system. Different accessibility tools,
   data formats, management information systems, semantic web, and
   databases are integrated across the five interconnected levels of the
   system. Businesses may find the proposed approach useful for data and
   information sharing when dealing with complex supply chain management.
   The suggested SWS-SCMF is an adaptable, accurate, and effective method
   for bidirectional chaining composition that uses mediators to enable the
   automated composition of Semantic Web services. The numerical results
   show that our proposed method enhances the overall performance ratio by
   94%, accuracy ratio by 98%, and supply chain management ratio by 91%
   compared to other methods.

AB Coastal protection structures are crucial for safeguarding coastal
   communities from natural disasters, such as coastal erosion and
   flooding. However, due to various factors, such as cyclones, and floods,
   these structures can be damaged, leaving the population living in their
   vicinity at risk. This study pivots from a general evaluation to a
   refined methodological approach, centered on the Kollam district, to
   assess and prioritize vulnerable coastal stretches. We employed a
   comprehensive GIS-based framework, synthesizing data on demographics,
   coastal structures integrity, and shoreline dynamics. The analysis
   meticulously delineated the extent of coastal stretches with damaged
   structures, the populace within the proximity, and the corresponding
   shoreline status. The results unveiled critical zones, such as Alappad
   village, characterized by pronounced structural damage, eroding
   shoreline, and substantial resident populations within proximity. By
   identifying such high- risk areas, the research facilitates strategic
   prioritization for mitigation measures and astute resource allocation.
   Furthermore, the study underlines the pivotal role of continuous
   monitoring, timely interventions, and data-driven decision-making in
   managing coastal areas. While the research presents significant
   insights, it acknowledges inherent limitations tied to data accuracy and
   its dynamism. Future work should pivot towards real-time data
   integration, encompassing broader factors like climate projections and
   socio-economic determinants, thereby enhancing the robustness and
   applicability of our risk assessment model for global coastal
   management.

   management, particularly in the risk identification, analysis,
   evaluation, and mitigation phases. This study is a systematic literature
   review of recent developments in DT technology, focusing on its
   practical functions and methods for effective safety risk management.
   The advantages of DT models include flexibility and simulation
   capabilities, which are helpful in conducting analyses and simulations
   in all four phases of safety risk management. However, despite DTs'
   functionality and simulation capability in the safety risk field,
   challenges remain. Unresolved issues in practical use include a lack of
   standardization, data integration problems, and the need for advanced
   simulation tools. These problems should be addressed to enhance response
   accuracy to dangerous events and improve decision-making processes. This

AB Buildings' energy efficiency is a widely researched topic, which is
   rapidly gaining popularity due to rising environmental concerns and the
   need for energy independence. In Northern Europe heating energy alone
   accounts for up to 70% of the total building energy consumption.
   Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT, big data, cloud computing and
   machine learning, along with the creation of predictive and proactive
   digital twins, can help to reduce this number. However, buildings'
   thermal dynamics is a very complex process that depends on many
   variables. As a result, commonly used physics-based white box models are
   time-consuming and require vast expertise. On the contrary, black box
   forecasting models, which rely primarily on building energy consumption
   data, lack fundamental insights and hinder re-use. In this study we
   propose an architecture to facilitate grey box modeling of building's
   thermal dynamics while integrating real time IoT data with 3D
   representation of buildings. The architecture is validated in a case
   study creating a digital twin platform that enables users to define the
   thermal dynamics of buildings based on physical laws and real data, thus
   facilitating informed decision making for the best heating energy
   optimization strategy. Also, the created user interface enables
   stakeholders such as facility managers, energy providers or governing
   bodies to analyze, compare and evaluate buildings' thermal dynamics
   without extensive expertise or time resources.

AB Timely and reliable information is critical to organizations managing
   water resources. Drinking water is one main source of risk when its
   safety and security is not ensured. Early prediction and mitigation of
   such risks relies on prediction models that depend on live and
   historical data. Such data are quite heterogenous in nature, including
   sensor measurements, satellite imagery and radar readings, unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) images and videos as well as results of prediction
   algorithms (flood risk, oil spills etc). AQUA3S is an EU funded project
   which combines novel technologies in water safety and security, aiming
   to standardize existing sensor technologies complemented by
   state-of-the-art detection mechanisms. Sensor networks are deployed in
   water supply networks and sources, supported by complex sensors for
   enhanced detection. Sensor measurements are supported by videos from
   UAVs, satellite images and social media observations from the citizens
   that report low-quality water in their area also creating social
   awareness and an interactive knowledge transfer. Semantic representation
   and data fusion provides intelligent decision support system (DSS)
   alerts and messages to the public through first responders' mediums.
   This study presents the data ingestion, integration and harmonization
   platform that was developed to support the systems of the project,
   consisting of the necessary APIs, to ingest data, a harmonization layer
   and a data store layer The data is harmonized and indexed using the
   NGSI-LD model to make sure information can be indexed and served both is
   real time through a live context broker, as well as in the form of
   historical time series through a dedicated historical data service. The
   data store layer includes provisions for the storage of annotated binary
   files (images, videos, etc.) as well as georeferenced map layers
   following OGC protocols such as web feature service (WFS), web map
   service (WMS), and web coverage service (WCS).

AB Industry 4.0 is envisioned to transform the entire economical ecosystem
   by the inclusion of new paradigms, such as cyber-physical systems or
   artificial intelligence, into the production systems and solutions. One
   of the main benefits of this revolution is the increase in the
   production systems' efficiency, thanks to real-time algorithms and
   automatic decision-making mechanisms. However, at the software level,
   these innovative algorithms are very sensitive to the quality of
   received data. Common malfunctions in sensor nodes, such as delays,
   numerical errors, corrupted data or inactivity periods, may cause a
   critical problem if an inadequate decision is made based on those data.
   Many systems remove this risk by seamlessly integrating the sensor nodes
   and the high-level components, but this situation substantially reduces
   the impact of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and increases its deployment
   cost. Therefore, new solutions that guarantee the interoperability of
   all sensors with the software elements in Industry 4.0 solutions are
   needed. In this paper, we propose a solution based on numerical
   algorithms following a predictor-corrector architecture. Using a
   combination of techniques, such as Lagrange polynomial and Hermite
   interpolation, data series may be adapted to the requirements of
   Industry 4.0 software algorithms. Series may be expanded, contracted or
   completed using predicted samples, which are later updated and corrected
   using the real information (if received). Results show the proposed
   solution works in real time, increases the quality of data series in a
   relevant way and reduces the error probability in Industry 4.0 systems.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasing role in the
   logistical aspects of a production site in an automotive industry. The
   pre-calculation of critical situations in the delivery of parts to the
   supplier network faces increasing disruptions which have an impact on
   delivery reliability. The planning and control processes are currently
   implemented by employees and consequently causes a lot of effort and
   sometimes incorrect decisions which are mostly based on the experiences
   of employees. The processing and learning AI component will assess the
   disruption risk caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes,
   hurricanes or through manmade political or social actions such as
   strikes and propose countermeasures and assure material availability.
   Automatic and permanent screening of external sources (newsfeed, weather
   forecast, traffic situation) determine potential influence of road
   conditions, natural disasters, strikes etc. on the expected reliability
   of material replenishment. Finally, the processing and learning
   component will assess different countermeasures based on a machine
   learning algorithm, which will be feed with data collected from the
   sensing component.

AB Advancements in Cloud-native services, Machine-Learning (ML), Artificial
   Intelligence (AI), and Rapid Application Development (RAD) using the
   Agile methodology has led countless industries to achieving desirable
   levels of automation while reducing cost and improving quality software
   deployments, timely / iterative delivery, and accountability. Coupling
   this framework with the principle of security as a shared responsibility
   further enhances the efficacy of an integrated Development, Security,
   and Operations (DevSecOps) Team within organizations to deliver secured
   digital solutions. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the
   world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution
   shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application
   framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as
   capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM
   automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety
   critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and
   mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved
   through multiyear, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has
   proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow
   for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data
   integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates
   significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of
   the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts-in terms
   of new capabilities-in constant investment decision planning cycles,
   costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance
   aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging
   collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs
   must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver
   critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to
   air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so
   can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing
   the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an
   opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time
   and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging
   cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this
   automation evolution vision for ANSPs.
   This paper examines the migration from today's systems to secure,
   cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission
   Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who
   provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured
   cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical
   decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in
   Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets
   into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the
   solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics
   and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand
   capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace
   delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission
   objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in
   cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations,
   like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for
   that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the
   use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM
   platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that
   must be considered for this evolution.

AB Smart manufacturing, which integrates a multi-sensing system with
   physical manufacturing processes, has been widely adopted in the
   industry to support online and real-time decision making to improve
   manufacturing quality. A multi-sensing system for each specific
   manufacturing process can efficiently collect the in situ process
   variables from different sensor modalities to reflect the process
   variations in real-time. However, in practice, we usually do not have
   enough budget to equip too many sensors in each manufacturing process
   due to the cost consideration. Moreover, it is also important to better
   interpret the relationship between the sensing modalities and the
   quality variables based on the model. Therefore, it is necessary to
   model the quality-process relationship by selecting the most relevant
   sensor modalities with the specific quality measurement from the
   multi-modal sensing system in smart manufacturing. In this research, we
   adopted the concept of best subset variable selection and proposed a new
   model called Multi-mOdal beSt Subset modeling (MOSS). The proposed MOSS
   can effectively select the important sensor modalities and improve the
   modeling accuracy in quality-process modeling via functional norms that
   characterize the overall effects of individual modalities. The
   significance of sensor modalities can be used to determine the sensor
   placement strategy in smart manufacturing. Moreover, the selected
   modalities can better interpret the quality-process model by identifying
   the most correlated root cause of quality variations. The merits of the
   proposed model are illustrated by both simulations and a real case study
   in an additive manufacturing (i.e., fused deposition modeling) process.

AB Unmanned Systems (UxVs) are becoming increasingly prevalent across both
   the Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial sectors. As automation
   becomes increasingly robust and systems transition from being merely
   automated to being more autonomous, there is a need for Human Machine
   Interfaces (HMI) to enable effective supervisory control of these
   systems. An ontology-driven decision support system has been designed to
   emulate Recognition-Primed Decision Making (RPD) that is exhibited in
   experts. This RPD Agent (RPDA) fuses real-time sensor data and vehicle
   telemetry with static rulesets based on tacit domain knowledge elicited
   from experts to generate Courses of Action (COA) that a user can pick
   from. By querying ontologies of human expert knowledge, real-time world
   states can be rapidly compared to instantiated rulesets to provide
   relatively novice users with extended domain expertise. By presenting
   the operator with a list of logically permissible COAs rather than
   generating the COAs themselves, one can employ effective supervisory
   control over multi-domain, multi-mission autonomy. This paper discusses
   the conceptual and functional design of the RPDA, the development of
   component domain ontologies to power the agent, conclusions, and future
   work to be performed.

AB Big Data received from sources such as social media, in-stream
   monitoring systems, networks, and markets is often mined for discovering
   patterns, detecting anomalies, and making decisions or predictions. In
   distributed learning and real-time processing of Big Data,
   ensemble-based systems in which a fusion center (FC) is used to combine
   the local decisions of several classifiers, have shown to be superior to
   single expert systems. However, optimal design of the FC requires
   knowledge of the accuracy of the individual classifiers which, in many
   cases, is not available. Moreover, in many applications supervised
   training of the FC is not feasible since the true labels of the data set
   are not available. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised joint
   estimation-detection scheme to estimate the accuracies of the local
   classifiers as functions of data context and to fuse the local decisions
   of the classifiers. Numerical results show the dramatic improvement of
   the proposed method as compared with the state of the art approaches.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping thoracic surgery,
   advancing from decision support to the threshold of autonomous
   intervention. AI-driven technologies-including machine learning (ML),
   deep learning (DL), and computer vision-have demonstrated significant
   improvements in diagnostic accuracy, surgical planning, intraoperative
   navigation, and postoperative outcome prediction. In lung cancer and
   thoracic oncology, AI enhances imaging analysis, histopathological
   classification, and risk stratification, supporting multidisciplinary
   decision-making and personalized therapy. Robotic-assisted and AI-guided
   systems are optimizing surgical precision and workflow efficiency, while
   real-time decision-support tools and augmented reality are improving
   intraoperative safety. Despite these advances, widespread adoption is
   limited by challenges in algorithmic bias, data integration, regulatory
   approval, and ethical transparency. The literature emphasizes the need
   for multicenter validation, explainable AI, and robust governance
   frameworks to ensure safe and effective clinical integration. Future
   research should focus on digital twin technology, federated learning,
   and transparent AI outputs to further enhance reliability and
   accessibility. AI is poised to transform thoracic surgery, but
   responsible implementation and ongoing evaluation are essential for
   realizing its full potential. The aim of this review is to evaluate and
   synthesize the current landscape of artificial intelligence (AI)
   applications across the thoracic surgical pathway, from preoperative
   decision-support to intraoperative guidance and emerging autonomous

AB Personalized medicine for gastric cancer continues to face numerous
   challenges, primarily due to the complexity of clinical decision making
   and the difficulty of integrating multimodal data. Artificial
   intelligence (AI), with its powerful capabilities in feature learning
   and pattern recognition, is emerging as a key technology to overcome
   these barriers. It provides critical support in areas such as early
   screening, histological subtyping, prediction of treatment response, and
   prognostic risk stratification. This review examines the application of
   AI in diagnosing and treating gastric cancer, with particular attention
   to the current mainstream AI methodologies, including feature
   engineering and deep learning and the rapidly evolving pretrained
   foundation models and multimodal large models. With the integration of
   medical images, digital pathology, multiomics data, and structured
   clinical information, AI systems are increasingly effective at capturing
   tumor heterogeneity and supporting complex clinical decisions in real
   time. On the one hand, task-specific models have demonstrated excellent
   performance in subtyping, staging, and prognosis assessment. On the
   other hand, the rise of foundation models and general-purpose large
   models is redefining the limits of AI in cross-task transfer, complex
   reasoning, and human-machine interaction. These technologies hold
   promise in addressing key obstacles such as data scarcity, modality
   heterogeneity, and fragmented clinical workflows, offering a feasible
   path toward a unified and efficient AI-driven diagnostic and therapeutic
   system for gastric cancer. As technological maturity progresses
   alongside the development of robust safety and ethical frameworks, AI is
   expected to evolve from a static auxiliary interpretation tool into an
   intelligent decision-making platform capable of semantic understanding,
   dynamic feedback, and multidisciplinary collaboration-therefore playing
   a pivotal role across the full spectrum of precision medicine in gastric
   cancer.

AB Background: Multimodal artificial intelligence (MMAI) is transforming
   urological oncology by enabling the seamless integration of diverse data
   sources, including imaging, clinical records and robotic telemetry to
   facilitate patient-specific decision-making. Methods: This narrative
   review summarizes the current developments, applications, opportunities
   and risks of multimodal AI systems throughout the entire perioperative
   process in uro-oncologic surgery. Results: MMAI demonstrates
   quantifiable benefits across the entire perioperative pathway.
   Preoperatively, it improves diagnostics and surgical planning via
   multimodal data fusion. Intraoperatively, AI-assisted systems provide
   real-time context-based decision support, risk prediction and skill
   assessment within the operating theater. Postoperatively, MMAI
   facilitates automated documentation, early complication detection and
   personalized follow-up. Generative AI further revolutionizes surgical
   training through adaptive feedback and simulations. However, critical
   limitations must be addressed, including data bias, the barrier of
   closed robotic platforms, insufficient model validation, data security
   issues, hallucinations and ethical concerns regarding liability and
   transparency. Conclusions: MMAI significantly enhances the precision,
   efficiency and patient-centeredness of uro-oncological care. To ensure
   safe and widespread implementation, resolving the technical and
   regulatory barriers to real-time integration into robotic platforms is
   paramount. This must be coupled with standardized quality controls,
   transparent decision-making processes and responsible integration that
   fully preserves physician autonomy.

AB Under the dual pressures of climate change and rapid urbanization, the
   frequent occurrence of flood disasters has become a global challenge.
   The widespread use of social media provides new perspectives for broader
   and more comprehensive perception of flood disaster events, and a social
   media-enabled flood disaster informatics framework has gradually taken
   shape. This study systematically reviews 607 publications from 2004 to
   2024, aiming to reveal the research progress of utilizing social media
   big data in flood disaster management. By constructing a
   "method-technology-application" full-chain flood disaster informatics
   framework, this study highlights the flood information processing
   workflow featuring social media data, covering multiple aspects
   including social media data analysis, flood event detection, flood
   situation awareness, flood risk mapping, and emergency management
   practices. The literature review indicates that social media has been
   proven effective in compensating for the limitations of traditional
   flood monitoring approaches. In particular, multimodal data fusion and
   the application of artificial intelligence techniques can significantly
   enhance global flood monitoring capabilities. However, current research
   still faces challenges such as verifying data authenticity and
   integrating information across platforms. Future research should focus
   on exploring the transformative applications of foundation models (e.g.,
   large language models, vision foundation models, and multimodal large
   models) with social media, including massive multi-source heterogeneous
   information understanding, generative disaster reporting and decision
   support, as well as real-time prediction and emergency simulation
   incorporating physical mechanisms. These advances are expected to drive
   a profound transformation of the intelligent emergency decision-making
   paradigm and provide a solid theoretical and technical foundation for
   the development of smart flood emergency management systems.

   for practical application, including hybrid platforms, Internet of

   comparative analysis of smell and taste sensing methods, emphasizing
   cases where integrating both modalities enhances sensitivity,
   selectivity, detection limits, and reliability in complex environments
   like food, environmental monitoring, healthcare, and security.
   Ongoing challenges are addressed with emerging solutions such as
   antifouling/self-healing interfaces, modular cartridges, machine

   approaches using scalable microfabrication and sustainable materials.
   The review concludes with a practical roadmap advocating for the joint
   development of receptors, materials, and algorithms; establishment of
   open standards for long-term stability; implementation of
   explainable/edge AI with privacy-focused analytics; and proactive
   collaboration with regulatory bodies. Collectively, these strategies aim
   to advance biomimetic smell and taste biosensors from experimental
   prototypes to dependable, commercially viable tools for continuous
   chemical sensing in real-world applications.

   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, multimachine collaborative
   operations have become the core model for increasing mission
   effectiveness. However, large-scale UAV clusters face challenges such as
   dynamic security threats, heterogeneous data fusion difficulties, and
   resource-constrained decision-making delays. Traditional single-machine
   intelligent architectures have limitations when addressing new threats,
   such as insufficient real-time response capabilities. To address these
   issues, this paper presnts an LLM-layered collaborative security
   architecture (LLM-LCSA) for multimachine collaborative security. This
   architecture optimizes the spatiotemporal fusion efficiency of
   multisource asynchronous data through cloud-edge-end collaborative
   deployment, combining an end lightweight LLM, an edge medium LLM, and a
   cloud-based foundation LLM. Additionally, a Mixture of Experts (MoEs)
   intelligent algorithm that dynamically activates the most relevant
   expert models by leveraging a threat-expert association matrix is
   introduced, thereby increasing the accuracy of complex threat
   identification and dynamic adaptability. Moreover, a resource-aware
   multi-objective optimization model is constructed to generate optimal
   decisions under resource constraints. Simulation results indicate that
   compared with traditional methods, LLM-LCSA achieves an average 7.92%
   improvement in the threat detection accuracy, reduces the system's total
   response time by 44.52%, and enables resource scheduling during off-peak
   periods. This architecture provides an efficient, intelligent, and
   scalable solution for secure collaboration among UAV swarms. Future
   research should further explore its application potential in 6G network
   integration and large-scale swarm environments.

AB The construction sector drives nearly half of global material
   extraction, energy use, emissions, and waste, yet environmental impact
   assessment (EIA) remains a static document, fragmented and disconnected
   from dynamic ecological systems. Here, we propose an upgrade to a
   five-dimensional (5D) EIA framework that integrates space-time analysis
   (3D + time = 4D) with real-time monitoring and impact quantification
   (5D) to account for environmental footprint and prevent irreversible
   impacts. The methodology included an analysis of over 100 EIA permits
   and reports, supplemented by interviews, reviews of technologies and
   process and systems analysis. Central to this approach is the inclusion
   of 4D building information models (BIM) and nature's self-cleansing
   capacity, which is often overlooked in conventional assessments. The
   proposed Integrated Environmental Decision Support Information System
   (I-EDSIS) would enable continuous impact tracking, cumulative effect
   evaluation, and insights into patterns for adaptive mitigation. Drawing
   on a national-scale case study, we show that building permits correlate
   with NOx and PM10 (r = 0.96), while pollutant levels vary by up to 1.5-3
   times across months and within a day, revealing potential for
   time-sensitive adaptive construction and less ecological disruption.
   This perspective argues for reframing EIA as a proactive tool for
   sustainability, transparency, active durability, cross-sectoral data
   integration, and resilience-based development.

AB 'Digital twins', also called 'digital patient twins' or 'virtual human
   twins' - digital patient-specific models derived from multimodal health
   data - are a strong focus in health care and are emerging as a promising
   tool for improving personalized care in uro-oncology. These models can
   integrate clinical, genomic, imaging and histopathological information
   to simulate organ behaviour and disease progress as well as predict
   responses to treatments. The concept of digital twins has shown
   potential in various fields, but its application in uro-oncology is
   still evolving, with few assessments of their feasibility and clinical
   utility. The advent of artificial intelligence adds a new dimension to
   their development, potentially enabling the synthesis of diverse,
   high-quality datasets to improve modelling accuracy and support
   real-time decision-making. However, substantial challenges exist,
   including data integration, patient privacy, computational demands and
   ethical frameworks. In addition, the interpretability of predictions
   remains essential for gaining clinical trust and guiding patient-centred
   decisions. The use of digital twins in uro-oncology has the potential to
   improve patient stratification and treatment planning; however, barriers
   must be overcome for their successful implementation in clinical
   routine. By integrating new technologies, fostering interdisciplinary
   collaboration and prioritizing transparency, digital twins could shape
   the future of precision uro-oncology.

AB Currently, maritime navigation safety risks-particularly those related
   to ship navigation-are primarily assessed through traditional rule-based
   methods and expert experience. However, such approaches often suffer
   from limited accuracy and lack real-time responsiveness. As maritime
   environments and operational conditions become increasingly complex,
   traditional techniques struggle to cope with the diversity and
   uncertainty of navigation scenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need
   for a more intelligent and precise risk prediction method. This study
   proposes a ship risk prediction framework that integrates a deep
   learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with
   Bayesian risk evaluation. The model first leverages deep neural networks
   to process time-series trajectory data, enabling accurate prediction of
   a vessel's future positions and navigational status. Then, Bayesian
   inference is applied to quantitatively assess potential risks of
   collision and grounding by incorporating vessel motion data,
   environmental conditions, surrounding obstacles, and water depth
   information. The proposed framework combines the advantages of deep
   learning and Bayesian reasoning to improve the accuracy and timeliness
   of risk prediction. By providing real-time warnings and decision-making
   support, this model offers a novel solution for maritime safety
   management. Accurate risk forecasts enable ship crews to take
   precautionary measures in advance, effectively reducing the occurrence
   of maritime accidents.

AB Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is a pivotal process in advanced
   semiconductor manufacturing that enables wafer surface planarization.
   CMP endpoint detection (EPD) technology achieves precise control over
   the wafer surface topography and material removal rates by dynamically
   adjusting the polishing pressure in different zones through real-time
   measurements of the thin film thickness. However, current EPD techniques
   face challenges in accurately capturing material removal rate variations
   in localized regions of wafers with complex patterns and nonuniform
   density distributions, leading to discrepancies between the detection
   signals and actual polishing states. Moreover, polishing processes
   involving multi-material systems suffer from limited signal resolution
   and selectivity, making it difficult to precisely detect interface
   changes. Thus, the investigation and optimization of CMP EPD
   technologies are crucial for addressing the challenges posed by
   multi-material and novel structures and improving the precision and
   stability of the process. This paper systematically reviews the current
   research on CMP EPD technologies, focusing on the principles,
   characteristics, and advancements in offline (e.g., the time method) and
   online (e.g., friction-based, optical, and eddy-current techniques)
   detection methods. In the early or stable stages of the CMP processes,
   endpoint control relies predominantly on experience and time-based
   polishing and lacks precise online detection. With technological
   advancements, four-probe offline detection instruments have been
   employed for post-polishing evaluations. However, these methods require
   extensive data accumulation and an understanding of the process
   parameters to determine the optimal polishing time for each material and
   process. Advanced CMP processes involve diverse materials, such as
   shallow trench isolation, interlayer dielectrics (SiO2), metal
   interconnects (Cu), and barrier layers (Ti / TiN), each with distinct
   polishing rates and removal mechanisms. Offline detection methods
   struggle to adapt to these variations in real-time. In addition,
   time-based offline detection fails to account for wafer-to-wafer
   differences, rendering it insufficient to meet the demands of advanced
   CMP processes for real-time monitoring and rapid response. Consequently,
   online detection methods are often required to ensure process stability
   and product quality. Online EPD technologies enable real-time monitoring
   and analysis of polishing conditions during the CMP process, ensuring
   the achievement of the desired endpoints. These technologies are pivotal
   for automating the polishing process and enhancing the integrated
   circuit yield. Friction-based online EPD techniques offer strong
   real-time performance and ease of integration, making them particularly
   suitable for capturing dynamic mechanical interactions during polishing.
   However, these methods are significantly influenced by process
   conditions, such as pad wear and slurry flow, with signal noise and
   external disturbances undermining the detection accuracy and
   reliability. Future advancements in friction-based EPD should include
   the introduction of adaptive calibration mechanisms to mitigate external
   disturbances and the development of high-sensitivity friction sensors to
   explore the nanoscale film removal characteristics and meet the
   requirements of advanced process nodes. Optical EPD techniques typically
   achieve sub-nanome ter resolutions for film thickness measurements.
   However, optical methods are highly sensitive to environmental
   conditions, with polishing slurry, debris, and surface contamination
   potentially interfering with signals and reducing detection precision.
   Future improvements in optical EPD systems should focus on enhancing the
   optical system design to resist interference from slurry, contaminants,
   and environmental fluctuations. Eddy-current EPD provides
   nanometer-level thickness measurements at a relatively low cost and can
   be easily integrated with CMP equipment. However, its insensitivity to
   insulating materials, such as dielectric layers, limits its ability to
   independently detect dielectric and nonmetallic films. Furthermore, the
   development of eddy-current sensors capable of achieving high-precision
   (nano-/ sub-nanometer scale) measurements under large lift-off
   variations remains critical for future research. In the future,
   multi-physics field fusion methods will play a pivotal role in enhancing
   the detection performance to address the challenges posed by multilayer
   film stacks and heterogeneous material systems in 3D devices for
   advanced process nodes. By integrating optical, eddy-current, and
   friction-based techniques with multi-sensor collaborative acquisition
   and data fusion algorithms, the selectivity and accuracy of EPD can be
   significantly improved. Furthermore, AI-driven intelligent signal
   processing equipped with robust feature learning, pattern recognition,
   and intelligent decision-making capabilities enables the analysis and
   prediction of complex three-dimensional structural signals while
   adaptively adjusting the parameters, thereby enhancing the adaptability
   of EPD technologies. Additionally, flexible and customizable sensor
   designs combined with micro-area detection techniques contribute to
   increased spatiotemporal resolution, facilitating the precise monitoring
   and dynamic regulation of localized polishing conditions.

AB Effective occupant-centric indoor environment management requires
   systems capable of integrating human experience with environmental
   conditions in real time. However, existing building systems often fail
   to collect and integrate multidimensional and multivariate occupant
   feedback with environmental data for informed decision-making. This
   limitation stems from gaps in Human-Building Interaction (HBI) systems,
   which are critical for collecting and integrating insights from
   occupants to support adaptive indoor environment management. To address
   these gaps, this paper presents a novel HBI system that combines a
   multidimensional occupant feedback curation User Interface (UI), an
   indoor environmental data collection system focused on thermal
   conditions and indoor air quality, outdoor environmental data
   integration, and deep learningbased predictive modeling to improve
   indoor environment management. The proposed HBI system consists of five
   key components: (1) a feedback curation UI to collect multidimensional
   occupant feedback: ratings of perceived comfort, health, and emotion on
   1-5 Likert scales, (2) smart indoor environmental sensor networks, (3)
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Application
   Programming Interface (API) for outdoor environmental data retrieval,
   (4) a central Structured Query Language (SQL) database for structured
   data management and storage, and (5) a Long short-term memory
   (LSTM)-based predictive model to analyze and model occupant feedback
   trends. A pilot study conducted at the Virginia Tech Blacksburg campus
   validated the system's effectiveness. This study contributes to
   occupant-centric indoor environmental management, addressing gaps in
   multidimensional feedback collection and its holistic integration with
   predictive modeling.

AB Urbanization and traffic congestion caused by the surge in car ownership
   have exacerbated energy consumption and carbon emissions, and dynamic
   traffic flow prediction and energy-saving route planning have become the
   key to solving this problem. Dynamic traffic flow prediction accurately
   captures the spatio-temporal changes of traffic flow through advanced
   algorithms and models, providing prospective information for traffic
   management and travel decision-making. Energy-saving route planning
   optimizes travel routes based on prediction results, reduces the time
   vehicles spend on congested road sections, thereby reducing fuel
   consumption and exhaust emissions. However, there are still many
   shortcomings in the current relevant research, and the existing research
   is mostly isolated and applies a single model, and there is a lack of
   systematic comparison of the adaptability, generalization ability and
   fusion potential of different models in various scenarios, and the
   advantages of heterogeneous graph neural networks in integrating
   multi-source heterogeneous data in traffic have not been brought into
   play. This paper systematically reviews the relevant global studies from
   2020 to 2025, focuses on the integration path of dynamic traffic flow
   prediction methods and energy-saving route planning, and reveals the
   advantages of LSTM, graph neural network and other models in capturing
   spatiotemporal features by combing the application of statistical
   models, machine learning, deep learning and mixed methods in traffic
   forecasting, and comparing their performance with RMSE, MAPE and other
   indicators, and points out that the potential of heterogeneous graph
   neural networks in multi-source heterogeneous data integration has not
   been fully explored. Aiming at the problem of disconnection between
   traffic prediction and path planning, an integrated framework is
   constructed, and the real-time prediction results are integrated into
   path algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra through multi-objective cost
   functions to balance distance, time and energy consumption optimization.
   Finally, the challenges of data quality, algorithm efficiency, and
   multimodal adaptation are analyzed, and the development direction of
   standardized evaluation platform and open source toolkit is proposed,
   providing theoretical support and practical path for the sustainable
   development of intelligent transportation systems.

AB This paper presents a real-time adaptive trajectory prediction framework
   for cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms engaged in dynamic
   target tracking within cluttered environments. The proposed system
   introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based control
   architecture combining fuzzy inference, neuroemotional learning, and
   distributed multi-agent coordination. At the core of the approach is a
   Bidirectional Fuzzy Brain Emotional Learning Prediction (BFBEL-P) model,
   which integrates fuzzy logic and an online adaptive neural structure to
   enable trajectory forecasting without pre-training or prior knowledge of
   the environment. From an engineering perspective, this AI model is
   deployed in UAV swarm navigation, where robust decision-making,
   predictive coordination, and obstacle avoidance are essential for target
   interception missions. In contrast to conventional prediction methods,
   such as curve fitting, nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), and
   deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the BFBEL-P
   framework offers fast convergence, low computational cost, and high
   adaptability. The system incorporates multi-threaded data fusion across
   the swarm to achieve consensus-driven predictions and maintain
   situational awareness, even under sensor failures or occlusions.
   Simulation results show that BFBEL-P improves short-term prediction
   accuracy by 82.2%, reduces prediction time by 15%, and achieves a 100%
   tracking success rate across benchmark scenarios. These results
   establish BFBEL-P as a reliable AI technique for distributed control in
   real-world UAV swarm applications, offering a promising tool for
   search-and-rescue, surveillance, and defense operations.

AB In the field of brain‒computer interfaces (BCIs), developing a reliable
   machine learning (ML) model for real-time robotic hand control systems
   based on motor imagery (MI) brain signals requires substantial research.
   For this purpose, a set of ML models has been developed and tested to
   identify robust models via MI sensor data fusion under both
   nonadversarial and adversarial attack conditions. This paper addresses
   numerous essential areas, including the development of ML models for
   electroencephalography (EEG) MI signal datasets, with a focus on proper
   preprocessing and evaluation under both nonadversarial and adversarial
   attack conditions. Three phases make up the process. In the first phase,
   raw MI-EEG datasets from the Graz University BCI competition are
   identified and preprocessed. The preprocessing encompasses six key
   stages: EEG-MI signal filtering, segmentation, time‒frequency domain
   feature extraction, merging and labeling, normalization (resulting in
   Dataset I), and feature fusion (resulting in Dataset II). In the second
   phase, both datasets are used to develop nine different ML methods and
   are evaluated via nine performance metrics. These models are trained and
   tested against adversarial and nonadversarial scenarios. In the third
   phase, the fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM) and the
   multiperspective decision matrix (MPDM) are combined to benchmark the ML
   models via the fuzzy multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. The
   random forest (RF) model achieved the best overall performance, with the
   lowest FDOSM scores: 0.18241 for Dataset I and 0.21636 for Dataset II. A
   lower FDOSM score means better results across all evaluation criteria.
   To further assess the developed methodology, the RF model was tested on
   Dataset III, comprising EEG data from four participants collected via
   the EMOTIV EPOC. The mean classification accuracy achieved by the RF
   model was 83% with standard preprocessing, and it improved to 86% with
   the application of feature fusion techniques. Additionally, this study
   employed the local interpretability model-agnostic explanation (LIME)
   method to provide an understanding of the RF model's behavior and
   enhance the interpretability of the results in the context of individual
   predictions.

AB Sustainable development (SD) in human settlements (HS) can be achieved
   by integrating intelligent IoT infrastructure and human-machine
   interaction (HMI) into geographic information system (GIS) models. This
   study proposes a method combining real-time (RT) data and automation to
   address gaps in technology and urban planning. Current GIS models are
   ineffective due to limited RT data integration, poor urban system
   interaction, and lack of adaptability to dynamic changes. These
   shortcomings hinder sustainable urban growth, leading to suboptimal
   planning and resource management (RM). The proposed IoT-based framework
   for SD in HS (IoT-SDHS) utilizes IoT devices and sensors to collect RT
   social, economic, and environmental data. This data enables adaptive
   decision-making (DM), smarter city planning, improved RM, and enhanced
   urban resilience. Intuitive HMI interfaces allow stakeholders to work
   effectively with the framework, facilitating data-driven decisions for
   urban planning and sustainability. Outcomes demonstrate significant

AB How to enable autonomous vehicles to sustain high safety and rapid
   response capability in complex, dynamic environments remains a critical
   and urgent challenge. This study aims to elevate the learning efficiency
   of multi-sensor feature fusion in autonomous-driving tasks, thereby
   strengthening system safety and responsiveness. To this end, we present
   an innovative multi-modal, multi-sensor feature-fusion model that
   integrates two highly effective mechanisms (Sparse Channel Pooling and
   Residual Triplet-Attention) to refine the fusion process. First, the
   Sparse Channel Pooling mechanism allows the model to adaptively select
   salient feature channels while suppressing redundant information.
   Second, the Residual Triplet-Attention mechanism resolves inter-modal
   feature misalignment, enabling accurate cross-modal alignment of key
   features and markedly improving computational efficiency. Finally, a
   reinforcement-learning module is introduced to learn and optimize
   policies in continuous action spaces. Coupled with the feature-fusion
   framework, this module enables end-to-end, high-efficiency
   driving-policy learning within the CARLA autonomous-driving simulator.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only
   maintains safe operation in complex dynamic scenarios but also preserves
   real-time, high-level perception and decision-making accuracy, offering
   a novel paradigm for multi-sensor data fusion in autonomous driving.

AB The maritime sector faces escalating demands to minimize emissions and
   optimize operational efficiency under tightening environmental
   regulations. Although technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT),
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Digital Twins (DT) offer substantial
   potential, their deployment in real-time ship performance analytics is
   at an emerging state. This paper proposes a machine learning-driven
   framework for real-time ship performance management. The framework
   starts with data collected from onboard sensors and culminates in a
   decision support system that is easily interpretable, even by
   non-experts. It also provides a method to forecast vessel performance by
   extrapolating Key Performance Indicator (KPI) values. Furthermore, it
   offers a flexible methodology for defining KPIs for every crucial
   component or aspect of vessel performance, illustrated through a use
   case focusing on fuel oil consumption. Leveraging Artificial Neural
   Networks (ANNs), hybrid multivariate data fusion, and high-frequency
   sensor streams, the system facilitates continuous diagnostics, early
   fault detection, and data-driven decision-making. Unlike conventional
   static performance models, the framework employs dynamic KPIs that
   evolve with the vessel's operational state, enabling advanced trend
   analysis, predictive maintenance scheduling, and compliance assurance.
   Experimental comparison against classical KPI models highlights superior
   predictive fidelity, robustness, and temporal consistency. Furthermore,
   the paper delineates AI and ML applications across core maritime
   operations and introduces a scalable, modular system architecture
   applicable to both commercial and naval platforms. This approach bridges
   advanced simulation ecosystems with in situ operational data, laying a
   robust foundation for digital transformation and sustainability in
   maritime domains.

   intelligence (AI) applications for central serous chorioretinopathy
   (CSCR), analyzing challenges and outlining future research directions to
   guide personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.MethodsA
   systematic literature search was conducted in the Web of Science
   database using a comprehensive AI-related keyword set (e.g., "deep
   learning," "neural networks," "computer vision") combined with "central
   serous chorioretinopathy." The search yielded 698 records, with 73
   original research studies selected after excluding reviews and
   non-empirical work based on predefined criteria.ResultsThe application
   of AI in CSCR has progressed from disease classification to dynamic
   prognostic prediction, leveraging multimodal data fusion (e.g., optical
   coherence tomography [OCT] and OCT angiography [OCTA] and fundus
   fluorescein angiography [FFA]) to enhance both qualitative and
   quantitative diagnostic accuracy. AI models outperform clinical experts
   in classifying retinal disease subtypes and segmenting lesions. However,
   clinical translation faces infrastructural barriers (e.g., incompatible
   PACS systems) and limited physician trust due to "black box"
   decision-making. New approaches, such as explainable AI (XAI), are being
   integrated to enhance the transparency and clinical applicability of AI
   models. Key limitations involve single-center data dependency,
   interobserver annotation variability, and the inability of static
   frameworks to capture dynamic lesion progression.ConclusionAI enhances
   CSCR diagnosis and subtyping efficiency. To optimize clinical
   translation, future research should focus on multicenter data
   integration, dynamic visualization frameworks, and standardized
   guidelines, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and prospective
   trials for personalized treatment strategies. Incorporating federated
   learning for privacy-preserving data sharing and prioritizing
   explainability will be essential to overcoming barriers to physician
   adoption and improving trust in AI-driven clinical decision-making.
   Future efforts should focus on creating dynamic systems that provide
   real-time insights into lesion progression and integrating them with
   standardized protocols for wider clinical adoption.

AB Advances in orthopaedic surgery have been significantly shaped by
   evidence-based medicine (EBM), which relies on randomized controlled
   trials (RCTs) to standardize care and improve outcomes. However, EBM's
   one-size-fits-all approach often fails to account for the heterogeneous
   nature of individual patients, limiting its ability to deliver
   personalized care. Personalized data-driven practice (PDDP), powered by
   AI, provides a transformative solution by integrating diverse data
   sources, including genetic and clinical data, imaging, and wearable
   device outputs, into patient-specific treatment strategies. This paper
   examines the complementary roles of EBM and PDDP, highlighting the
   capacity of AI-driven tools to enhance decision-making in orthopaedics.
   AI technologies, such as machine learning and Bayesian networks, enable
   predictive analytics, treatment personalization, and real-time data
   integration, fostering a shift from reactive to proactive care. However,
   challenges related to data quality, algorithm transparency, ethical
   considerations, and infrastructure develop ment must be addressed to
   ensure robust and equitable implementation. By merging AI-enhanced PDDP
   with the established principles of EBM, orthopaedic practice can evolve
   into a hybrid model that enhances patient outcomes while preserving
   clinician oversight and ethical integrity. This integration heralds a
   new era of precision orthopaedics, offering a patient-centred approach
   in the context of big data and AI innovation.-

AB The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) plays a vital role in the cultural
   and economic sectors of the Middle East, Asia, and North Africa.
   Accurate and efficient classification of date fruit varieties is
   crucial, yet traditional manual sorting methods remain inefficient and
   error-prone. This study aims to develop an automated classification
   system using machine learning classifiers, address data imbalances with
   generative AI techniques, and enhance model interpretability through
   Explainable AI methods. The dataset used in this study contains 898
   samples, each comprising 34 features extracted from images of seven
   different types of date fruits. The Generative AI technique, Conditional
   Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), was utilized to address
   class imbalance issues by generating synthetic data. Four classifiers,
   XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and
   Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were trained on balanced training data and
   tested on separate test data. Additionally, the Explainable AI method,
   SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), was employed to interpret feature
   importance, enhancing transparency and understanding of the model's
   decision-making. Results indicated that the MLP classifier achieved the
   highest accuracy of 96.11%, with Precision, Recall, and F1 Score values
   of 94.80%, 95.38%, and 95.02%, respectively. Our approach combining
   generative and explainable AI techniques significantly improves the
   efficiency and reliability of date fruit classification systems,
   offering a scalable and interpretable solution for automating grading
   and quality assessment. This research provides a practical, data-driven
   framework for agricultural applications, with potential extensions to
   real-time data integration and hybrid models for further performance
   enhancement.

AB Infectious/contagious diseases remain a significant global health
   challenge, necessitating accurate identification to mitigate their
   spread. The widespread adoption of wearable healthcare devices capable
   of continuously monitoring physiological parameters presents a unique
   opportunity for enhancing disease detection strategies. In this article,
   we develop a new data fusion-enabled explainable artificial
   intelligence-assisted light gradient boosting model (LightGBM) (FuXAI)
   model in edge networks to predict contagious disease in the early stage.
   The overall contributions of the proposed FuXAI model are threefold.
   First, we create a comprehensive health profile for each individual by
   employing data fusion techniques and integrating health parameters
   received from multiple sources. Second, we integrate a new lightweight
   machine learning (ML) model, the LightGBM, to predict the disease at
   resource-constraint edge devices over the fused data. Finally, we
   leverage the power of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to
   develop interpretable algorithms, integrating with the LightGBM that can
   identify subtle patterns and correlations within the fused data,
   potentially revealing early warning signs of infectious diseases and
   creating trust in medical professionals during decision-making.
   Extensive simulation results of the proposed model over the standard ML
   models using benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   model.

AB Deep learning (DL) technology has shown significant potential in the
   whole process of cataract diagnosis and treatment through algorithms
   such as convolutional neural network (CNN). In terms of diagnosis, DL
   models based on fundus or slit-lamp images can automatically identify
   and grade cataract, and their diagnostic accuracy is close to or beyond
   the level of human experts. In the field of surgery, DL can analyze the
   operation video stage in real time, accurately track the instruments and
   optimize the operation process, and reduce the risk of intraoperative
   eye error through intelligent devices. DL could optimize the intraocular
   lens (IOL) power calculation, predict the risk of complications and
   long-term surgery requirements. However, insufficient data
   standardization, the "black box" characteristics of the model, and
   privacy ethics issues are still the bottlenecks in clinical application.
   In the future, it is necessary to improve the generalization ability of
   model through multimodal data fusion, federated learning and other
   technologies, and combine interpretable design (such as Grad-CAM) to
   promote the evolution of DL to a transparent medical decision-making
   tool, and finally realize the intelligence and universality of cataract
   management.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous ground vehicles are
   increasingly outfitted with advanced sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and
   GPS, enabling real-time object detection, tracking, localization, and
   navigation. These platforms generate high-volume sensory data, such as
   video streams and point clouds, that require efficient processing to
   support timely and informed decision-making. Although video synopsis
   techniques are widely used for visual data summarization, they encounter
   significant challenges in multi-sensor environments due to disparities
   in sensor modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
   sensory data synopsis framework designed for both UAV and autonomous
   vehicle applications. The proposed system integrates a dualtask learning
   model with a real-time sensor fusion module to jointly perform abnormal
   object segmentation and depth estimation by combining LiDAR and camera
   data. The framework comprises a sensory fusion algorithm, a 3D-to-2D
   projection mechanism, and a Metropolis-Hastings-based trajectory
   optimization strategy to refine object tubes and construct concise,
   temporally-shifted synopses. This design selectively preserves and
   repositions salient information across space and time, enhancing
   synopsis clarity while reducing computational overhead. Experimental
   evaluations conducted on standard datasets (i.e., KITTI, Cityscapes, and
   DVS) demonstrate that our framework achieves a favorable balance between
   segmentation accuracy and inference speed. In comparison with existing
   studies, it yields superior performance in terms of frame reduction,
   recall, and F1 score. The results highlight the robustness, real-time
   capability, and broad applicability of the proposed approach to
   intelligent surveillance, smart infrastructure, and autonomous mobility
   systems.

AB Driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies, smart cities are becoming more sophisticated. In smart
   cities, intelligent applications such as traffic optimization,
   environmental monitoring and emergency response develop intelligent
   decisions with AI models. The core of smart decision-making lies in the
   intelligent analysis and processing of real-time data collected by IoT
   devices, which supports the intelligent and precise operation of cities.
   However, the credibility of data sources directly affects the quality of
   decision-making and the effectiveness of AI models. Issues such as
   tampering, falsification, or failure of data sources not only lead to
   biased decisions but may also jeopardize the stability and security of
   urban systems. Therefore, conducting trust evaluations on data
   collection terminals in intelligent scenarios is crucial for ensuring
   the reliable operation of smart cities. This paper proposes a
   multidimensional trust evaluation method for data collection in
   intelligent applications of smart cities. Moreover, this method can
   effectively detect sophisticated attacks, such as data poisoning and
   insider threats. By incorporating static, dynamic, and energy trust
   assessments, and applying the Technique for Order Preference by
   Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to generate an integrated trust
   value, this approach ensures data credibility from the source and
   provides reliable data support for smart decision-making.

AB This paper introduces an enhanced deep learning multimodal framework for
   real-time pain assessment that addresses the limitations of the
   single-mode approaches. Specifically, time-related disadvantages and its
   poor temporal analysis, noted in recent studies. The proposed framework
   fuses VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group 16-layer network), a pre-trained
   convolutional neural network (CNN), with a bidirectional long short-term
   memory network (Bi-LSTM) augmented with attention mechanisms. VGG16 has
   a proven ability to capture fine-grained spatial information in facial
   expressions to extract powerful spatial features, whereas the Bi-LSTM
   augmented with attention mechanisms because of its computational
   efficiency and concisely captures temporal features. Moreover, adaptive
   boosting has used seeking generalization across a broad base of settings
   and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to provide
   comprehensible and interpretable visual explanations of the
   decision-making processes of the framework. Extensive evaluations were
   conducted on diverse popular benchmark datasets: BioVid, UNBC-McMaster,
   and MIntPAIN. Our framework achieves an AUC (the Area under the Receiver
   Operating Characteristic Curve) of 0.99 and 99% cross-validation
   accuracy, corresponding to a 12.5% improvement in accuracy and a 20%
   reduction in false positives relative to state-ofthe-art convolutional
   neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) models. Real-time
   deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano yields 120 ms (ms) inference per
   frame with less than 1% accuracy loss, demonstrating its feasibility for
   edge-based telemedicine. Combined with explainability via Grad-CAM and
   privacy-preserving vision-only inputs, this framework offers an ethical,
   scalable solution for nonverbal pain detection.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming pancreaticobiliary
   endoscopy by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, procedural efficiency, and
   clinical outcomes. This narrative review explores AI's applications in
   endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde
   cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), emphasizing its potential to address
   diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in pancreaticobiliary diseases. In
   EUS, AI improves pancreatic mass differentiation, malignancy prediction,
   and landmark recognition, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and
   outperforming traditional guidelines. In ERCP, AI facilitates precise
   biliary stricture identification, optimizes procedural techniques, and
   supports decision-making through real-time data integration, improving
   ampulla recognition and predicting cannulation difficulty. Additionally,
   predictive analytics help mitigate complications like post-ERCP
   pancreatitis. The future of AI in pancreaticobiliary endoscopy lies in
   multimodal data fusion, integrating imaging, genomic, and molecular data
   to enable personalized medicine. However, challenges such as data
   quality, external validation, clinician training, and ethical
   concerns-like data privacy and algorithmic bias-must be addressed to
   ensure safe implementation. By overcoming these challenges, AI has the
   potential to redefine pancreaticobiliary healthcare, improving
   diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic outcomes, and personalized care.

AB Digital twin-driven discrete manufacturing workshops exhibit the 3Vs
   characteristics of manufacturing data: volume, variety, and velocity.
   While extensive research has addressed data analytics and
   decision-making, the seamless integration of workshop manufacturing data
   with applications remains a significant challenge, leading to
   information silos. Current data interoperability solutions primarily
   focus on basic data collection and transmission, lacking comprehensive
   capabilities in heterogeneous resource integration, multi-source
   information modeling, massive data management, and value extraction.
   This paper presents an advanced plug-and-play Industrial Internet of
   Things (IIoT) gateway solution that addresses three critical challenges
   through key innovations: (1) unified data interaction mechanisms
   supporting heterogeneous manufacturing equipment and protocols, enabling
   efficient visual-physical integration; (2) edge-layer data preprocessing
   and model encapsulation capabilities that transform unstructured
   terminal data into standardized formats for cloud twins; and (3)
   intelligent edge computing functions that enable real-time anomaly
   detection and response in production processes, reducing reliance on
   centralized cloud computing. Implementation in a digital twin mold
   manufacturing workshop demonstrates that the gateway solution reduces
   information encapsulation time by 57.3%, improves anomaly response time
   by 44%, and decreases memory utilization by 33.5% compared to
   traditional approaches, validating its effectiveness for MDTMS

AB Industrial integration is a major trend in the development of various
   industries in China. Cultural resources are the core resources of the
   tourism industry. For the tourism industry, only by deeply integrating
   the tourism industry with the cultural industry and enriching the
   connotation of the tourism industry with cultural content can the
   healthy development of the tourism industry be promoted. IoT sensors can
   detect various signals in the external environment, are widely used in
   many industries, and play an important role in realizing real-time
   monitoring of data and collecting information. Data fusion is the
   process of integrating and correlating a large amount of data obtained
   by IoT sensors, so as to obtain the location, identity, and other
   information of the IoT sensing end according to the analysis results,
   thereby realizing real-time processing and decision-making of the data.
   Both technologies have applications in various industries, and the
   cultural and creative tourism industry is no exception. At present,
   Chinese cultural and creative tourism has problems such as lack of
   in-depth exploration, weak brand awareness, shallow industrial
   integration, backward online services, weak sense of innovation, and
   lack of leadership. In order to improve the development of cultural and
   creative tourism in China, we take Songcheng as an example to
   investigate the development of cultural and creative tourism in
   Songcheng, and based on the Internet of Things and data fusion
   technology, we propose to build an intelligent creative generation
   platform, which effectively solves the problem of cultural creativity.
   The development of tourism is difficult. And this article also puts
   forward some opinions based on this. The development of cultural and
   creative tourism should achieve the following four points: (1) Based on
   culture, promote the integration of culture and tourism. (2) Use
   products as the medium to create distinctive cultural and creative
   products. (3) Use creative marketing methods to build personalized
   branding. (4) Drive the integration of tourism resources with a
   characteristic management system. Promote the development of Chinese
   cultural and creative tourism industry from four aspects: content,
   products, marketing, and management.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging next-generation technology in
   the fourth industrial revolution. The Industrial IoT is required to
   transmit the collected data in a timely manner to support real-time
   monitoring, control and automation. In such systems, the timeliness of
   information is very important, and meanwhile, different physical
   processes have different requirements on the accuracy of timeliness.
   However, existing performance metrics, such as the Age of Information
   (AoI), are unable to fully evaluate the timeliness of information with
   heterogeneous physical processes. Recently, we proposed an
   information-theoretic metric named the "Value of Information" (VoI) to
   measure the usefulness of information in the context of a heterogeneous
   and noisy environment. In this work, we study a joint path planning of
   the mobile robot and user scheduling optimization problem in Industrial
   IoT networks with the aim of maximizing the minimum VoI among all users
   under mobility and communication constraints. We formulate this
   optimization problem as a Markov decision process, and propose a
   reinforcement learning-based algorithm to find the VoI-aware mobility
   and communication strategy efficiently. Through numerical results, we
   show that the proposed method can capture the impact of data freshness,
   inherent correlation characteristics of underlying data sources and
   noise on the usefulness of information. Compared with the existing
   AoI-aware strategy, the proposed VoI-aware strategy achieves better
   performance by exploiting the heterogeneity of data sources especially
   when the wireless resource is limited.

AB Infrastructure assets, such as pavements, naturally deteriorate over
   time due to traffic loads, environmental conditions, and other external
   factors. Traditionally, deterministic models have been employed to
   predict performance, aiding in work planning and budget allocation.
   However, these models often fail to capture the complex, non-linear
   deterioration mechanisms and uncertainties inherent in real-world
   conditions. Stochastic models provide a more robust and flexible
   framework by incorporating probabilistic methods to address variability
   and uncertainty in asset condition data. Techniques such as Markov
   chains, Semi-Markov processes, Bayesian approaches, and Gaussian Process
   Regression (GPR) enable more accurate parameter estimation and model
   selection by integrating all plausible scenarios weighted by their
   probabilities. These innovated models excel in forecasting future
   pavement conditions, even with incomplete or uncertain data, and are
   particularly suited for long-term performance prediction. This paper
   critically reviews the development and application of stochastic-based
   degradation models in pavement performance forecasting, highlighting
   their advantages over deterministic approaches. By accounting for
   uncertainty and variability, stochastic models not only enhance
   prediction accuracy but also support cost-effective, data-driven
   decision-making. They provide infrastructure managers with a reliable
   foundation for optimizing maintenance strategies, risk assessments, and
   life cycle cost analyses. Future research should focus on robust
   calibration techniques, addressing GPR scalability through advanced
   computational methods, integrating real-time data for dynamic updates,
   expanding Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and combining
   deterministic and stochastic models to balance efficiency and accuracy.
   Incorporating stochastic predictions into life cycle cost analyses will
   further strengthen decision-support systems for infrastructure
   management.

AB Entity Resolution (ER) is a fundamental task in data integration,
   enabling the identification of records that refer to the same real-world
   entity across diverse and often heterogeneous data sources. Recent
   advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly improved ER
   performance, particularly with deep learning and pre-trained embeddings.
   However, these AI-driven solutions introduce new challenges related to
   fairness and explainability. Fairness-aware ER seeks to mitigate bias
   that may arise from algorithmic decision-making or imbalanced training
   data, while eXplainable Entity Resolution (XER) aims to enhance
   transparency and trust in ER. In this work, we provide a comprehensive
   overview of fairness and explainability in ER, systematically analyzing
   existing techniques across the ER pipeline. We discuss challenges in
   ensuring unbiased and interpretable ER outcomes, with a special focus on
   streaming environments, where real-time decision-making intensifies the
   complexity of these concerns. Furthermore, we outline research
   opportunities and examine the trade-offs between schema-aware and
   schema-agnostic methods, as well as rule-based and machine
   learning-based comparison techniques, in ensuring fair and transparent
   ER. Our study highlights open research challenges and potential future
   directions, encouraging novel explainable AI methodologies and
   fairness-aware ER solutions that enhance the reliability,
   accountability, and societal impact of AI-driven ER systems.

AB Background Mobile health (mHealth) is reshaping healthcare delivery,
   especially in HIV management. The World Health Organization advocates
   for mHealth to provide healthcare workers (HCWs) with real-time data,
   enhancing client care. However, in Malawi's Lighthouse Trust
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic, the nurse-led community-based ART
   (NCAP) program faces hurdles with data management due to lack of access
   to electronic medical records systems (EMRS) in the community setting.
   EMRS are not typically available in differentiated service delivery
   settings where reliable power and internet are often unavailable. We
   used human-centered design (HCD) processes to create a mobile EMRS
   prototype, the Community-based ART Retention and Suppression (CARES)
   app. CARES aims to simplify workflow for HCWs and improve client care.
   As part of prototype testing, we explore CARES' feasibility and
   acceptability from the perspective of NCAP HCWs.Methods We conducted
   in-depth interviews among 15 NCAP HCWs. We used a rapid qualitative
   analysis approach guided by the Technology Acceptance Models (TAM1 and
   TAM2). The study complied with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting
   Qualitative Research (COREQ).Results HCWs demonstrated high perceived
   usefulness for the CARES app to improve healthcare delivery and data
   management, both of which could facilitate continued and effective use.
   However, challenges such as app performance, data integration, and
   system navigation were significant barriers to ease of use, reducing
   acceptance and current feasibility of scale-up. Despite challenges, HCWs
   remained optimistic about CARES' potential to enhance NCAP clinical
   decision-making and data flow in future, likely reflecting
   organizational expectations for CARES optimization. Beyond the TAM
   framework, additional themes of consistent staff engagement and
   considerations for sustainability were identified as critical factors
   for long-term success. HCWs emphasized the need for continuous training
   and stakeholder engagement, improved infrastructure, data security
   protections, and establishing the CARES app and EMRS integration to
   facilitate CARES' sustained expansion.Conclusion The study findings
   underscore the importance of HCD for mHealth buy-in. As HCWs were
   invested in CARES success, they remained optimistic that the app could
   enhance NCAP services if user experience and app performance improved.
   Incorporation of HCW feedback could help deliver the promise of CARES,
   current and future.

   enhance road safety and detect high-risk driving behaviors. However,
   these advanced algorithms still face several challenges. We analyze
   relevant literature from 2015 to 2024, to uncover key trends and gaps in
   the development of applications for identifying dangerous driving
   behaviors, with a primary focus on optimizing integration to improve the

AB The increasing demand for clean energy has made floating wind turbines
   (FWTs) a viable option. However, the operation and maintenance of FWTs
   face numerous challenges. The emergence of digital twins provides a
   potential solution. This study focuses on real-time monitoring and
   analysis techniques for FWTs, aiming to address key challenges in
   building the digital twin of such systems. We propose a monitoring and
   analysis framework for the digital twin of FWTs, covering three main
   aspects: ocean environment, FWT's pose, and structural state. For the
   tower structure of FWTs, we present a state inversion method based on
   limited sensors, enabling rapid and comprehensive assessment of
   structural health. Based on this, we construct a scaled model of the FWT
   and apply the proposed methods to the monitoring and analysis of an
   actual FWT, realizing a complete process from data perception, storage,
   integration, and fusion to feedback control, creating an information
   closed-loop between the physical and virtual worlds. Furthermore, the
   application of the constructed digital twin platform validates the
   feasibility and effectiveness of the methods. By deeply integrating
   digital models, ocean environment data, and FWT state data, we create a
   comprehensive digital twin of the FWT, providing crucial support for
   transparency of state information, safety risk management, intelligent
   parameter adjustments, and informed decision-making.

AB This research proposes a novel artificial decision-marking framework
   suitable for modern smart sensor networks and carbon-based biosensor
   systems which deals with uncertainty and the peculiarity of the data. To
   achieve the goals, the approach relies on the optoelectronic properties
   of carbon nanomaterials and already combines AI and deep learning. This
   raises the level of sensing, real-time data fusion, and adaptive
   decision-making within the environment to unprecedented levels. To
   enhance sensor evaluation in sensor manufacturing, we take a step
   further and implement Dombi Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets
   (D-IVIFs) and work with Dombi Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Dombi
   Bonferroni Mean (D-IVIFDBM) for hierarchical decision-making. Moreover,
   two Multi-Attribute Group Decision Making (MAGDM) methods IVIFWDBM and
   IVIFWDGBM are developed for expert evaluation aggregation in selection
   tasks of different criteria to enhance selection accuracy. These
   experiments did demonstrate improvements in decision accuracy as well as
   better overall performance than conventional models of comparison. The
   numerical experiments showed that these methods are more effective than
   traditional MAGDM models. Introducing such an advanced decision
   framework in deep learning systems enables improved adaptability,
   security, and resilience in next-generation sensor networks and
   biosensor devices. The new paradigm enables real-time signal
   interpretation and adaptive learning and provides effective solutions in
   harsh environments where severe fluctuations are common. This study
   assists in addressing the discrepancy between conceptual decision models
   and actual physical achievements in smart sensing, which will foster the
   development of more sophisticated and efficient optoelectronic devices.

AB Over recent years, the frequency and intensity of fire disasters have
   escalated, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and timely disaster
   classification and mitigation strategies. The proposed approach
   integrates fine-tuned deep learning models with real-time sensor data
   and digital twin technology to enhance fire disaster detection and early
   mitigation capabilities. This methodology leverages diverse data
   sources, including real-time Internet of Things (IoT) sensor readings,
   satellite imagery, and historical fire incident data. Advanced deep
   learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
   deep CNNs (DCNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to
   identify critical spatial and temporal patterns in the data. The models
   are trained on a comprehensive dataset encompassing environmental
   indicators, fire-prone area characteristics, and real-time
   meteorological data. A key innovation is the use of digital twin
   technology, which dynamically integrates real-time data from IoT sensors
   and simulation models to predict fire disaster scenarios accurately. The
   integration of digital twins enables continuous monitoring and virtual
   replication of physical systems, facilitating proactive decision-making
   and early warnings. This real-time assimilation enables proactive
   decision-making and resource allocation tailored to diverse geographical
   and socio-economic contexts. Performance evaluations reveal that the
   DCNN+Digital twin framework achieves a 99% classification accuracy with
   a reduced error rate of 3% over 500 runs, outperforming standalone
   models, such as RNN (90% accuracy, 10% error), CNN (96% accuracy, 8%
   error), and DCNN (97% accuracy, 6% error). The proposed approach offers
   a transformative solution to fire disaster management, promoting
   community resilience, environmental sustainability, and effective
   mitigation strategies in the face of escalating fire risks.

AB Increasing data complexity in clinical decision-making processes hinders
   physicians' ability to make rapid and accurate decisions. This study
   proposes an innovative solution to this problem by designing a
   multi-layered, adaptive Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)
   comprising interacting large language model (LLM) agents. The proposed
   system performs semantic-level information retrieval using a
   BioBERT-based vector database, enhances information retrieval by
   accessing up-to-date medical resources via the web, and restructures
   outputs by activating an adaptive optimization loop in low-confidence
   situations. Through the structuring of clinical texts, cross-validation
   of symptom analyses with literature and internet sources, and
   collaborative data fusion among agents, the system integrates
   multi-source data and produces consistent decisions. In experiments
   conducted on the MedQA, PubMedQA, and MedBullets datasets, the system
   achieved accuracies of 94%, 88%, and 84%, respectively, representing
   substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
   the significance of the proposed architecture for clinical
   decision-making reliability. This framework is not merely an information
   retrieval engine; it is a clinical intelligence partner designed to
   learn, actively contribute to the decision process, and focus on
   reliability. In contrast to current CDSS protocols, which frequently
   depend on static modules or single-agent models, our architecture
   tackles some of the shortcomings in timeliness, multi-source evidence
   fusion, and confidence calibration. This originality enables the system
   to be a next-generation clinical intelligence partner by enabling an
   unprecedented level of transparency, customizability, and adaptability
   in real-world decision-making processes.

AB There are various challenges that the retail sector faces these days,
   and these include the fluctuating customer trends, poor inventory
   management especially when dealing with multiple channels, and language
   barriers. This paper proposes an AI-enabled Hybrid Edge-to-Cloud
   Infrastructure as the right solution to the challenges in the retail
   supply chain. This solution will streamline the data visualization and
   communication and increase the efficiency of the communication while at
   the same time improving the inventory demand forecasting.
   The combination of AI algorithms and a mix of models into one platform
   will transform the supply chain by offering direct solutions to current
   inefficiencies. The fabric has self-learning AI algorithms on the edge
   to react to changing demand patterns to enable localized decision-making
   for replenishment inventory items and accurate demand forecasting for
   last-mile delivery planning. In cloud computing technology solutions,
   generative AI creates scenarios-based models for longer-term planning
   and multi-channel communication for cross-functional collaboration.
   An advanced hierarchy-based blending feature makes it easy to sync edge
   and cloud operations without losing time transmitting data or making
   real-time decisions. The platform also consists of AI-advanced
   communication protocols focusing on data flow for reliable information
   flow across supply chain networks. It uses shortened technical language
   and prioritizes outcome-driven practical gains and action.
   Using real-world cases and actual implementations, this model exhibits
   fewer supply chain failures, more consistent demand and supply
   alignment, and significant savings. By confronting them with novel
   solutions, this research is an innovation-driven case study for retail
   supply chains to see how the AI fusion of edge and cloud can improve
   efficiency, agility, and scale to address dynamic challenges.

   single platform provides complete coverage of all requirements.
   Technical challenges assessment quantifies real-time processing
   requirements as the most critical challenge (90/100), followed by
   generalization limitations (85/100). These suggest that while rule-based
   approaches offer computational efficiency and interpretability, deep
   learning methods demonstrate superior perception and decision-making
   capabilities. A balanced combination of learning-based, rule-based, and
   simulation-based validation approaches, with particular emphasis on
   addressing real-time performance and generalization capabilities, will
   likely be necessary to achieve reliable autonomous driving systems
   capable of navigating complex and dynamic environments.

AB Advancements in intraoperative data acquisition and analytics are
   transforming surgical care by integrating diverse information streams
   into cohesive, real-time decision-support systems. This review explores
   the use of physiological monitoring, medical imaging, instrument motion
   data, surgical video, and environmental metrics within next-generation
   operating rooms. Traditional vital sign monitoring is now augmented by
   wearable and minimally invasive technologies capable of continuously
   capturing respiratory rate, heart rate, skin temperature, and
   hemodynamic parameters such as stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic
   vascular resistance, and mean arterial pressure. Real-time imaging
   modalities including intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography,
   3-dimensional fluoroscopy with image fusion, ultrasound, and Doppler
   systems provide dynamic anatomical context to guide precision
   interventions. Concurrently, computer vision and artificial intelligence
   tools are being applied to surgical video and kinematic data to identify
   procedural phases, assess performance, and recognize critical events.
   Predictive analytics models, trained on large procedural datasets, can
   anticipate adverse outcomes like excessive blood loss or prolonged
   operative time, enhancing intraoperative awareness. Smart operating room
   platforms integrate these multimodal data sources into centralized
   interfaces, enabling synchronized documentation, workflow coordination,
   and team communication. Moreover, emerging concepts such as
   patient-specific surgical simulation and digital twin models offer
   personalized guidance and outcome forecasting. Despite these advances,
   challenges remain in managing data overload, achieving system
   interoperability, ensuring regulatory compliance, and safeguarding
   privacy.

AB Sustainable land-use planning and catastrophe risk reduction depend
   critically on landslide susceptibility mapping. The complex, nonlinear
   interconnections of environmental and human elements cause terrain
   instability and challenge conventional prediction methods. In this work,
   we offer a DeepLabV3+-based deep learning framework coupled with
   geographic information systems and multicriteria decision making methods
   for spatial prediction of landslide risk, over the Dubai coastal and
   urban region (covering approximately 4000 km(2)). The approach uses an
   annotated dataset for semantic segmentation and high-resolution
   satellite images from the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center. On Google
   Colab with GPU acceleration, the model is trained and verified and then
   further improved for computational efficiency on a Mac M1 machine. Our
   results show an overall accuracy of 91.3%, a mean intersection over
   union of 82.5%, and an F1-score of 88.4%, demonstrating strong
   classification performance throughout a range of land cover types. The
   confusion matrix analysis highlights strong segmentation accuracy for
   water bodies (94.2%) and structures (92.4%). Considerable
   misclassification between roadways and unpaved terrain results from
   spectral similarities. Furthermore, the perclass Dice Coefficient
   analysis confirms that the model can efficiently discriminate intricate
   topographical patterns. Especially in fast-expanding areas such as
   Dubai, UAE, it provides a scalable solution for landslide susceptibility
   mapping, catastrophe risk management, and sustainable urban design.
   Future work will explore multisensor data fusion, real-time inference,
   and applying explainable artificial intelligence techniques to enhance
   model interpretability in dynamic terrain settings.

AB This study introduces an educational framework inspired by Vygotsky's
   zone of proximal development, addressing the limitations of conventional
   AI learning systems through multimodal data integration. Moving beyond
   single-modality approaches, the architecture synthesizes behavioral
   patterns, physiological responses, cognitive evaluations, and language
   interactions to create dynamic learner profiles. Technical innovations
   include heatmap-driven visual transformers for analyzing interface
   behaviors, hybrid neural networks aligning micro-expressions with
   emotional states, and context-aware attention mechanisms that
   dynamically prioritize multimodal relationships. The system employs
   hierarchical decision-making, combining real-time state detection with
   longitudinal competency tracking to deliver adaptive interventions.
   Validated across diverse educational settings-from K-12 classrooms to
   vocational training and special education-the framework demonstrates
   improved learning outcomes through personalized content adaptation and
   real-time feedback. Privacy safeguards are embedded through federated
   learning architectures and on-device processing, balancing data utility
   with ethical imperatives. While emphasizing AI's capacity to enhance
   educational accessibility, the research underscores the irreplaceable
   role of human educators in maintaining empathetic mentorship. The work
   bridges pedagogical theory with technological innovation, proposing
   scalable solutions for equitable learning ecosystems. Future directions
   explore integration with emerging neuro-technologies while maintaining
   focus on transparent, human-centered AI applications across varied

AB University campuses, as distinctive yet commonplace urban environments,
   face similar challenges of high population density and efficient
   management. Integrating digital twins into smart campus construction is
   essential for optimizing campus management. Multimodal data integration
   and visualization are key to building a digital twin campus. Traditional
   visualization methods often lack effective inter-data relationships,
   limiting their capacity to support robust multimodal data integration
   and create a multidimensional, real-time, comprehensive management view.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a tailored approach for multimodal data
   integration and visualization in digital twin campus construction.
   First, a comprehensive analysis of multimodal campus data identifies
   spatiotemporal associations among datasets. Subsequently, visualization
   strategies are developed based on these data characteristics and
   associations, enabling the multidimensional integration of 3D models,
   video surveillance, and wireless sensor data. Finally, a prototype
   system is implemented and evaluated through a case study. The results
   demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently integrates 2D maps,
   surveillance videos, and sensor data to create a dynamic, interactive,
   and panoramic campus view, achieving rendering efficiency exceeding 60
   frames per second. Moreover, this adaptable framework can be applied to
   various campus or geographic contexts, offering critical technical
   support for multimodal visualization in IoT and big data environments.

AB Recent autonomous driving systems heavily rely on 3D point cloud data
   collected from multiple sensors for environmental awareness and
   decision-making. However, it is unrealistic to expect the autonomous
   driving system to recognize all road environments and handle every
   traffic situation. Models for autonomous driving need to be updated in
   real time in order for the system to adapt to more situations. This is
   where online continual learning becomes crucial. Online continual
   learning is an important method in the field of autonomous driving, as
   it enables models to update their parameters with streaming input data
   for adapting to new environments and conditions. Online continual
   learning in the field of autonomous driving faces several challenges:
   inefficient data fusion, catastrophic forgetting, insufficient
   computational resources, violation of road privacy and categories
   imbalance. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Analytic Online
   Continual Learning method for 3D Point Cloud Classification (3D-AOCL).
   This approach utilizes Analytic Learning to update parameters and
   integrates a feature fusion module along with a category balancer to
   address the above issues. It is capable of fusing data in feature level,
   balancing samples across various categories and updating parameters by
   calculating the analytical solution. We have validated our method on the
   vehicle side, the infrastructure side, and vehicle-infrastructure
   cooperative data on the V2X-Seq dataset. The experimental results
   demonstrate that our model effectively addresses key issues in online
   continual learning for autonomous driving systems, outperforming other
   models by approximately 4.00% to 6.00% in AMCA scores while only keeping
   0.75% trainable parameters.

AB People counting is a relevant task for many different applications in
   the sensor domain requiring real-time monitoring of a closed
   environment. One of these cases can be found in the public transport
   sector, where information such as the occupancy rate of each vehicle can
   be an important factor in decision making for related organizations as
   well as users. Impulse Radio Ultrawideband (IR-UWB) sensors have proved
   to be a successful tool in such tasks, but challenges introduced by
   noise and multipath propagation of the signals can significantly hinder
   the performance of these systems. AI and Machine Learning have been
   widely utilized to address such challenges; however, inherent weaknesses
   related to data collection are an obstacle to the reliable deployment of
   these solutions in real-world scenarios. In this paper the feasibility
   of an AI-based UWB people counting system in a public transport vehicle
   has been studied. Four different experimental datasets have been
   produced in semistatic conditions, each being individually used to train
   and test four AI models to solve the task. Particular emphasis during
   the analysis was placed on the quantity and variety of data used for
   training, including the fusion of multiple sensor readings and the
   splitting of the datasets using two methods addressing different
   challenges. Results proved the fusion of data from different sources to
   be beneficial, as the models were able to correctly classify up to 100%
   of the signals from the test set when trained on an exhaustive amount of
   data. Performing inference on unseen static configurations has led to
   satisfactory results on simpler scenarios, with the best models
   attaining up to 91.5% accuracy, while achieving so under more difficult
   environments is left to subsequent research.

AB Autonomy and cooperation are envisaged as the pillars for the effective

   the deployment at sea of the required advanced cooperative autonomy
   capabilities dictates that the adopted control architectures are

   Aiming at these objectives, we propose and describe the development of a
   mission manager module based on Behaviour Trees, integrated in our
   intelligent Cooperative Autonomous Decision Making Engine (iCADME)
   autonomy architecture. BTs are an AI technique, which provides
   reactivity, modularity and the appealing possibility to assemble complex

   iCADME development, and increase the flexibility and adaptability from a
   mission execution standpoint.
   We report and discuss results of iCADME, working with a BT-based mission
   manager, during MEDASWAN23 trial. Our multi-robot underwater network was
   successfully controlled in a surveillance mission, involving real-time

AB Nowadays IoT applications play an increasing role in our lives, which
   require adaptive solutions to meet an acceptable level of quality. To
   support this need, IoT is often coupled with fog and cloud services,
   especially for real-time applications, where short latency and fast data
   integration matter the most. To manage such IoT-Fog-Cloud systems
   effectively, task offloading methods are needed, which represent an
   NP-hard problem, to be addressed by scheduling algorithms using some
   sort of heuristics. In this paper, we present a fuzzy-based offloading
   algorithm improved by machine learning-based time-series prediction to
   boost its decision making, and thus to reach efficient system usage. We
   also extend and use the DISSECT-CF-Fog simulator to evaluate our
   proposed approach on a real-world-based IoT use case. Our results showed
   improvements by reducing execution time of the considered IoT
   application with essentially the same utilisation cost, energy
   consumption and network usage.

AB Global warming and climate change have been subjects of great interest
   in recent years. They are understood to be related to greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. Although agriculture suffers the consequences of these
   changes, it is one of the top global emitters of GHG. While it is
   complex in environmental, social, and economic aspects, there is a need
   to advance solutions for more sustainable agriculture. In the farm
   environment, an important step is the generation of GHG inventories. A
   GHG inventory is a systematic process for measuring and recording gas
   emissions and sequestration. However, generating inventories on rural
   properties presents many challenges due to the many variables involved,
   such as land use, animal husbandry, use of electricity, and fuels. One
   of the main challenges is to deal with this data heterogeneity. The data
   landscape presents obstacles such as managing source diversity, handling
   massive data volumes, adapting to various data formats, and ensuring
   real-time integration for decision-making. In this complex data
   landscape, ontologies emerge as a potential solution. An ontology is
   defined as a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain
   and the relationships between those concepts. This study proposes an
   ontological model called CarbOnto for the syntactic and semantic
   integration of heterogeneous databases. Using an ontology, we intend to
   contribute to the standardization and interpretation of domain concepts
   and the addition of semantic information to generate complete GHG
   inventories. CarboOnto provides the means to generate farm inventories,
   identify imbalances, and search for solutions to neutralize gas
   emissions. We report a Case Study and argue that using this ontology can
   support balancing these gases.

AB Industrial dairy farms boast highly advanced health monitoring and
   disease diagnosis systems. But without easily accessible, user-friendly
   web platforms for real-time decision-making, most dairy farmers cannot
   proactively manage herd health management and optimize treatments based
   on disease prediction and prevention. To bridge this gap, we have
   developed a web application of a Decision support system (DSS) for dairy
   health management based on machine learning. The system architecture
   combines a Flask backend with a React frontend and scalable cloud data
   storage and includes preprocessing, data integration, predictive
   modelling, and cost analysis. DSS forecasts herd diseases with an
   accuracy 6.66 mean absolute error and 2.35 median absolute deviation
   across predictions. Its core predictive capabilities rely on long
   short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast disease progression
   from historical records and on a linear trend model to project cuts in
   treatment costs. The system calculates medication dosages and cost per
   disease, streamlines supplier selection, and simulates various treatment
   scenarios, thereby identifying high-cost diseases with potential
   savings. In other words, this DSS application processes disease and
   treatment data by incorporating veterinary records into advanced data
   analytics and neural networks, thereby predicting diseases, optimizing
   disease prevention and treatment strategies, and reducing costs. As
   such, this DSS application provides dairy farmers with a tool for
   strategic decision-making, veterinary treatment planning, and
   cost-effective disease management towards improving animal welfare and
   increasing milk yield.

AB This paper presents an innovative framework for Large Action Model (LAM)
   enablement, called ActionFusion, to enhance the capability of AI systems
   to perform autonomous complex actions in real-world dynamic
   environments. Several key innovations are introduced in this framework,
   which include multi-modal data fusion, hierarchical action
   representation, hybrid learning mechanisms that unify reinforcement
   learning and self-supervised learning, and optimized real-time
   decision-making algorithms. These features, targeted to collectively
   address the scalability, adaptability, and latency challenges presented
   by current AI action modeling, are analyzed in key enabling technologies
   for each layer of the framework. The architecture of this approach is
   modular and open, ensuring interoperability across different AI
   subsystems and various domains, such as autonomous robotics, vehicles,
   healthcare, smart environments, and industrial automation. Potential
   applications demonstrate how ActionFusion transforms the field by
   improving the autonomy, safety, and capabilities of AI-powered systems.
   This study also points out key design considerations and future research
   directions like data integration techniques, adaptability, human-AI
   collaboration, ethics, and emerging technologies.

AB The outbreak and subsequent recurring waves of COVID -19 pose threats on
   the emergency management and people's daily life, while the large-scale
   spatio-temporal epidemiological data have sure come in handy in epidemic
   surveillance. Nonetheless, some challenges remain to be addressed in
   terms of multi-source heterogeneous data fusion, deep mining, and
   comprehensive applications. The Spatio-Temporal Artificial Intelligence
   (STAI) technology, which focuses on integrating spatial related
   time-series data, artificial intelligence models, and digital tools to
   provide intelligent computing platforms and applications, opens up new
   opportunities for scientific epidemic control. To this end, we leverage
   STAI and long-term experience in location-based intelligent services in
   the work. Specifically, we devise and develop a STAI-driven digital
   infrastructure, namely, WAYZ Disease Control Intelligent Platform
   (WDCIP), which consists of a systematic framework for building pipelines
   from automatic spatio-temporal data collection, processing to AI-based
   analysis and inference implementation for providing appropriate
   applications serving various epidemic scenarios. According to the
   platform implementation logic, our work can be performed and summarized
   from three aspects: (1) a STAI-driven integrated system; (2) a hybrid
   GNN-based approach for hierarchical risk assessment (as the core
   algorithm of WDCIP); and (3) comprehensive applications for social
   epidemic containment. This work makes a pivotal contribution to
   facilitating the aggregation and full utilization of spatio-temporal
   epidemic data from multiple sources, where the real-time human mobility
   data generated by high-precision mobile positioning plays a vital role
   in sensing the spread of the epidemic. So far, WDCIP has accumulated
   more than 200 million users who have been served in life convenience and
   decision-making during the pandemic.

AB A transferable infrastructure to enable FAIR timeseries data The field
   of earth system sciences relies heavily on the collection, analysis, and
   interpretation of data to understand complex spatiotemporal environment
   processes and predict future trends. Time series data, which captures
   measurements or observations at regular intervals over time, plays a
   crucial role in elucidating patterns, detecting changes, and informing
   decision-making in various environmental domains. However, the effective
   storage and management of time series data present significant
   challenges that necessitate the development of robust and scalable data
   infrastructures. A well-designed data infrastructure is crucial to
   ensure the reliability, accessibility, interoperability, and
   sustainability of time series data across different domains and scales.
   It enables efficient data collection through automated sensing
   technologies, standardized data exchange protocols, and quality control
   procedures. Moreover, robust time series data infrastructures facilitate
   the integration of data from diverse sources into distributed data
   infrastructures on national and/or continental scales and advances the
   dissemination of data to a wide range of stakeholders including
   scientists, policymakers, resource managers, and the general public. The
   focus lies on enhancing accessibility for end users, operators, system
   integrators, and maintainers. The time series management system
   encompasses all essential components. It features a user-centric
   web-based frontend, a versatile data integration layer, a robust time
   series database, efficient object storage, real-time quality control,
   and comprehensive data visualization capabilities. It supports modern
   and classical data transfer protocols, and ensures compliance with OGC
   standards for data access. Moreover, our fully integrated and
   containerized solution offers the convenience of swift and effortless
   deployment within minutes and allows the seamless integration with
   existing services such as databases, identity providers, and object
   storages. This innovative infrastructure has the potential to
   significantly enhance environmental data management, fostering more
   efficient research and facilitating informed decision-making processes.

AB Highway concessionaires in Malaysia spend considerable assets in
   collecting, analysing and controlling different forms of data during
   highway projects' life cycle. Considering this massive investment,
   nowadays the data use and information system reliability is becoming the
   key concern in terms of delivering value to consumers as opposed to the
   amount generated. The data generated is extensive and heterogeneous.
   This paper provides a new paradigm for integrating green highway
   performance data with carbon footprint data for green highway
   assessment. This framework is used to improve the active use of data in
   the generation of information and to assist comprehensively in
   decision-making at all levels of management. The network approach used
   in this study is the main component for interlinking data with knowledge
   and decisions, identifying the parameters of data integration for green
   highway assessment, determining the criteria data for integration, and
   assessing the overall performance of data usage. Real-time green highway
   data scenarios are used to demonstrate the applicability of this
   framework. A new monitoring performance measure called the
   MyGHI-Dashboard is proposed to control green highway assessment
   processes and evaluate the level of data usage, which will serve as a
   green highway performance scorecard. Through data-driven insights, this
   new paradigm can be used as a benchmarking model by highway authorities
   to make efficient and accurate decisions. This study is expected to
   become the central reference to mitigate the challenge associated with
   the use of highway performance data in real-time for Malaysian highway
   development.

AB IoT devices usually produce large volume of data in low semantic levels.
   Also, they constantly communicate to the sink node. Since IoT devices
   are resource-constrained in terms of battery, memory and processing
   power, the usage of advanced machine learning techniques to support
   real-time decision making is unfeasible. So a challenge is to provide
   machine learning techniques tailored to the resource-constrained
   environment of IoT either by adapting existing techniques or developing
   new ones. In this paper, we propose an heuristic for adapting data
   prediction and data fusion techniques to preprocess data to avoid
   unnecessary communication between sensor devices and sink node. Also, in
   this work we compare (i) linear estimation; (ii) Weightless Neural
   Networks; and (iii) Moving Average Convergence Divergence in the
   aforementioned context. The main contribution is the proposal of an
   heuristics to mitigate unnecessary communications while avoiding data
   accuracy loss by combining data fusion and data prediction techniques.
   As implementation of the heuristics we present in this work, we
   introduce two algorithms: Dione and Delfos. Dione as a centralized
   approach and Delfos as a decentralized approach. We executed experiments
   to assess the performance of Dione and Delfos.

AB Introduction: Good quality and real-time epidemiological COVID-19 data
   are paramount to fight this pandemic through
   statistical/machine-learning based decision-making support mechanisms.
   Aims: Evaluate the resources available and used to gather COVID-19
   epidemiological data by Portuguese health authorities from the onset of
   the pandemic until December 2020. The analysis laid on two main topics:
   (a) work processes at the Public Health Unit (PHU) level and (b)
   registry forms for epidemiological reporting and control procedures.
   Recommendations on requirements to overcome problems related to data
   integration and interoperability in order to build robust
   decision-making support mechanisms will also be produced.
   Methods: For topic (a), we revised the Portuguese Directorate-General of
   Health (DGS) guidelines for data treatment. For topic (b), we analysed
   the forms used during first and second waves, while comparing them with
   DGS metadata provided to researchers.
   Results: On topic (a), we detected the use of two complementary and
   noninteroperable systems. Further, the workflow does not seem to promote
   data quality and facilitates the occurrence of communication problems
   between health professionals. On topic (b), we found 27 deleted
   questions, 6 new questions, 1 displaced question, and 1 text
   modification between the 2 form versions.
   Discussion: Both the workflow and data gathering methods are not the
   best suited for the generation of good quality data. They do not
   effectively support Public Health Professionals (PHP) nor provide the
   elements for posterior data analysis. The use of data by decision-making
   support mechanisms demands a careful planning of the data used to depict
   reality, and this condition is not met by the currently used forms.

AB To accelerate the adoption of Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) for
   production, an understanding of MAM process-structure-property (PSP)
   relationships is indispensable for quality control. A multitude of
   physical phenomena involved in MAM necessitates the use of multi-modal
   and in-process sensing techniques to model, monitor and control the
   process. The data generated from these sensors and process actuators are
   fused in various ways to advance our understanding of the process and to
   estimate both process status and part-in-progress states. This paper
   presents a hierarchical in-process data fusion framework for MAM,
   consisting of pointwise, trackwise, layerwise and partwise data
   analytics. Data fusion can be performed at raw data, feature, decision
   or mixed levels. The multi-scale data fusion framework is illustrated in
   detail using a laser powder bed fusion process for anomaly detection,
   material defect isolation, and part quality prediction. The multi-scale
   data fusion can be generally applied and integrated with real-time MAM
   process control, near-real-time layerwise repairing and buildwise
   decision making. The framework can be utilized by the AM research and
   standards community to rapidly develop and deploy interoperable tools
   and standards to analyze, process and exploit two or more different
   types of AM data. Common engineering standards for AM data fusion
   systems will dramatically improve the ability to detect, identify and
   locate part flaws, and then derive optimal policies for process control.

AB The nuclear safety video display unit (SVDU) in the nuclear safety level
   DCS implements functions such as displaying and warning of reactor
   safety related parameters and sending safety control instructions, which
   belongs to safety level 1 equipment. As a high-cost complex safety level
   display device, due to its high functional complexity, high security and
   reliability requirements, and special usage scenarios, its design,
   research, and function verification have always encountered problems
   such as low intelligence and low digitization, resulting in slow
   development process, complicated product function verification, and
   inconvenient use and training, etc. After the SVDU is put into practical
   use, continuous analysis of its stability, reliability, and safety, and
   its health status monitoring and maintenance are also difficult
   technical problems.
   Based on the five-dimensional digital twin model as a design benchmark,
   a digital twin-based design method for SVDU is proposed. Taking the SVDU
   in a nuclear safety level DCS (NASPIC) as the object, the digital twin
   technology is adopted to model the physical objects such as display
   unit, human-machine interface unit, storage unit and communication
   network unit, and the high-speed industrial Ethernet network is used to
   map and interconnect the data between the components, so as to realize
   the physical fusion, model fusion and data fusion of the real SVDU and
   the virtual SVDU. With the help of data feedback from safety level DCS,
   the data, symbol display and control process of SVDU can be visualized
   and analyzed in virtual environment, and the real-time control function
   verification, fault early warning and auxiliary decision-making can be
   carried out, which improves the visibility, accessibility, operability
   and predictability of real SVDU display and control process. The
   real-time data, historical data, fault self-diagnosis data, and expert
   experience of real SVDU and virtual SVDU are incorporated into the twin
   data pool to reproduce the variable-speed replay of the historical
   operation process of SVDU and realize the post-accident condition
   analysis with multiple spatiotemporal dimensions; the record and
   analysis of self-fault diagnosis data provides the possibility of
   stability analysis services such as clock, power supply, human-machine
   input, and storage equipment, etc.
   Digital twin-based SVDU technology can ensure rapid development and
   iteration of products under the requirements of complex functions and
   high safety and reliability, and truly reproduce the display and control
   effects of SVDU, while meeting users' multiple application scenarios and
   data service requirements.

AB Cognitive radio (CR), which enables opportunistic access to
   underutilized licensed bands, has been presented as a tempting
   technology for the optimization of spectrum utilization in recent years.
   To solve the hidden terminal problem, collaborative spectrum sensing
   (CSS), which benifits from spatial diversity, has been studied
   intensively in CR networks. For current CSS schemes, secondary users
   (SUs) are generally assumed to send sensing information honestly,
   however, misbehaved SUs may report false sensing data to mislead and
   compromise the system, which is called spectrum sensing data
   falsification (SSDF) attacks. In order to defense against malicious SSDF
   attacks, certain evidence-theory-based secure sensing approaches have
   been proposed. However, in most of the current evidence-theory-based CSS
   schemes, only real-time evidence information is utilized to estimate the
   sensing reliability of cognitive users, like the difference in SNR or
   similarity degree. Inadequate consideration causes CSS system being
   vulnerable to SSDF attacks, and the correctness of global decision
   making cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a credible CSS
   scheme based on evidence theory. It evaluates the credibility of each SU
   with two indexes, which are the statistical reputation factor and the
   real-time reliability factor, respectively. In addition, considering the
   transmitted data rises with the number of SUs increasing, we propose a
   rational mass distribution (RMD) approach to adjust evidence theory to
   binary hypothesis test in spectrum sensing context. As a consequence,
   both the data volume to be transmitted and the workload at data fusion
   center has been reduced. Simulation results have proved that the
   proposed scheme is effective and robust to defense against distinctive
   SSDF attack patterns.

AB recently, utilizing ICT is a key of success in every field of
   industries, and its importance is growing more and more. Typical example
   is introducing ERP software which assists decision making of
   stakeholders by providing data regarding running business such as supply
   chain, procurement, inventory, finance, product lifecycle, projects,
   human resources, and so on in an integrated form. Especially for
   manufactures, vertical integration of data from a plant floor to the ERP
   is highly desirable. However, in most the case the vertical data
   integration is implemented via some relational database. Database has to
   endorse ACID property for its nature, and the ACID property could be a
   burden to realize the vertical integration in "real-time" manner. We
   propose a data management scheme that all the data at the plant floor,
   which are mostly held on PLCs' (Programmable Logic Controller) memory,
   are reflected to the memory which is held in some machine nodes of a
   data center. It allows users to see whole picture of the plant floor,
   and enables both data modification from both the data center and from
   the PLCs in a real-time manner from anywhere in the world. We describe
   the implementation of the proposing data management scheme and discuss
   what operations from the data center to the factory are applicable,
   against the relatively high communication latency from the plant floor
   to the data center.

   suggested method is based on multi-agent approach with distributed
   knowledgeable agents. The dynamic model consists in the multi-agent
   resource conversion process model that supports multi-approach modeling,
   including discrete-event, agent-based, queuing systems. To substantiate
   suggested technical decision of the integration module existing message
   brokers were analyzed. The subject area ontology is presented. It is

AB The nature of operational data that is frequently updated, and the
   interest to reflect business environment alterations in the business
   analysis process to make operational decisions, need more than the
   typical data warehousing methodology for data integration. In this
   paper, therefore, we propose a new methodology to dynamically extract
   real-time data from various internal and external data sources
   passively, i.e. after receiving the decision making query. We propose a
   methodology to store and exchange intensional data (in AXML format) to
   activate and automate the integration of real-time data and updates.
   AXML database will be proposed as a structural metadata to integrate
   data from external data sources and manipulate external models for
   accurate decision making. Our approach should be seen as a
   complementary, not a replacement, for the data warehousing approach.

SO 2014 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE
DT Proceedings Paper
PD 2014
PY 2014
AB Prognosis refers to the production of bounded estimates for the
   remaining useful life (RUL) of a component or system. Robust prognosis
   within well defined uncertainty bounds promises the ability to lower
   system sustainment costs and improve maintenance decision making. In
   ideal scenarios, the degradation of many assets is predictable from
   measurements taken during operation. These measurements, accompanied by
   appropriate knowledge, have been successfully used with various
   prognostic trending and prediction techniques to estimate the remaining
   useful life. However, there are scenarios where changes in operating
   environment or emerging fault modes can alter the degradation path an
   asset takes and thus invalidate previous predictions. One approach to
   overcoming these challenges is to develop prognostic techniques
   sensitive to change, however this sensitivity must be traded for
   robustness to imperfect degradation measurements. As an alternative, we
   develop multiple predictors, each with differing properties so that
   multiple estimates can be made based on different possible scenarios. A
   data fusion architecture is presented that combines multiple prognostic
   techniques weighted by their individual prediction uncertainty for the
   remaining useful life of an asset. The architecture is based on the
   concept of an ensemble Kalman Filter with an adaptive error co-variance
   parameter. The parameter is updated in real-time with the prediction
   variances produced by the set of prognostic predictions. Using real
   civil aerospace data, the technique is demonstrated to provide an
   amalgamated estimate of RUL to a fleet management operator. The
   developed architecture provides improved decision support to fleet
   maintainers in comparison to existing single prognostic technique
   methods.

AB Rapid advancement in information technology is being leveraged in
   healthcare to develop many innovative systems for measuring and
   monitoring health to provide decision support. Clinical Decision Support
   Systems (CDSS) support clinical decision making by providing specific
   guidance based on clinical input and real-time patient physiological
   data. However, there is limited integration of the data from the devices
   into a unified clinical decision support infrastructure. Clinicians
   typically employ multiple devices and interfaces to access information
   from multiple sensors and many medical instrumentation alarms to monitor
   and understand patient health status often leading to severe information
   overload and alarm fatigue in healthcare providers. The paper proposes a
   data fusion-based decision support architecture that aims to reduce
   false alarms to prevent alarm fatigue and information overload in

AB Petroleum engineering is a complicated subject which involves
   multidisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, operators and managers
   to use real-time and historic data to perform modeling, interpretation,
   analysis and decision-making activities. During this process, some very
   crucial tasks come from how to effectively collect and manage the
   acquired datasets, how to efficiently provide data services, and how to
   control and assess data quality. In addition, heterogeneous sources and
   various types of the datasets make the process more complicated. To
   achieve effective data engineering, metadata is discussed in this paper.
   Furthermore, a comprehensive, extensible and operational metadata model
   is presented. The model is discussed from different perspectives.
   Conceptually, it is a metadata framework with four levels of
   abstraction. Logically, it characterizes a three-dimensional geological
   data map that interconnects geological entities on the plane and mounts
   data resources as sub-trees on the other dimension. Physically, it
   adopts a federated topology and supports distributed storage and
   management by virtual nodes mapping. Finally, how the metadata model
   works in data governance, collection, management, and service is
   illustrated.

AB In last decade, enterprises began to feel the necessity to have better
   access to information for decision making, through visibility at all
   times into activities at all levels of business. For this scope, emerged
   the discipline Business Intelligence (BI) which nowadays covers areas
   like data warehousing, data integration technologies, query, reporting,
   and analysis tools for fulfilling the requirements of better and
   controlled access to business information and processes. The Business
   Activity Monitoring(BAM) technologies can provide real-time business
   analysis and alerts on information from sources like Web services,
   message queues, etc. The present interest of this paper consists in
   identification of elements required for implementing a solution for help
   in their activity, small and medium Romanian enterprises.

AB During a crisis, emergency responders must rapidly integrate information
   from many separate sources to satisfy their role-specific needs and to
   make time-sensitive decisions. Responders currently receive this
   information through numerous software applications and face the
   challenge of integrating this heterogeneous data into an
   all-encompassing picture. Individual responders with distinct roles,
   such as police, fire, and EMS, often have very different information
   needs, but existing tools do not provide individual tailoring of
   workspaces to support this need. As responders communicate using text,
   voice, or other multimodal collaboration systems, important details can
   also be lost or become stale over time. This paper describes our
   approach to developing a Precision Information Environment (PIE) that:
   (1) streamlines access to multiple information resources by fusing
   heterogeneous information for presentation through a single access
   point; (2) supports role-tailorable understanding of the unified data
   sources through a flexible workspace; and (3) supports collaboration
   between teams of local and distributed responders by providing a work
   environment that allows teams to share and manipulate dynamic data
   sources in real time. We also describe our initial results from a
   usability evaluation of the system with subject matter experts.

   problem of coal-dust explosion limit reducing once the gas gathering
   occur, the explosion parameters were detected by multi-sensor and the
   information of dust, gas concentration and temperature from sensors were
   carried on fuzzy processing to be fused based on fuzzy information and
   fusion theory. The system can finish fusion computing and
   decision-making of various system parameters to realize the early

AB This paper presents the design and realisation of a low-cost automated
   internet geoinformation service, named Kingston Automated Geoinformation
   Service (KAGIS), that provides the United Kingdom's academic community
   with fully processed quasi-realistic GIS maps of spatial population
   distribution, known as dasymetric maps. The key innovative aspect of the
   service is that it undertakes spatio-temporal interpolation for census
   area statistics and enable users to overcome the difficulties associated
   with inconsistent boundaries used by different census events. It is
   designed and programmed to carry out live, on-demand online integration
   of Edinburgh University's geospatial data service (EDINA) and Manchester
   University's census data service (MIMAS), to automatically geoprocess
   and deliver digital dasymetric maps for any of 2001, 1991 and 1981
   census years and any area of interest at all census area levels in the
   United Kingdom as per user's request. The system is capable of
   automatically handling large GIS datasets in accordance with users
   issuing requests. The system unleashes a large amount of geospatial and
   census data held in these formerly isolated digital repositories and
   carries out all necessary data processing to generate the requested
   spatial information products in a novel workflow. The online data
   transmission, retrieval, integration, processing and generation of
   quasi-realistic spatial population (dasymetric) GIS maps at the English
   county level typically take 2 minutes.
   KAGIS enables census data special interest group in the UK's academic
   community to access and utilise this newly available geoprocessing
   service for a wide range of applications, such as analysing population
   changes over the time and undertaking fine resolution detailed spatial
   population estimation for planning at various scales and areas of
   interest. Online interactive selection of datasets and the entire
   procedure of online heterogeneous data integration, areal interpolation
   and data processing for dasymetric maps with ancillary landuse maps
   derived from remotely sensed imagery are automated to offer end users
   opportunities to simply follow a few instructive checkbox and
   button-clicking steps to obtain resultant digital dasymetric maps.
   The design of KAGIS adopts the service oriented design architecture to
   couple the latest web portal technology and ArcGIS Server technology to
   realise the new secure internet geoinformation service with a set of
   specially designed and coded geoprocessing programs performing coherent
   chained actions in a novel workflow and it is programmed as a novel
   stateful application to be able to provide the runtime online data
   integration, processing and resultant GIS map delivering service to
   concurrent internet users.
   Novel aspects of KAGIS include its operation as a new fully integrated
   service system that acts as an automated online integrator, data
   processor, e-content generator and secure service deliverer. The system
   innovatively carries out live, flawless, on-demand combination of
   formerly isolated geospatial and census data-only repositories and
   services according to user requests. The novel design of coherently
   chained modules and workflow enables fully automated processes for
   real-time digital data acquisition, real-time data processing for
   on-demand GIS model generation and service delivery.
   The whole and parts of the secure online service technology of KAGIS are
   generic and universally applicable in any countries in the world. With
   the process of globalisation and development, all countries have been
   and are undergoing significant development and change. The technology
   and know-how experience of KAGIS can assist any country in the world to
   develop its secure internet GIS services, integrating geographical
   information for specific decision making systems as well as providing
   low-cost and efficient ways to process and utilise existing geographical
   data for a multitude of purposes such as development planning.

AB Microwave images with high spatiotemporal resolution are essential for
   observing and predicting tropical cyclones (TCs), including TC
   positioning, intensity estimation, and detection of concentric eyewall.
   Nevertheless, the temporal resolution of tropical cyclone microwave
   (TCMW) images is limited due to satellite quantity and orbit
   constraints, presenting a challenging problem for TC disaster
   forecasting. This research suggests a multi-sensor data fusion approach,
   using high-temporal-resolution tropical cyclone infrared (TCIR) images
   to generate synthetic TCMW images, offering a solution to this data
   scarcity problem. In particular, we introduce a deep learning network
   based on the Vision Transformer (TCA-ViT) to translate TCIR images into
   TCMW images. This can be viewed as a form of synthetic data generation,
   enhancing the available information for decision-making. We integrate a
   phase-based physical guidance mechanism into the training process.
   Furthermore, we have developed a dataset of TC infrared-to-microwave
   image conversions (TCIR2MW) for training and testing the model.
   Experimental results demonstrate the method's capability in rapidly and
   accurately extracting key features of TCs. Leveraging techniques like
   Mask and Transfer Learning, it addresses the absence of TCMW images by
   generating MW images from IR images, thereby aiding downstream tasks
   like TC intensity and precipitation forecasting. This study introduces a
   novel approach to the field of TC image research, with the potential to
   advance deep learning in this direction and provide vital insights for
   real-time observation and prediction of global TCs. Our source code and
   data are publicly available online at https://github.com/kleenY/TCIR2MW.

AB To address the dynamic and uncertain challenges posed by climate
   variability, soil heterogeneity, water distribution, and other key
   factors in crop field production, intelligent decision support systems
   (IDSS) that integrate domain knowledge and multi-source data for
   irrigation, fertilization, pest and disease control, and field dynamic
   management, are of great importance in meeting modern agriculture's
   demands for high precision, efficiency, and sustainability. By
   encompassing the development stages, typical practices, and
   technological pathways in China and developed countries, this paper
   summarizes the representative progress in Internet of Things (IoT),
   multimodal fusion, knowledge representation, reinforcement learning,
   reasoning, and practical applications in IDSS. Prominent research
   challenges include the lack of real-time or near-real-time sensor data,
   static domain knowledge, poor multimodal decision-making capability,
   weak cross-field generalization, and various implementation barriers,
   such as a vague definition of data governance, high costs of service
   infrastructure, and low user acceptance intention. To overcome these
   challenges, future research should prioritize the development of
   scalable, dynamic, robust, interpretable, and trustworthy multimodal
   IDSS, promote the formulation of standards, and establish an open
   platform for seamless model deployment, thereby facilitating the
   transformation from experience-driven to intelligence-driven
   agricultural production paradigms.

AB Agriculture plays a pivotal role in Bangladesh's economy, yet farmers
   continue to struggle with resource optimization, soil health management,
   disease detection, and timely decision-making, all of which limit
   productivity and sustainability. Although prior research has attempted
   to address these issues using machine learning for crop yield
   prediction, soil analysis, and pest monitoring, most efforts remain
   fragmented, relying on small datasets and lacking integration of
   large-scale monitoring with field-level precision. To overcome these
   shortcomings, this paper introduces AGRO AI, a compact yet comprehensive
   web and mobile platform that integrates NASA satellite data for
   large-scale agricultural monitoring with real-time IoT sensor inputs
   capturing localized land conditions. By leveraging artificial
   intelligence, AGRO AI generates personalized recommendations for water
   resource management, soil quality assessment, crop and fertilizer
   selection, and early detection of diseases and pests, while also
   providing an AI-powered chatbot for continuous farmer support. The
   novelty of this research lies in its multi-source data fusion framework,
   which unifies macro- and micro-level insights to deliver real-time,
   actionable guidance. This unified approach enables the development of a
   scalable and integrated platform that improves recommendation accuracy
   beyond existing localized solutions while offering a farmer-centric
   interface adaptable to diverse agricultural contexts. Ultimately, AGRO
   AI enhances crop yields, reduces environmental impact, and contributes
   to food security and climate-resilient agriculture in Bangladesh.

AB Background: Emergency care is operationally defined as time-critical
   acute care across pre-hospital services, emergency departments, and
   critical care units (excluding routine urgent care and elective
   admissions), demanding rapid decision-making under pressure. Digital
   twin technology, creating real-time virtual replicas through continuous
   data integration, represents a transformative shift in managing acute
   conditions, resource allocation, and outcome prediction in emergency
   medicine. Aim: This review examines the current applications, benefits,
   challenges, and future directions of digital twin technology in
   emergency care and medicine, highlighting its potential to revolutionise
   emergency healthcare delivery. Method: A comprehensive narrative
   literature review was conducted using PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and
   Web of Science databases. Studies published between January 2015 and
   June 2025 focusing on digital twin applications in emergency
   departments, trauma care, critical care, and prehospital emergency
   services were included. Grey literature, conference proceedings, and
   technical reports were also reviewed to capture emerging developments.
   Results: Digital twins demonstrate significant utility across multiple
   emergency care domains including patient monitoring, resource
   allocation, workflow optimisation, predictive analytics, and training
   simulations. Key applications include real time patient condition
   prediction, emergency department capacity management, trauma response
   coordination, and personalised treatment planning. Despite promising
   outcomes, implementation challenges persist, including data integration
   complexities, computational requirements, and regulatory considerations.
   Conclusion: Digital twin technology holds substantial promise for
   enhancing emergency care delivery through improved decision support,
   resource optimisation, and predictive capabilities. Continued research,
   standardisation efforts, and interdisciplinary collaboration are
   essential for successful clinical integration and widespread adoption.

AB This study applied a Gaussian geostatistical simulation (GGS) to enhance
   the estimation of the annual average daily traffic (AADT) on low-volume
   roads in Montana. Traditional methods such as short-term traffic counts,
   regression models, manual counts, engineering judgment, seasonal
   adjustment factors, ratio estimation, and the growth factor method often
   oversimplify spatial patterns and fail to capture the variability and
   uncertainty inherent in sparse datasets. The GGS model provides a robust
   alternative by incorporating spatial autocorrelation to capture the
   relationships across locations. Its ability to generate stochastic
   realizations enables a more comprehensive representation of the complex
   traffic dynamics. This study used data from 2009 to 2016 for AADT
   thresholds ranging from 400 to 2,000 vehicles per day by applying
   advanced geostatistical techniques. The approach uses R Studio for
   variogram modeling, simulation, and spatial visualization to effectively
   analyze traffic patterns. The results validated the hypothesis that GGS
   enhances predictive precision and captures spatial variability, which is
   closely aligned with the simulated and measured AADT values. The
   analysis of the dataset from Montana showed increasing variability at
   higher AADT thresholds, while maintaining consistent alignment across
   metrics. This confirmed the reliability of the model under stable
   conditions. This study also identified limitations, including
   underestimation of variability in extreme traffic conditions. These
   findings highlight the potential of GGS to enhance transportation and
   infrastructure planning by effectively addressing spatial uncertainties.
   In addition, it can improve data collection strategies and support
   informed infrastructure development decisions. Future refinements, such
   as adaptive modeling and real-time data integration, may further enhance
   the utility of GGS for traffic management and decision-making.

AB In smart manufacturing systems, integrating artificial intelligence (AI)
   algorithms is essential for improving production efficiency,
   flexibility, and sustainability. Liquid Neural Networks (LNN) stand out
   as a groundbreaking paradigm, delivering unparalleled value through
   their dynamic adaptability, superior robustness to noise, and
   computational efficiency in processing high-frequency, non-stationary
   data streams characteristic of industrial environments. Unlike
   traditional models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are constrained by rigid
   architectures, high resource demands, and poor real-time responsiveness,
   LNN harnesses continuous-time dynamics and input-modulated time
   constants to solve these problems, enabling precise real-time
   decision-making and interpretable insights that drive proactive system
   optimization. This paper illustrates the transformative prospects of LNN
   across smart manufacturing layers, including LNN-enabled control for
   equipment control, manufacturing management for predictive maintenance
   and fault diagnosis, and business planning & logistics for demand
   forecasting and supply chain resilience. By addressing challenges in
   model training, data heterogeneity, and industrial integration, LNN
   unlocks real value: reduced downtime, enhanced resource utilization, and
   scalable AI deployment that fosters resilient, intelligent factories.
   Future directions emphasize lightweight designs, advanced data fusion,
   and hybrid architectures to fully realize LNN's potential in propelling
   Industry 5.0 innovations.

AB Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful AI tools capable
   of transforming how building information is collected, processed,
   analyzed, and applied across diverse research areas. Their capabilities
   can help building operators, facility managers and other stakeholders
   such as designers, architects and engineers by providing actionable
   insights for decision-making across planning, construction, operations,
   and maintenance of buildings and facilities. This paper explores ten key
   questions concerning the role of LLMs in shaping sustainable,
   intelligent, and human-centric buildings. From fundamental definitions
   to advanced applications, we examine how LLMs facilitate decision-making
   across the life cycle of buildings and energy systems. LLMs can enhance
   life cycle assessments (LCA), building energy simulations, and real-time
   data integration, empowering more efficient and adaptive human-AI
   environments. They can also contribute to streamlining regulatory
   compliance, improving post-occupancy evaluations, and fostering more
   inclusive and participatory design processes. Additionally, this paper
   addresses the ethical challenges posed by LLMs, such as bias, data
   privacy, and environmental impacts, and explores their potentials in
   advancing intelligent digital twins (DT) for ongoing building operations
   and maintenance. Built upon our applied research using LLMs and the
   review of tools, datasets, and research gaps, we provide a
   forward-looking perspective on how LLMs can drive innovation,
   collaboration, and productivity in the built environment while
   supporting ethical and effective implementation.

AB The increasing complexity of cancer diagnosis and treatment demands
   innovative, secure, and intelligent healthcare solutions. This study
   presents a quantum-inspired predictive healthcare system for
   personalised oncology that integrates multimodal data fusion with secure
   blockchain protocols. The proposed framework leverages genomic,
   clinical, imaging, and lifestyle data using advanced deep learning
   techniques and quantuminspired optimisation algorithms to improve early
   cancer prediction accuracy and enable personalised treatment strategies.
   A blockchain-based data governance layer is incorporated to ensure data
   integrity, privacy, and decentralised collaboration, facilitating
   secure, traceable, and transparent access control across hospitals,
   laboratories, and healthcare stakeholders. A novel multimodal feature
   fusion strategy is introduced to integrate heterogeneous data types
   effectively, enhancing the model's ability to generate individualised
   patient insights. The system utilises quantum-inspired algorithms, such
   as the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational
   Quantum Classifiers (VQC), to boost computational efficiency and reduce
   model convergence time. A hybrid edge-cloud deployment architecture
   supports scalable, low-latency, and energyefficient operation, enabling
   real-time clinical decision-making. Experimental validation across
   benchmark oncology datasets demonstrates that the proposed system
   outperforms conventional AI approaches in terms of prediction accuracy,
   inference speed, and data security. The results underline the potential
   of quantum-inspired artificial intelligence, combined with blockchain,
   to revolutionise personalised cancer care and provide a foundational
   model for next-generation clinical decision support systems.

AB Purpose Building information modeling (BIM) has transformed project and
   construction management through enhanced collaboration and digital
   integration. However, challenges persist in standardization,
   cross-platform compatibility and sustainable design. Existing literature
   lacks a systematic scientometric analysis focused on BIM'sevolution and
   emerging frontiers in project and construction management. Such analysis
   is essential for identifying knowledge gaps, revealing shifting
   technological integrations and informing future academic and industrial
   agendas. This study maps the intellectual structure of BIM research from
   2010 to 2024, with a focus on thematic trends, collaboration patterns
   and emerging directions to bridge knowledge gaps and support future
   advancements in project and construction management.
   Design/methodology/approach A scientometric review of 534 publications
   from the Web of Science (2010-2024) was conducted. Bibliometric
   techniques, CiteSpace and VOSviewer were employed to analyze publication
   trends, author/institutional collaborations, keyword co-occurrence
   networks and citation patterns. Future research directions were
   identified based on keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis,
   complemented by a review of highly cited publications. In addition,
   content analysis was used to interpret the integration of BIM with
   emerging technologies (e.g. IoT, digital twins) and implementation
   challenges. Findings BIM research has shifted from foundational 3D/4D
   modeling to lifecycle management, smart construction and emerging
   technologies (blockchain, AI, cloud computing). Key clusters include
   collaborative workflows, sustainability and digital twins. While BIM
   improves cost control and resource efficiency, critical gaps remain in
   standardization, interoperability and sustainable design integration.
   The study identifies under-researched areas, such as BIM-AR/VR synergy
   and blockchain for data security. Future research may focus on the
   integration of BIM with digital twin frameworks and advanced data fusion
   techniques to support lifecycle simulation, real-time decision-making
   and adaptive control in complex construction environments.
   Originality/value This study provides a focused scientometric review of
   BIM research (2010-2024) in the domain of project and construction
   management. It uniquely explores BIM'sintegration with emerging
   technologies and offers a structured roadmap for advancing digital
   transformation in construction.

AB With the development of the energy industry, the scale of inland oil and
   gas pipeline construction has continued to expand. However, safety
   hazards such as oil and gas leakage have also become prominent. Unlike
   marine oil spills, inland oil spills mostly occur in small water areas.
   Therefore, marine oil spill control technologies are often difficult to
   be directly applied to inland oil spill scenarios. In response to the
   real-time and intelligent requirements of oil and gas leakage monitoring
   in small water areas, this study designs an intelligent detection system
   based on ARM processing chips and Raspberry Pi. This system takes the
   ARM-PCB control board as the underlying controller, which is responsible
   for sensor data acquisition and equipment driving. The Raspberry Pi
   serves as the core processing unit, running Python algorithms to
   complete data fusion analysis, leakage determination, and GPS
   positioning. The alarm information and positioning coordinates are
   remotely transmitted through the wireless communication module, and a
   camera is equipped for on-site image collection and transmission,
   forming a closed-loop monitoring system of
   'perception-decision-making-early warning'. Tests have proved that the
   system can effectively adapt to complex hydrological environments,
   providing technical support for the intelligent detection of oil and gas
   leakage in water areas.

AB Floods and droughts represent two of the most widespread hydrological
   hazards, frequently leading to large-scale socioeconomic disruption and
   long-term environmental degradation. The increasing frequency and
   intensity of these hazards, driven by climate change and rapid
   urbanization, require advanced and timely response mechanisms.
   Geospatial technologies, particularly Earth Observation (EO), have
   become essential in this context, providing multi-scale, near-real-time
   information to support disaster management. This review synthesizes the
   current state of EO-based flood and drought management, with a specific
   focus on the operational integration of EO data and procedures across
   key response substages. It assesses the capabilities of core EO sensor
   families, including optical, thermal infrared, active and passive
   microwave, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), in monitoring
   critical hydrological and environmental variables. A central
   contribution of this study is the development of the Operational EO
   Integration Framework (OEI-F), which systematically aligns EO data
   types, integration approaches, spatial scales, and response substages
   within an operational context. The review further examines advances in
   multi-source data fusion, EO-derived indicators, and service-oriented
   platforms, while identifying persistent challenges related to data
   interoperability, institutional uptake, and compound hazard monitoring.
   The findings underscore the pivotal role of EO in strengthening climate
   adaptation, multi-hazard resilience, and evidence-based decision-making,
   and conclude with strategic recommendations to enhance its operational
   effectiveness across technological, organizational, and policy
   dimensions.

AB Real-world, unpredictable conditions for autonomous vehicles continue to
   be a challenge. This study presents a Python-developed "Redundancy Net"
   as a multi-model ensemble method in improving the autonomous vehicle
   systems in perception, decision making, fault tolerance, adaptability,
   and robustness. Evaluated with the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite, the
   framework was developed through the integration of stereoscopic cameras,
   LiDAR, GPS, and IMU data fusion with the implementation of hardware
   sensor fusion. For analysis, redundancy net data pre-processing sequence
   normalization, voxelization, Kalman filtering, and sequence temporal
   alignment, the multimodal systems. Redundancy net uses the complementary
   features of CNNs for spatial perception, LSTMs for sequence learning,
   and transformers for global spatio-temporal integration. In the
   redundancy and reliability layer, model predictions are dynamically
   fused with "confidence" based weighting through sensor faulted
   downgrades ensuring dependable outcomes. A fail-safe decision module
   with Monte Carlo dropout and entropy-based uncertainty evaluates system
   low confidence outcomes and activates safety holds. The Online
   Validation and Self-Adaptation mechanism improves and enhances
   Self-Adaptation mechanisms in real time by adjusting a model's
   parameters based on continuous performance evaluations and feedback. The
   experimental evaluations show that Redundancy Net provides a performance
   boost of 94.8% accuracy as compared to standalone CNN, LSTM, and
   Transformer models, which speaks to the framework's contribution to
   developing safe, flexible, and robust autonomous navigation in
   complicated driving environments.

AB Due to the complexity of the operating environment and the diversity of
   components, fault maintenance and detection of aircraft engines have
   always been a huge challenge. To improve the reliability and maintenance
   efficiency of aircraft engines, a multi-channel, multi-scale, and graph
   relational meta learning intelligent detection method is proposed. By
   combining multi-channel data fusion, multi-scale feature extraction,
   graph neural networks, and meta learning strategies, a comprehensive
   understanding of fault characteristics and their propagation
   relationships is achieved. In the research results, the proposed
   multi-channel, multi-scale, and graph relation meta learning intelligent
   detection method has better performance, with a localization accuracy of
   0.94 and an average localization error of 0.11. Meanwhile, its training
   time is 15.2 min, and inference time is 49.65 milliseconds,
   demonstrating high computational efficiency. In addition, the
   multi-channel multi-scale and graph relation meta learning intelligent
   detection method has shown good robustness under different testing
   conditions. The results show that this method not only has significant
   advantages in the accuracy and efficiency of fault detection, but also
   has excellent fault localization performance, significantly reducing the
   safety risks and economic losses caused by aircraft engine failures. The
   research provides a theoretical basis for real-time fault monitoring and

AB Background: Multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDTs) remain the foundation
   of gynecologic cancer management, yet increasing diagnostic complexity
   and rapidly evolving molecular classifications have intensified interest
   in artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential decision-support tool.
   This study aimed to evaluate the concordance between MDT-derived
   recommendations and those generated by ChatGPT 5.0 across a large,
   real-world cohort of gynecologic oncology cases. Methods: This
   single-center retrospective analysis included 599 consecutive patients
   with cervical, endometrial, ovarian, or vulvar cancer evaluated during
   MDT meetings over a 2-month period. Standardized anonymized case
   summaries were entered into ChatGPT 5.0, which was instructed to follow
   current ESGO guidelines. AI-generated staging and treatment
   recommendations were compared with MDT decisions. Discrepancies were
   independently assessed by two reviewers and stratified by malignancy
   type, disease stage, and treatment domain. Results: Overall concordance
   for FIGO staging was 77.0%, while treatment-related decisions
   demonstrated lower discordance, particularly in chemotherapy (8.2%) and
   targeted therapy (6.8%). The highest staging disagreement occurred in
   early-stage endometrial cancer (32.6%), reflecting the complexity of
   newly revised molecular classifications. In recurrent ovarian and
   cervical cancer, discrepancies were more pronounced in surgical and
   systemic therapy recommendations, suggesting limited AI capacity to
   integrate multimodal imaging, prior treatments, and individualized
   considerations. Vulvar cancer cases showed the highest overall
   agreement. Conclusions: ChatGPT 5.0 aligns with MDT decisions in many
   straightforward scenarios but falls short in complex or nuanced cases
   requiring contextual, multimodal, and patient-specific reasoning. These
   findings underscore the need for prospective, real-time evaluation,
   multimodal data integration, external validation, and explainable AI
   frameworks before LLMs can be safely incorporated into routine
   gynecologic oncology decision-making.

   human-machine interaction (HMI) into geographic information system (GIS)
   models. This study proposes a method that combines real-time data and
   automation to address the gaps in technology and urban planning. Current
   GIS models are ineffective because of limited real-time data
   integration, poor urban system interactions, and lack of adaptability to
   dynamic changes. These shortcomings hinder sustainable urban growth and
   lead to suboptimal planning and resource management. The proposed
   IoTbased framework for SD in HS (IoT-SD-HS) uses IoT devices and sensors
   to collect social, economic, and environmental data. These data enable
   adaptive decision-making, smart city planning, improved resource
   management, and enhanced urban resilience. Intuitive HMI interfaces
   enable stakeholders to work effectively within a framework, thereby
   facilitating data-driven decisions for urban planning and
   sustainability. The results demonstrate significant improvements in
   energy consumption, waste management, and infrastructure development.
   The IoT-SD-HS model achieved high urban resilience (96.12%), waste
   management efficiency (97.34%), and decision accuracy (98.12%) while
   reducing energy consumption by 10.12%. By continuously evaluating power
   distribution during peak hours, smart cities can reduce their carbon
   footprints and save costs, demonstrating superior performance compared

   which mainly comprises the physical layer, the simulation layer, the
   data layer, the model layer, and the service layer. In the framework,
   two key technologies are proposed. Firstly, to standardize the
   multi-source heterogeneous simulation data and sensor data, the
   load-response-coordinate data association model is created, laying the
   foundation for digital twin modeling. Secondly, the hierarchical
   multisource data fusion method is proposed to achieve the fusion of
   simulation data and sensor data, thereby establishing a digital twin
   model and realizing high overall precision as well as accurate
   interpolation at sensor local positions. To demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed digital twin modeling framework, two
   experimental studies on the open-hole plate and the hierarchical
   stiffened plate are carried out. Results indicate that the proposed
   framework can establish a high-precision digital twin model that ensures
   real-time monitoring and obtains better prediction and decision-making
   for the loading control, and provides an intelligent solution for
   full-field structural strength assessment and prediction.

AB In this study, we present an advanced fire detection approach using an
   improved weighted bounding box fusion technique based on Dempster-Shafer
   theory. A key challenge in fire detection is the inherent uncertainty in
   distinguishing true fire events from false positives (e.g., fire-like
   objects or background noise). Our approach addresses this by fusing
   overlapping bounding boxes from a You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based
   detector, explicitly modeling conflicts between fire and non-fire
   classifications. Dempster-Shafer theory plays a critical role in
   quantifying uncertainty and reconciling contradictory evidence, enabling
   more robust decision-making. We further introduce a confidence-aware
   weighting scheme to prioritize highly reliable detections during fusion.
   On a diverse fire image dataset, YOLOv5 combined with our
   Dempster-Shafer Weighted Boxes Fusion (DS-WBF) method achieved a
   precision of 0.814, recall of 0.863, AP0.5 of 0.875, and AP0.5-0.95 of
   0.542, representing gains of +1.24%, +1.17%, +2.46%, and +4.63% over
   traditional Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). These improvements reduce
   false alarms and enhance true positive rates, enabling more reliable
   early fire detection for real-time monitoring systems.

   decision-making layer is                provided with a signal
   processing unit for                pre-processing the elastic wave
   signal and                extracting characteristic information of      
   characteristic event type and intensity. A data                fusion
   unit fuses the characteristic information                with data of
   other environment sensing sensors on                the vehicle to
   generate a comprehensive environment                sensing result. A
   decision control unit identifies                a risk event according
   to the comprehensive                environment sensing result and
   generates a                corresponding grading response instruction.
   USE - Automobile intelligent safety protection and                escape
   system based on elastic wave sensor for use                in automobile
   electronic technology and active                safety field.
   ADVANTAGE - The system realizes omni-directional and               
   high-sensitivity sensing of the vehicle physical                contact
   risk (collision, scratch and water falling)                through the
   elastic wave sensor network, and makes                up the sensing
   blind area of the traditional                vision/radar sensor in the
   short-distance and                non-visual contact scene. The
   intelligent decision                layer integrates the signal
   processing, the data                fusion and the decision control, so
   that the system                can comprehensively judge based on the
   multi-source                information without depending on the single
   sensor                signal, which greatly improves the accuracy and

AB Traditional research on the quality monitoring of liberal arts talent
   training has problems such as a single evaluation dimension, a lack of a
   dynamic adjustment mechanism and a centralized decision-making body,
   which lead to limited monitoring results that cannot fully reflect the
   multi-faceted needs of students, thus affecting the continuous
   improvement of education quality. To this end, this paper develops a new
   quality monitoring system based on a multi-intelligent decision-making,
   which integrates information from multiple parties to achieve dynamic
   optimization. The system integrates multi-source data such as the
   student management system and teaching platform, and uses real-time data
   stream processing technology to monitor and analyze students' learning
   progress, classroom participation and other information. Based on this,
   the system employs a range of machine learning and optimization
   algorithms. Support vector machine (SVM) is utilized to predict
   students' learning patterns and provide a dynamic adjustment basis for
   teaching by analyzing students' historical learning data; the random
   forest algorithm is used to comprehensively evaluate students' academic
   performance and ability, improve prediction accuracy through ensemble
   learning and provide personalized feedback for teachers. Then, the
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to optimize
   students' learning paths and the choice of paths is continuously
   adjusted according to the learning progress; the genetic algorithm (GA)
   is utilized to further optimize the choice of learning paths. In
   addition, the system also combines dimensions such as social
   adaptability, innovation ability and interdisciplinary literacy and
   evaluates students' comprehensive quality by designing modules such as
   social practice, volunteer service and corporate internship. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the new system effectively
   improves the quality of liberal arts talent training. The experimental
   group's average final exam score is 82.5 points, which is significantly
   higher than the 75.4 points of the control group (p < 0 .05 ). There is
   also a significant improvement in innovation ability and
   interdisciplinary literacy, which effectively promotes the continuous
   improvement of education quality.

AB The analysis of monitoring data plays a critical role in dam safety
   assessment. The data analysis process typically involves three stages:
   monitoring point information inspection, single-point analysis and early
   warning, and multi-point data fusion and evaluation. A key challenge in
   the multi-point evaluation stage is establishing an objective and
   reproducible standard that effectively links multi-point information
   with the dam's structural behavior. For arch dams, the load-transfer
   system consists of horizontal arches and vertical girders. This study
   proposes an assessment system that utilizes three evaluation parameters:
   the alert level of individual monitoring points, the spatial correlation
   of alerted points, and the anomaly rate across all points. A
   deterministic correspondence is established between these parameters and
   the final score, thereby eliminating subjective judgment. The
   reliability of the evaluation results was verified using measured data
   and a typical case study. Furthermore, a digital twin (DT) platform was
   developed for managing, analyzing, and evaluating monitoring
   information. The proposed model was integrated into this platform. Both
   the monitoring data and the inferred dam behavior are visualized. This
   DT platform has been employed by a real arch dam in China. Operational
   results demonstrate its capability for integrated real-time analysis and
   presentation, significantly enhancing the intuitiveness of dam safety
   monitoring and the efficiency of decision-making.

AB Every country's ability to grow economically primarily depends on its
   agricultural production. Rapid population expansion, frequent climate
   change, and resource shortages make it difficult to meet the food needs
   of the current population. Precision agriculture has rapidly evolved
   with the integration of deep learning (DL) techniques, addressing key
   challenges such as crop selection, yield prediction, disease detection,
   pest management, and weed control. This systematic review provides a
   comprehensive analysis of recent advances in DL applications for
   agriculture, highlighting methodologies, models, and their impact on
   farm efficiency and sustainability. By reviewing 117 studies, we
   evaluate how DL models, including convolution neural networks (CNNs),
   recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM),
   Transformers, and other pre-trained models, are employed in tasks
   ranging from image-based disease identification to time series crop
   yield forecasting. Recent developments in large vision models (LVMs) and
   the rise of multi-models further enhance precision agriculture by
   automating complex tasks such as disease detection and crop health
   monitoring. These approaches address challenges like limited labeled
   data and dataset imbalances, providing scalable and reliable solutions.
   Despite their potential, DL models face challenges such as computational
   resource demands, generalization difficulties in diverse environments,
   and real-time scalability. Future research should prioritize hybrid DL
   models, integration with internet of things (IoT) systems, and transfer
   learning to overcome these limitations. Additionally, incorporating LVMs
   and multi-models with advanced data fusion techniques can further
   improve precision agriculture practices, enabling real-time
   decision-making, adaptability, and sustainability. This review offers
   insights into the current state and future directions of DL in precision
   agriculture, emphasizing its transformative potential in modern
   agriculture.

   capturing crop images. A soil-climate sensor                assembly
   measures soil moisture, pH, temperature                and nutrient
   levels. An edge-computing unit                executes a lightweight
   convolutional neural network                (CNN) for early stress
   classification. A                data-fusion engine combines normalized
   difference                vegetation index (NDVI) metrics, CNN-based
   stress                outputs and soil-climate parameters to generate a 
   compound stress index for real-time irrigation                control.
   The imaging module computes the NDVI from                captured images
   by extracting red and near-infrared                equivalent channels.
   The soil-climate sensor                assembly comprises capacitive
   moisture sensors,                ion-selective NPK electrodes, pH
   sensors, and                temperature sensors.

   thus ensuring low                latency, continuous functionality
   without internet,                and energy efficiency when powered
   through a                solar-battery system. The system provides a    
   dashboard that is hosted locally to allow farmers                to
   visualize trends, receive alerts, and manually                override

AB Genomic surveillance has emerged as a fundamental tool in the global
   response to dengue virus (DENV), enabling the rapid detection of viral
   strains, monitoring of transmission dynamics, and assessment of
   evolutionary changes that may impact disease control strategies. This
   chapter examines the critical role of genomic surveillance in addressing
   the ongoing dengue crisis, highlighting its contributions to outbreak
   detection, strain characterization, and vaccine efficacy assessments. We
   provide a comparative analysis of regional approaches to genomic
   surveillance, emphasizing disparities in infrastructure, sequencing
   capacity, and data-sharing frameworks across different epidemiological
   settings. Despite its transformative potential, the implementation of
   genomic surveillance faces significant challenges, including logistical
   constraints, limited sequencing accessibility in resource-limited
   settings, and issues related to data integration and public health
   decision-making. We discuss these barriers and propose strategies to
   enhance genomic surveillance efforts, such as strengthening
   international collaborations, fostering capacity-building initiatives,
   and integrating real-time sequencing technologies with epidemiological
   and ecological modeling. Finally, we explore future directions in
   genomic surveillance, advocating for a more coordinated and sustainable
   approach to genomic data generation and utilization, ultimately
   improving global preparedness and response to dengue and other emerging
   arboviruses.

AB Influenza's rapid evolution, driven by its segmented RNA genome, high
   mutation rate, and extensive animal reservoirs, underpins its capacity
   to cause recurring epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. Recent
   advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are
   transforming influenza forecasting by enabling the prediction of viral
   evolution and the optimisation of public health preparedness. This
   review synthesises insights from historical data (1890-2025) and
   contemporary research to examine the evolving role of AI in influenza
   prediction. It highlights major developments including transformer-based
   models for viral evolution, real-time integration of mobility and
   environmental data, hybrid quantum, which are classical algorithms, and
   multimodal data fusion frameworks, it also consideres critical risk
   modifiers such as meteorological variation, armed conflict, and host
   genetics. Importantly, the review distinguishes between retrospective,
   proof-of-concept analyses and prospective, real-time forecasting
   applications, clarifying their respective contributions to operational
   public health preparedness and informed decision-making.

AB The modern power systems face challenges, including high proportions of
   uncertain renewable energy, rapid dynamics of power electronics, and
   decentralized control among multiple entities. Digital development has
   enabled power grids to integrate numerous edge devices equipped with
   sensing and computing capabilities, aiming to exploit edge data to
   enhance grid observability, controllability, and resilience. However,
   much of potential value of edge data remains unexploited with
   traditional architecture and methods. Therefore, we explore the
   potential of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to fully exploit
   edge data in modern power systems. An intelligent, sealable, and
   efficient three-layer architecture is proposed to align the capabilities
   of LLMs with the constraints of edge scenarios. Supporting technologies
   are reviewed for each layer, including multimodal data fusion,
   lightweight collaborative inference, and closed-loop control. To
   validate the proposed architecture, we provide three representative
   scenarios for preliminary exploration: virtual power plant (VPP)
   dispatch, intelligent substation inspection, and contingency management,
   illustrating how LLMs can unlock the value of edge data. We conclude by
   identifying key technical challenges and outlining future research
   directions for building modern power systems by LLM-based exploitation
   of edge data.

AB Accurate growth stage recognition is vital for optimising crop inputs
   and improving yield efficiency. However, single-modal methods often fail
   to distinguish phenologically adjacent stages due to canopy similarity,
   spectral saturation, or structural ambiguity, leading to mistimed
   agronomic actions and resource loss. Moreover, the high computational
   demands of complex deep neural networks hinder practical implementation.
   To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal
   data fusion network for wheat growth stage recognition. Specifically,
   the RGB images, multispectral (MS) data, and digital surface model (DSM)
   acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), along with derived spectral
   vegetation index (VI), are used to capture multimodal canopy features,
   including colour, spectral reflectance, and spatial structure.
   Furthermore, the approach utilises MobileNetV3-Small, a lightweight
   convolutional neural network, as the backbone to construct the
   multimodal data fusion framework. This framework enables efficient
   feature extraction and integration, achieving precise and rapid wheat
   growth stage recognition with minimal computational overhead. The
   results demonstrate that, compared to single-modal models, the proposed
   multimodal fusion model significantly enhances growth stage recognition
   accuracy, achieving an accuracy of 99.57 %, a precision of 99.58 %, a
   recall of 99.57 %, and an F1 score of 99.57 %. Notably, it improves
   stage differentiation in critical transitions such as Booting to
   Heading, reducing field misclassification risks and supporting quick
   decision-making. Comparative analysis with MobileNetV3-Large, ResNet-18,
   MNASNet, EfficientNet-B0, and ConvNeXt-Tiny demonstrates that
   MobileNetV3Small offers the best trade-off between accuracy and resource
   efficiency, with only 1.53 M parameters and an inference time of 6.03 ms
   on RTX 4090 and 25.11 ms on Jetson Orin NX. This efficiency enables
   real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, such as
   onboard UAV processors or in-field embedded systems. Overall, this study
   effectively overcomes the challenges of recognising adjacent growth
   stages and computational constraints, offering a robust theoretical
   foundation and an efficient, accurate solution for wheat growth stage
   recognition.

   dynamically                personalizing digital content for
   applications                including electronic commerce platform,
   retail                environment, digital advertising, and consumer    
              research.
   ADVANTAGE - The system achieves superior accuracy in               
   predicting purchase intent compared to traditional               
   behavioral analytics by capturing subconscious                neural
   responses that precede conscious                decision-making,
   enabling unprecedented                personalization while maintaining
   user privacy                through federated learning architectures and
   anonymized data processing protocol. Implements               
   cross-modal correlation algorithms that identify               
   relationships between subconscious neural responses                and
   conscious psychological constructs, enabling                the system
   to validate self-reported psychometric                data against
   objective physiological measurements                while simultaneously
   enriching neural signal                interpretation with contextual
   psychological                frameworks. The integration resolves
   contradictions                between stated preferences and revealed
   neural                responses, detects deceptive or socially desirable
   survey responses, and generates consumer models                that
   capture both stable personality traits and                dynamic
   emotional states. The multi-stream                processing
   architecture enables the system to                predict purchase
   intent, product preference, and                abandonment risk before
   users complete                transactions, providing sufficient
   temporal                headroom for dynamic content personalization    
   interventions that can influence decision outcomes.               
   Provides privacy-preserving architecture                implementing
   federated learning protocols,                on-device processing, and
   differential privacy                mechanisms that enable collection of
   sensitive                neurophysiological and psychological data while
   maintaining user anonymity and preventing                unauthorized
   data access. The system processes raw                biometric signals
   locally on user devices,                extracting only high-level
   features and model                parameters that are transmitted to
   central servers                for aggregate learning, ensuring that
   personally                identifiable neural patterns never leave user 
   control. Secure multi-party computation protocols                enable
   collaborative model training across multiple               
   organizations without sharing underlying consumer                data,
   while homomorphic encryption allows                computation on
   encrypted data without decryption.                Differential privacy
   injection adds calibrated                noise to individual
   contributions, providing                mathematical guarantees that
   specific users cannot                be identified in aggregate datasets
   while                preserving overall statistical utility. Implements 
   dynamic content personalization capabilities that               
   automatically adapt product presentations, pricing               
   strategies, interface layouts, messaging tone, and               
   recommendation algorithms based on real-time               
   neuropsychometric state assessment to optimize                conversion
   rates and enhance user satisfaction.                Povides
   comprehensive model explainability and bias                detection
   mechanisms that enable transparent                operation of
   neuropsychometric prediction systems,                identify potential
   discriminatory patterns, and                generate human-interpretable
   explanations of                personalization decisions to satisfy
   ethical                guidelines and regulatory requirements.

AB Autonomous mobile robots have gained significant traction in various
   fields, such as industrial automation, logistics and healthcare, where
   they face complex challenges in dynamic indoor environments. The need
   for precise localization, while contending with obstacles, changing
   ambient conditions and real-time decision-making, makes localization an
   intricate task. This research presents a novel approach for enabling
   self-navigating indoor mobile robots. Unlike previous methods, this
   approach utilizes an advanced Constrained Extended Kalman Filter (CEKF)
   combined with a fuzzy-based adjustment mechanism to improve sensor data
   fusion. The robot employs a range of sensors, including odometry,
   Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), LIDAR and cameras, to accurately
   interpret its surroundings. The fuzzy-based CEKF dynamically adjusts the
   weight of sensor data based on the quality and reliability of the
   individual measurements, allowing the system to adapt to varying
   environmental conditions. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness
   of the proposed model, demonstrating a significant reduction in error
   compared to earlier models, improving the robot's localization accuracy.
   Additionally, different filters were tested and the optimal filter with
   the lowest error was identified, reinforcing the model's reliability.
   Simulation results demonstrate a significant reduction in error compared
   to earlier models, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.095, a Mean
   Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.095.
   Additionally, the results demonstrate that the fuzzy-based CEKF model
   outperforms conventional methods, including EKF, and shows reduced
   computational time compared to other filters, with an operation time of
   3s.

   as convolutional neural                networks or object detection
   models is provided for                precise identification of algal
   taxa associated                with bloom formation. The hyperspectral
   analysis                module is capable of classifying reflectance    
   spectra, detecting pigment-based absorption                features, and
   generating bloom-intensity maps                across spatial or
   temporal scales. The explainable                artificial intelligence
   framework integrates                hyperspectral reflectance data and
   microscopic                imaging for comprehensive detection,         
   identification, and mapping of harmful algal blooms               
   (HABs) in aquatic ecosystems. The accurate and               
   interpretable algal taxonomy are enabled. The                framework
   enables population density and bloom                severity estimation
   through regression analysis                using spectral and
   environmental inputs, thus                providing quantitative metrics
   of bloom intensity.                The fusion component combines output
   from spectral                classification and species detection into a
   unified                bloom probability index using weighted or        
   probabilistic evidence integration. The Bayesian                fusion
   and explainability layer unifies spectral                and visual
   model outputs to produce an                interpretable bloom
   probability index (BPI) with                confidence levels and
   wavelength-based SHAP feature                attributions. The decision
   visualization and                interpretability module highlights
   influential                spectral bands and image regions, thus
   facilitating                transparent and explainable predictions of
   bloom                events. The feedback and model refinement mechanism
   captures user validation and retraining inputs to               
   progressively improve system accuracy and                adaptability
   over time. The cloud-based monitoring                and visualization
   platform is capable of receiving                data from internet of
   things-enabled water quality                probes and laboratory
   imaging systems, thus                supporting real-time
   decision-making, automated                reporting, and risk
   visualization dashboards. The                proactive environmental
   management is advanced by                providing early bloom warnings,
   species-level                harmfulness confirmation, and transparent  
   artificial intelligence explanations that aid               
   researchers, environmental authorities, and                aquaculture
   operators in timely intervention and                control. The robust,
   scalable, and modular                framework suitable for real-time
   monitoring,                environmental management, and early warning
   of HAB                occurrences is delivered.

AB To reduce carbon emissions and minimize shipping costs, improving the
   fuel efficiency of ships is crucial. Various measures are taken to
   reduce the total fuel consumption of ships, including optimizing vessel
   parameters and selecting routes with the lowest fuel consumption.
   Different estimation methods are proposed for predicting fuel
   consumption, while various optimization methods are proposed to minimize
   fuel oil consumption. This paper provides a comprehensive review of
   methods for estimating and optimizing fuel oil consumption in maritime
   transport. Our novel contributions include categorizing fuel oil
   consumption and estimation methods into physics-based, Machine
   Learning,, and hybrid models, exploring their strengths and limitations.
   Furthermore, we highlight the importance of data fusion techniques,
   which combine AIS, onboard sensors, and meteorological data to enhance
   accuracy. We make the first attempt to discuss the emerging role of
   Explainable AI in enhancing model transparency for decision-making.
   Uniquely, key challenges, including data quality, availability, and the
   need for real-time optimization, are identified, and future research
   directions are proposed to address these gaps, with a focus on hybrid
   models, real-time optimization, and the standardization of datasets.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered robotic surgery is reshaping the
   surgical landscape by enhancing decision-making, precision, and patient
   safety in complex procedures. Despite its remarkable progress, current
   literature reveals critical gaps in interoperability, ethical
   governance, surgeon training, and real-time data integration between AI
   systems and human judgment. This study aims to examine how AI-powered
   robotic systems transform intraoperative decision-making and optimize
   surgical outcomes across minimally invasive, oncological, and cardiac
   operations. The review synthesizes quantitative insights from
   performance metrics and qualitative evaluations from clinical
   experiences, integrating multidisciplinary studies on intelligent
   robotics, augmented reality (AR), and machine learning in surgery.
   Comparative analysis highlights significant advancements in automation,
   preoperative planning, and intraoperative visualization, while revealing
   contradictions between human-centric adaptability and machine autonomy.
   Findings underscore that AI integration enhances surgical precision,
   reduces complication rates, and supports predictive analytics, yet faces
   limitations in ethical regulation, cost-effectiveness, and surgeon
   acceptance. Recommendations emphasize transparent algorithmic design,
   cross-specialty training, and collaborative frameworks between engineers
   and clinicians to ensure safe adoption. The implications extend to
   redefining surgical education, standardizing robotic protocols, and
   fostering patient-centered AI governance. Limitations include the narrow
   empirical scope and evolving regulatory landscape. Future research
   should explore adaptive AI learning models, global benchmarking, and
   equitable access to robotic technologies. Ultimately, AI-powered robotic
   surgery symbolizes a fundamental transformation toward data-driven,
   personalized, and ethically guided healthcare transformation.

AB Background Digital neurosurgery represents a transformative shift in
   modern neurosurgical practice, integrating advanced technologies, such
   as three-dimensional (3D) imaging, robotics, artificial intelligence
   (AI), and digital twin technology (DTT) models. These technologies offer
   innovative solutions for preoperative planning, intraoperative
   navigation, and postoperative management, with an emphasis on precision,
   personalization, and efficiency.Methods We conducted a scoping review in
   accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses-Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and guidance from
   the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis. PubMed,
   Web of Science (WOS), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)
   were searched without language or date limits through September 2025.
   Eligibility was structured using the Population-Concept-Context (PCC)
   framework. Two reviewers independently screened records in Rayyan with
   consensus resolution, and data were charted using a prepiloted form. A
   total of 133 sources were included and mapped.Results Key technologies
   reviewed include: (1) 3D reconstruction: Facilitates precise anatomical
   modeling, improving spatial understanding and surgical planning. (2) 3D
   printing (3DP): Enables creation of patient-specific models and surgical
   guides, enhancing preoperative simulation and intraoperative accuracy.
   (3) Digital twins (DT): Offers dynamic virtual models for real-time
   surgical simulation, training, and personalized patient management. (4)
   Intraoperative navigation: Utilizes advanced electromagnetic and
   AI-enhanced systems to improve tracking accuracy and reduce surgical
   errors. (5) Robotic-assisted surgery: Includes telesurgical,
   supervisory, and handheld systems that enhance precision and enable
   minimally invasive procedures. (6) AI: Supports image registration,
   subtask automation, and clinical decision-making, improving diagnostic
   and prognostic accuracy. These technologies demonstrate significant
   benefits in operative precision, patient outcomes, training efficacy,
   and interdisciplinary communication, though challenges remain in data
   integration, regulatory standards, and computational demands.Conclusion
   Positioning this study as a scoping review clarifies its objective to
   map technologies and applications across digital neurosurgery rather
   than to synthesize effect estimates, thereby providing an
   evidence-informed overview to guide future systematic evaluations.
   Digital neurosurgery is rapidly evolving toward greater integration of
   multimodal data, real-time adaptive systems, and AI-driven automation.
   Future developments should focus on standardizing regulatory frameworks,
   enhancing data fusion capabilities, and promoting interdisciplinary
   collaboration to fully realize the potential of digital technologies in
   advancing neurosurgical care.

AB As a major national strategic scientific challenge, deep geological
   engineering faces numerous technical hurdles, particularly in the
   detection and identification of adverse geological formations under
   complex stratigraphic conditions. With the advancement of
   next-generation information technologies like big data and artificial
   intelligence, multi-field collaborative detection technology has emerged
   as a pivotal direction for deep geological exploration. By integrating
   real-time multi-field data from drilling and heterogeneous multi-source
   information, this technology significantly enhances detection accuracy
   and efficiency, providing critical support for the safe and efficient
   advancement of deep geological projects. Currently, China still faces
   challenges in geological anomaly identification, including limited
   intelligent detection methods and insufficient data fusion capabilities,
   which constrain the deep implementation of deep geological engineering.
   Building on domestic and international research progress, this paper
   systematically analyzes the challenges and development trends in deep
   geological detection, focusing on three core scientific issues: the
   mechanism of real-time multi-field collaborative detection in complex
   geological formations, the development of integrated detection
   equipment, and multi-source heterogeneous data fusion with 3D
   tomographic imaging technology. Future trends indicate that multi-field
   collaborative detection mechanisms are evolving from single-parameter
   characterization to multi-field coupling and intelligent
   decision-making, while detection equipment is increasingly moving toward
   integration and intelligence. Overcoming these key technologies will
   drive systematic breakthroughs in China's deep geological exploration,
   achieving comprehensive progress from methodologies to equipment
   development.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a transformative
   tool capable of addressing critical challenges and improving outcomes in
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This paper demonstrates
   how machine learning and data fusion predict stem cell activity and
   potency, improve cellular characterization, and optimize therapeutic
   design. It also highlights important uses of AI in tissue engineering
   and cell-based therapeutics. By enabling accurate, non-invasive, and
   quantitative examination of living cells, AI also advances microscopy
   and imaging, facilitating better decision-making and real-time
   monitoring. Using search criteria including artificial intelligence,
   machine learning, deep learning, regenerative medicine, stem cells, and
   tissue engineering, the review was carried out using PubMed, Scopus, Web
   of Science, and Google Scholar. A total of 71 articles were screened; 8
   non-peer-reviewed sources, 5 conference abstracts, and 4 duplicates were
   excluded. The final dataset included 7 clinical studies, 6 preclinical
   investigations, 18 original research articles, and 23 review papers. AI
   techniques, datasets, performance indicators, and regeneration results
   were compiled in the extracted data. To summarize, AI speeds up the
   development of tissue engineering, minimizes trial-and-error
   experimentation, lowers research expenses, forecasts tissue
   interactions, and enhances scaffold and biomaterial design.
   Consequently, AI integration enhances stem cell-based treatments and
   regenerative approaches, underscoring the necessity of interdisciplinary
   cooperation and ongoing technical development.

AB Rapid industrialization, driven by scientific and technological
   advancements, has intensified environmental pollution and elevated
   health risks from hazardous chemicals. To mitigate these challenges,
   there is growing demand for chemical sensing technologies with high
   sensitivity and selectivity. Conventional methods, such as
   metal-oxide-based sensor technology and surface-enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (SERS), are constrained by limitations in either
   selectivity or quantification. This paper reviews recent developments in
   integrated multimodal sensing approaches, emphasizing combinations of
   sensing methods and their synergistic impact on detection performance
   toward chemical molecules, and proposes strategies for realizing ideal
   chemical sensing. Notable innovations, such as
   potentiometric-chemoresistive, chemoresistive-spectroscopic, and
   spectroscopicmechanical hybrid sensing systems have demonstrated
   significant improvements in sensitivity, selectivity, and quantitative
   accuracy. Despite these advancements, challenges such as
   cross-sensitivity and complex data interpretation persist. To address
   these, machine learning and AI-based analytics have emerged as effective
   tools to refine sensor outputs and enhance real-time decision-making.
   Future efforts will likely focus on the use of twodimensional materials
   for signal isolation, MEMS/NEMS-based miniaturization, and deep learning
   for complex data fusion. These advances promise to transform chemical
   sensing in various fields like environmental monitoring, healthcare, and
   industrial safety, bringing us closer to an ideal universal chemical
   sensor.

   improving the decision-making process, increasing resource use
   efficiency, and enhancing sustainability. Agricultural cybernetics (AC)
   integrates cyber-physical systems, data-driven approaches, information
   and communication technologies (ICT), and control theories to enhance
   agricultural operations. Here, we systematically review 140 studies
   (comprising 51 whole articles) that apply ML and OPT techniques for
   predictive modelling, resource management, and precision agriculture.
   This study adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocols and utilized a
   multidatabase search across Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, CrossRef,
   PubMed, and Science Direct. It was found that ML-based approaches (i.e.,
   supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning) are useful in
   areas such as yield prediction, disease detection, and soil health
   detection. Meanwhile, OPT algorithms (e.g., evolutionary and hybrid ML
   models) improve the operational efficiency and sustainability of
   Agricultural Systems. Despite these insights, issues such as data
   heterogeneity, computational feasibility, and ethical considerations
   regarding data privacy limit widespread acceptance. Emphasizing the need
   for standardized data, low-cost ML applications for smallholder farmers,
   and interdisciplinary collaboration. Future research should also focus
   on developing data integration features, implementing real-time data
   monitoring, and addressing socio-economic barriers to ML adoption for a
   sustainable and responsible solution in the agricultural sector.

AB Neonatal neurocritical care (NNCC) has emerged as a specialized
   discipline to address the unique neurological needs of critically ill
   newborns. However, disparities in access to brain-focused expertise and
   neuromonitoring technologies remain a significant global challenge.
   Remote NNCC, supported by telemedicine and digital health tools, offers
   a promising approach to extend specialized neurological care beyond
   tertiary centers, particularly to underserved or resource-limited
   settings. This review explores the current landscape, opportunities, and
   limitations of remote NNCC. Key applications include remote consulting
   and rounding, tele-interpretation of neurophysiological data,
   integration of multimodal monitoring, remote neuroimaging evaluation,
   and virtual neurological examinations. Additionally, telehealth
   platforms are increasingly used to support neurodevelopmental follow-up
   and therapeutic interventions after NICU discharge. These approaches can
   enhance diagnostic precision, enable timely intervention, reduce
   unnecessary transfers, and promote equity in care delivery. Advancements
   in artificial intelligence, immersive reality, and digital twins
   modeling may further expand the capabilities of remote NNCC. These
   emerging technologies hold the potential to optimize real-time
   decisionmaking, personalize interventions, and foster large-scale
   collaboration through cloud-based data integration. However, significant
   barriers remain, including limitations in infrastructure,
   interoperability between systems, variability in training, and ethical
   concerns related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, and equitable
   access. To ensure the safe and effective adoption of remote NNCC,
   standardized protocols, robust governance frameworks, and investments in
   workforce development and infrastructure are essential.
   Interdisciplinary collaboration and global partnerships will be critical
   in addressing these challenges and realizing the full potential of
   remote NNCC in improving neurological outcomes for high-risk neonates
   worldwide.

AB Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of critical
   components in industrial applications is essential for optimizing
   maintenance strategies and ensuring operational safety. Traditional
   methods often struggle with the complexities of real-time data
   integration and fail to provide uncertainty measures critical for
   high-stakes decision-making. This study introduces a novel deep learning
   framework that not only predicts RUL in real-time but also quantifies
   the uncertainty of these predictions, enhancing the reliability of the
   prognosis. To demonstrate this approach, neural network architectures
   were developed to understand real-time inputs of time-series type
   acoustic emission nondestructive evaluation data. The key innovation of
   the approach is the use of information entropy with window-analysis to
   analyze streaming data. The combination of window analysis and deep
   learning allows for autonomous analysis for the user. Furthermore, a
   digital thread was developed to predict RUL as data was streamed. To
   address the challenge of uncertainty, the model architectures
   incorporate Monte Carlo dropout, providing a probabilistic
   interpretation of the predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that
   the approach not only improves the accuracy of RUL estimates compared to
   traditional models but also offers meaningful uncertainty bounds which
   are vital for risk-averse industries.

   system comprises a hybrid dual-model framework for               
   integrating linear regression for determining                significant
   predictors of engagement and                classification analysis for
   detecting at-risk                learners based on multivariate
   academic,                behavioral, and demographic factors. The
   regression                module computes statistical influence of
   variables                including course design, feedback quality,     
   technology access, learning habits, and academic               
   performance, while a classification module predicts                the
   at-risk learners through supervised                machine-learning

   ADVANTAGE - The system enhances ability of digital               
   learning infrastructures to monitor engagement               
   continuously and improve overall student retention.                The
   dual-model architecture integrates                regression-based
   predictor analysis and                classification-based risk
   identification, thus                enabling both quantitative
   estimation of engagement                factors and real-time detection
   of at risk                learners. The system implements a
   multi-dimensional                engagement analysis mechanism that
   simultaneously                evaluates cognitive, emotional,
   behavioral, and                social domains to produce holistic
   engagement                insights for educational institutions. The    
   feature-importance and interpretability engine                identifies
   the relative influence of key variables                such as course
   design, feedback quality, technology                access, academic
   performance, and learning habits                on overall engagement
   levels. The dynamic data                integration and model updating
   mechanism is capable                of continuously learning from new
   institutional                datasets, thus ensuring consistent accuracy
   and                adaptability across varied educational               
   environments. The system designs a real-time                monitoring
   and intervention module that issues                automated alerts and
   adaptive recommendations to                educators when engagement
   levels fall below                threshold values. The visual dashboard
   interface                graphically represents engagement scores,
   predictor                impacts, and classification outputs for
   educators                and administrators, thus improving transparency
   and                decision support. The system implements a secure     
   and scalable architecture capable of handling large               
   volumes of academic and behavioral data, while               
   maintaining data confidentiality and compliance                with
   educational privacy regulations. The system                allows a
   generalizable predictive model applicable                across online,
   blended, and institutional learning                platforms without
   requiring domain-specific                retraining. The system improves
   educational quality                and learner outcomes by enabling
   early detection of                disengagement, targeted pedagogical
   adjustments,                and evidence-based academic management
   through                intelligent analytics.

AB Reliable interpretation of physiological time series is crucial for
   expert systems supporting decision-making in critical care, especially
   for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, high-frequency
   medical data streams-such as intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms-often
   suffer from substantial missing data in the intensive care unit (ICU),
   compromising real-time monitoring and treatment decisions. Conventional
   imputation methods prioritize statistical accuracy but frequently
   overlook clinical relevance, limiting their utility in critical care
   settings. We proposed a Parallel Imputation Diffusion Model (PIDM)
   designed to handle high-missing-rate medical time series with
   physiological relevance. PIDM employs a diffusion-based framework to
   learn data distributions and generate clinically meaningful imputations.
   The method incorporates overlapping segmentation and Dynamic Programming
   Alignment (DPA) to ensure smooth transitions between imputed segments
   while efficiently handling long sequences. A novel Clinical Relevance
   Curve (CRC) metric is introduced to evaluate imputation quality based on
   domain specific physiological parameters rather than conventional
   statistical errors. PIDM was evaluated on high-resolution ICP waveform
   data from TBI patients. Compared to existing state-of-theart methods,
   PIDM demonstrated superior performance in both statistical measures and
   clinical relevance metrics. The model also showed high computational
   efficiency, making it suitable for integration into real-time ICU
   monitoring systems. In conclusion, PIDM offers a clinically informed,
   efficient solution for imputing missing physiological data in the ICU.
   By ensuring both numerical accuracy and physiological plausibility, PIDM
   enhances the reliability of ICU data and supports critical
   decision-making. This approach can serve as a foundation for broader
   applications in multimodal ICU data integration and real-time clinical
   decision support.

AB The management of oncology drugs is inherently complex, facing
   challenges such as high development costs, prolonged timelines, and
   substantial inter-patient heterogeneity. Recent advances in artificial
   intelligence (AI) have introduced transformative capabilities across the
   entire cancer drug lifecycle-from target discovery and compound
   screening to clinical trial optimization, individualized therapy,
   toxicity management, supply chain logistics, and regulatory oversight.
   AI enables precise target identification, accelerates virtual drug
   screening and molecular design, and enhances clinical trial efficiency
   through intelligent patient stratification and adaptive protocols.
   Moreover, AI facilitates personalized treatment decision-making, early
   prediction of drug resistance, and real-time toxicity surveillance,
   while improving pharmacovigilance and post-market drug evaluation using
   real-world data. Here, "post-market drug evaluation" refers to
   real-world effectiveness and safety assessment using spontaneous reports
   (e.g., FAERS/VigiBase) and EHR/claims-based outcomes, rather than
   cost-effectiveness analyses. Examples include EHR-NLP to surface
   immune-related adverse events, AI-assisted trial recruitment and
   adaptive designs, and individualized dosing frameworks (e.g.,
   CURATE.AI). Despite its enormous promise, AI-driven oncology drug
   management faces notable challenges in data integration, model
   interpretability, clinical translation, fairness, and regulatory
   governance. This review comprehensively summarizes the current
   applications of AI in oncology pharmacology, highlights key
   opportunities and barriers, and explores future directions at the
   intersection of AI, precision medicine, and cancer therapeutics. Future
   priorities include prospective multi-site evaluations, fairness
   auditing, and continuous post-market algorithmovigilance.

AB Digital twin (DT) technology is revolutionizing the construction
   industry by enhancing project performance, predictive maintenance, and
   resource management via real-time data integration and virtual
   simulation. Despite its latent potential, successful DT implementation
   in construction projects requires an understanding of critical success
   factors (CSFs) that support effective deployment and integration. A
   bibliometric study was conducted after extracting 89 articles from the
   Scopus database to achieve such an understanding. Subsequently, a
   systematic approach was performed to synthesize the extant literature
   and identify the CSFs, knowledge gaps, and future research directions.
   Emergent findings indicate a growing number of published research
   articles on CSFs for DT implementation, underscoring exponential
   interest in the technology throughout the scientific community and
   industry. Moreover, significantly influential articles and the
   quintessential role of geographic collaboration were recognized.
   Finally, the following four knowledge gaps were emphasized: (1) DT
   integration with emerging technologies, (2) lifecycle management and
   sustainability integration with the DT, (3) human-centric factors and
   stakeholder collaboration for DT decision making, and (4) policy and
   regulatory framework for DT implementation. This research serves as the
   first study to employ a state-of-the-art review that would provide
   scholars and practitioners with an extensive understanding of successful
   DT implementation in construction projects. This research would enhance
   digital innovation in the construction industry by implementing CSFs for
   DT adoption and offer actionable recommendations for industry
   practitioners who seek to augment their digital transition.

AB Objective Space-based information support is a core component of modern
   operational systems. It acquires, transmits, and processes information
   through space-based platforms to provide full-process, round-the-clock
   information support for remote precision strikes. Therefore, digital
   simulation and verification of space-based information support systems
   have become key means for combat concept design, scheme demonstration,
   and rapid capability iteration. This study examines the application of
   Model-Based Systems Engineering(MBSE) to integrated simulation of
   space-based support operations. The objective is to address key
   challenges in information representation, system interoperability, and
   integrated simulation in complex combat systems. To overcome the
   limitations of traditional simulation approaches in cross-platform
   collaboration, dynamic extensibility, and efficient integration of
   functional logic with spatiotemporal information, a multi-perspective
   modeling and simulation method based on the Discrete EVent System
   specification(DEVS) is proposed. A hybrid integrated simulation
   framework is constructed. Methods The proposed framework enables
   abstract interconnection of weapon and equipment models, plug-and-play
   integration of simulation resources, precise global time
   synchronization, and high-performance realtime communication. These
   capabilities are achieved through four core modules: data integration
   management, heterogeneous software adapters, time management control,
   and publish-subscribe mechanisms. The framework supports
   interoperability and reusability of heterogeneous simulation software.
   On this basis, a joint simulation system is designed by integrating
   system architecture development and verification software with
   spatiotemporal simulation software for visualization and reasoning.
   Message middleware supports bidirectional synchronous interaction
   between state machines and spatiotemporal models, enabling closed-loop
   verification from combat concepts to digital inference. The core
   contribution of this research is the removal of long-standing separation
   between discrete event logic describing combat functions, information
   flow, and state machines, typically modeled using Systems Modeling
   Language (SysML), and continuous physical scenes, such as spatiotemporal
   motion and sensor coverage, constructed on visualization and deduction
   platforms. Through real-time bidirectional data exchange enabled by
   message middleware, discrete command decisions drive continuous platform
   behavior, whereas dynamic changes in battlefield conditions trigger
   corresponding combat responses. Results and Discussions A complete
   closed-loop simulation of a "maritime island and reef reconnaissance
   support denial operation" scenario is conducted using the joint
   simulation system, producing effective verification results. The
   simulation reproduces the full process from space-based target detection
   to coordinated regional denial by multi-domain forces. First, a
   capability-activity-equipment analysis model for the combat mission is
   developed using the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF), generating
   equipment interaction relationships and corresponding state machines. In
   parallel, continuous construction of the combat scenario is implemented
   on the visualization and deduction platform. The entire deduction
   process is precisely synchronized with physical motion through the state
   machine model deployed in the system architecture development and
   verification platform.
   Each state transition, such as "target detection," "strike initiation,"
   and "effect evaluation," triggers corresponding spatiotemporal
   simulation activities. Platform states and environmental data fed back
   from the visualization and deduction platform then drive subsequent
   state machine evolution. Through joint simulation, the rationality and
   feasibility of the operational concept, in which multi-domain unmanned
   forces conduct reconnaissance, deterrence, and denial under space-based
   information support, are verified. The results provide an intuitive and
   high-confidence basis for decision-making in system scheme optimization.
   Conclusions This study investigates the application of model-driven
   technology to the design and validation of space-based support joint
   operation systems. A joint simulation framework enabling deep
   integration of functional logic and physical scenarios is constructed
   and validated. Unlike conventional simulation approaches that focus on
   static structures or isolated functions, the proposed framework couples
   SysML-based discrete event logic models with continuous spatiotemporal
   dynamic models through a distributed architecture consisting of one core
   platform and multiple component adapters. This approach resolves the
   long-standing separation between functional modeling and scene
   simulation. Discrete behaviors, such as command decision-making and
   state transitions, directly drive platform movement and interaction
   within realistic spatiotemporal environments. Conversely, dynamic
   battlefield changes provide real-time feedback that affects higher-level
   logical decisions, forming a bidirectional closed loop. The framework
   integrates the precision of functional logic with the intuitiveness of
   scene simulation and enables realistic reproduction of multi-domain
   collaborative operations in digital space. It provides effective support
   for system design, operational deduction, and high-confidence
   verification of space-based support joint operation systems.

AB Data in power grid digital operation exhibit multisource heterogeneous
   characteristics, resulting in low integration efficiency and slow
   anomaly detection response. To address this, this paper proposes a
   method for power grid digital operation data integration based on
   K-medoids clustering. The basic service layer utilizes an Field
   Programmable Gate Array parallel architecture. This enables
   millisecond-level synchronous acquisition and dynamic preprocessing of
   multisource data, such as mechanical vibration, partial discharge
   signals, and temperature. The implementation is based on the analysis of
   the power grid digital operation structure. The data are then fed back
   to the cloud service layer, which, through business integration
   services, data analysis, and data access services, performs data
   filtering and analysis. Subsequently, the data are input to the
   application layer via the database server. The application layer employs
   a K-medoids clustering method that introduces a density-weighted
   Euclidean distance metric and an adaptive centroid selection strategy,
   significantly enhancing the clustering performance of multisource data.
   In particular, the proposed architecture supports real-time data
   processing and can be extended to cross-modal scenarios, including
   integration with speech-to-text systems in power grid monitoring. By
   aligning with low-latency neural network principles, this method
   facilitates timely decision-making in intelligent operation
   environments. Experiments confirm the method's efficacy. It acquires and
   integrates multisource heterogeneous power grid digital operation data
   effectively. The data throughput of different power grid digital
   operation data sources all exceed 110 MB/s. The silhouette coefficient
   of the integrated data sets is greater than 0.91, indicating that the
   integration of power grid digital operation data using this method
   exhibits good separability and reliability, enabling rapid detection of
   data anomalies within the power grid, thus laying a solid foundation for
   the operation and maintenance management of power grid digital
   operation.

   becoming increasingly effective tools for spectrum monitoring and
   building situational awareness in the electromagnetic environment. The
   proposed system architecture enables scalability and adaptive solutions
   for electromagnetic spectrum monitoring in cognitive radio
   applications.Abstract The rapid expansion of wireless communications has
   led to increasing demand and interference in the electromagnetic
   spectrum, raising the question of how to achieve reliable and adaptive
   monitoring in complex and dynamic environments. This study aims to
   investigate whether groups of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can
   provide an effective alternative to conventional, static spectrum
   monitoring systems. We propose a cooperative monitoring system in which
   multiple UAVs, integrated with software-defined radios (SDRs), conduct
   energy measurements and share their observations with a data fusion
   center. The fusion process is based on Dempster-Shafer theory (DST),
   which models uncertainty and combines partial or conflicting data from
   spatially distributed sensors. A simulation environment developed in
   MATLAB emulates UAV mobility, communication delays, and propagation
   effects in various swarm formations and environmental conditions. The
   results confirm that cooperative spectrum monitoring using UAVs with DST
   data fusion improves detection robustness and reduces susceptibility to
   noise and interference compared to single-sensor approaches. Even under
   challenging propagation conditions, the system maintains reliable
   performance, and DST fusion provides decision-supporting results. The
   proposed methodology demonstrates that UAV groups can serve as scalable,
   adaptive tools for real-time spectrum monitoring and contributes to the
   development of intelligent monitoring architectures in cognitive radio
   networks.

   USE - System for use in high stakes decision-making               
   domain such as clinical diagnostics in healthcare,                credit
   risk assessment in finance and threat                analysis in
   autonomous navigation system for                providing adaptive
   multi-modal data fusion and                bias-resilient predictive
   analytics.
   ADVANTAGE - The system provides a framework for               
   integrating heterogeneous data streams-such as                images,
   text and sensor data-into a unified,                semantically
   coherent representation. The system is                designed to
   dynamically adjust the contribution of                each modality
   based on real-time relevance and data                quality using a
   cross-modal attention mechanism,                which ensures that the
   fused representation is                robust, comprehensive and
   optimally configured for                high-accuracy predictive tasks.
   The system                continuously monitors the latent space        
   representation and model outputs for statistical                biases
   against protected attributes. To achieve                this, the system
   implements an adversarial                debiasing sub-network and a
   continuous                re-calibration module. The mechanism allows
   the                system to correct for pre-existing biases and        
   adapts to concept drift and emergent biases, thus               
   ensuring that the predictive outcomes remain fair                and
   equitable over the system operational lifetime                and a
   significant advancement over static offline                auditing
   tools.

AB The fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) has transformed
   manufacturing by integrating machines, materials, and human inputs
   through advanced operational and information technologies. This
   transformation has likewise reshaped nondestructive evaluation (NDE),
   giving rise to NDE 4.0. This new paradigm is enabled by key technologies
   such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), digital twins (DTs), automation,
   smart/cognitive sensors, and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
   These technologies enhance quality assurance, streamline workflows,
   enable real-time data-driven decision-making, and facilitate intelligent
   asset management. While NDE 4.0 is continuously transforming traditional
   practices, critical sectors such as aerospace, energy, and biomedical
   imaging still rely on conventional NDE methods, which struggle with
   scalability, data silos, and insufficient real-time analytics. To
   address these gaps, this paper offers a comprehensive strategic review
   and a forward-looking roadmap for advancing NDE 4.0 toward NDE 5.0. It
   synthesizes state-of-the-art developments while proposing a data-centric
   framework that integrates evolving DT technologies (from static to
   dynamic multi-tiered systems), autonomous inspection platforms, and
   hybrid data-fusion methods. Practical deployment challenges such as
   workforce skill gaps, cybersecurity, sustainability, and regulatory
   standardization, are examined alongside transformative emerging
   technologies such as terahertz sensing, quantum techniques, robotics and
   drones, augmented and virtual reality-assisted frameworks, blockchain,
   and big-data analytics. Recognizing the importance of ethical AI and
   open-science principles, this study advocates for a cohesive, globally
   standardized approach to accelerate NDE 4.0 adoption. Looking ahead,
   this work envisions NDE 5.0 as a synergistic human-machine ecosystem
   featuring self-learning, autonomous inspection systems that deliver
   enhanced reliability, safety, and efficiency across industries.

AB Stress has been identified as a significant factor leading to fish
   mortality, resulting in substantial economic losses. Therefore, there is
   an urgent need to develop a real-time and accurate decision-making
   system for detecting fish stress levels. Existing stress classification
   models for live fish primarily rely on traditional machine learning
   techniques for feature-level fusion of multimodal data, but they
   overlook the temporal dynamics within modalities and the nonlinear
   correlations between modalities. To overcome the limitations of
   traditional methods, this study designs a wearable sensor-based decision
   support system for non-destructive and real-time classification of live
   fish stress. Specifically, we propose a multimodal network
   (Respiratory-Environmental-Impedancenetwork, abbreviated as REI-net)
   based on a cross-fusion long short-term memory (Cross_LSTM) module and a
   deep feature fusion module, achieving deep integration and feature
   extraction of multi-source respiratory (RF, RI), impedance (IM, P), and
   environmental (T, RH) data. Unlike conventional LSTM, the Cross_LSTM
   module introduces connections between respiratory and impedance
   modalities at each time step, simultaneously capturing temporal dynamics
   within modalities and interactions between modalities, thereby forming a
   novel modality fusion approach. The 1D-CNN module further extracts and
   optimizes deep features, which are then fused with environmental
   modality features extracted by fully connected layers, enhancing the
   model's generalization ability and robustness. To validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were
   conducted on a dataset collected under controlled conditions. The
   results demonstrate that REI-net outperforms state-of-the-art models,
   achieving an accuracy of 96.59 %. This method contributes to real-time
   monitoring and management of sturgeon stress levels and provides
   decision support for relevant personnel. The code and data have been

AB This paper presents advanced methodologies for real-time terrain
   analysis and mapping in autonomous robotic systems. The focus is on
   appearance-based terrain traversability analysis and geometric-based
   terrain traceability analysis. In the appearance-based approach, an
   enhanced segmentation model using pixel-based augmentation and 13 unique

   are projected onto a 2.5D map by transforming two-dimensional image data
   into a three-dimensional coordinate system. The geometric-based approach
   involves depth estimation from stereo cameras, employing three Zed-2
   cameras and the Depth Sensing application programming interface. The
   research contributes to improved perception and decision-making
   capabilities of autonomous robots operating in complex and dynamic

   of 29 solution-oriented documents, the research applies both
   bibliometric and in-depth content analysis to identify methodological
   patterns. Co-occurrence mapping revealed four thematic clusters-Data
   Integration and User-Centric Analysis, Advanced 3D Spatial Analysis and
   Processing, Real-Time Interaction and Digital Twin Support, and 3D
   Visualization-each corresponding to distinct stages in a digital
   workflow, from data acquisition to interactive communication.
   Comparative and interdependency analyses demonstrated that these

   Integration forming the foundation for analysis, simulation, and
   visualization tasks. While current solutions are robust within
   individual stages, they remain fragmented, indicating a need for
   systemic interoperability. The findings underscore the opportunity to
   develop integrated digital platforms that synthesize these clusters,
   enabling more comprehensive observation, management, and planning of the
   built environment. Such integration could strengthen decision-making
   frameworks, enhance public participation, and advance sustainable, smart

AB With the rapid development of the new power system, the complexity of
   distribution network operation has put forward higher requirements for
   the real-time, accuracy, and intelligence of production command.
   Traditional decision-making systems have bottlenecks in heterogeneous
   data fusion, human-computer interaction efficiency, and decision-making
   science. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes an
   intelligent decision-making system for distribution network production
   enhanced by large language models (LLMs). The core contributions of this
   system are as follows: (1) A three-layer heterogeneous intelligent
   architecture integrating perception, cognition, and execution is
   constructed to realize the complete process from multimodal data input
   to closed-loop control; (2) An LLM-driven multimodal fusion and
   interaction mechanism is designed to uniformly encode unstructured
   information such as SCADA time-series data, on-site images, and voice
   commands into high-dimensional semantic features, realizing the
   comprehensiveness of situation awareness (SA) and the naturalness of
   human-computer interaction; (3) A multi-agent collaborative
   decision-making framework based on the improved contract net protocol
   (CNP) is proposed. The command intelligent agent empowered by the LLM
   decomposes and schedules complex tasks, driving each professional
   intelligent agent to perform parallel optimization. The system is
   verified in a typical distribution network fault handling scenario. The
   results show that compared with the traditional manual method, the
   proposed system reduces the end-to-end decision-making time from more
   than 30min to within 4min, with a reduction rate of more than 85%; the
   comprehensive accuracy rate of its fault location and recovery strategy
   reaches more than 98%, and the generated recovery strategy is
   significantly superior to the static rule-based expert system in terms
   of safety and economy. This research provides an innovative paradigm and
   technical path for the in-depth application of large model technology in
   the field of power critical infrastructure.

AB The Digital Twin (DT) model within a Digital Twin System (DTS) serves as
   a real-time digital representation of its corresponding physical entity.
   It is a dynamic, interconnected model that enables real-time
   optimization in its application environment, allowing for the
   simulation, monitoring, evaluation, and control of the physical
   counterpart's state and behavior while facilitating data-driven
   decision-making. In engineering practice, most scholars focus on data
   visualization and twin system construction. However, a complete digital
   twin system not only requires numerical representation of the real-time
   state of the physical entity but also sometimes requires real-time
   mechanical behavior analysis of the physical entity. Thus, a robust
   mechanical analysis module becomes essential within the DTS framework.
   Integrating a general-purpose mechanical analysis platform into the DTS
   offers an effective solution, thereby necessitating the development of
   novel fusion techniques for multi-source heterogeneous data. This study
   takes the integration of the Midas Civil mechanical analysis platform
   with a digital twin system as an example. By utilizing the API provided
   by Midas Civil, we develop a synchronization technique for
   virtual-physical systems, capable of handling and modeling multi-source
   heterogeneous data. This enables real-time mechanical computation and
   analysis within the DTS, facilitating the dynamic updating and
   aggregation of both simulation data from mechanical analysis and
   monitoring data from the physical entity. Consequently, the digital twin
   system can predict mechanical behaviors in the virtual domain, providing
   a more accurate representation of the real-world physical system's state
   and dynamics.

AB Sports-related injuries present significant challenges in diagnosis,
   prevention, and rehabilitation, often requiring precise assessments
   across multiple imaging modalities. Traditional diagnostic approaches
   rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to
   variability. To address these limitations, we propose an AI-driven
   framework integrating deep learning, biomechanical modeling, and
   adaptive decision-making for injury prediction and rehabilitation
   optimization. The Biomechanically-Informed Neural Network (BINN) fuses
   kinematic, physiological, and performance data using attention
   mechanisms, enhancing both interpretability and predictive accuracy.
   BINN processes motion capture data through convolutional and recurrent
   layers, extracting meaningful biomechanical patterns to assess movement
   efficiency and injury risk. The Adaptive Sports Medicine Strategy (ASMS)
   dynamically adjusts injury risk predictions and rehabilitation
   strategies in real-time by continuously integrating new physiological
   and biomechanical data. By leveraging self-attention and multimodal data
   fusion, ASMS optimizes athlete monitoring and intervention planning.
   Experimental results across multiple datasets, including CamVid,
   MSRA10K, DUT-OMRON, and NYU Depth V2. The proposed framework not only
   enhances injury risk assessment but also provides personalized
   rehabilitation recommendations, ensuring optimal recovery and
   performance. This study highlights the potential of AI-driven sports
   medicine, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and
   responsive injury management systems.

AB This study provides a systematic review of the application of
   Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods in passenger
   transportation. Analyzing 74 studies published between 2009 and 2025,
   the review classifies research based on transportation modes,
   methodological approaches, and sustainability dimensions. The findings
   reveal an increasing preference for fuzzy-based MCDM methods such as
   Fuzzy-AHP, TOPSIS, VIKOR, and DEMATEL to manage uncertainties in complex
   decision problems. Although sustainability principles are included in
   many studies, only a minority treat sustainability as the primary focus.
   The literature emphasizes service quality evaluation, passenger
   satisfaction, and system efficiency, with notable gaps in comprehensive
   sustainabilityfocused models and underexplored domains like maritime
   passenger safety. Keyword and research area analyses confirm the
   interdisciplinary nature of the field, linking transportation with
   engineering, computer science, environmental sciences, and economics.
   The study concludes with specific future research directions, including
   user-friendly hybrid MCDM frameworks, real-time data integration, and
   expanded focus on social and environmental sustainability. These
   recommendations aim to guide researchers and practitioners toward more
   inclusive, practical, and sustainable transportation decision-making
   models.

AB A modernized healthcare environment is possibly fuelled by the
   collaborative nature of Blockchain Technology (BT) and the Internet of
   Medical Things (IoMT), which guarantees efficient management,
   scalability, ledger optimization, and security. However, the huge volume
   of data created and the heterogeneous potential of IoMT devices make it
   difficult to achieve trustworthy execution as well as effective
   transaction management and organization. Using cutting-edge Machine
   Learning (ML) algorithms, like Lightweight Artificial Neural Networks
   (LANNs) with BT, this paper proposes an optimised multi-source data
   fusion framework that improves data integrity, real-time
   decision-making, efficiency, and scalability in an IoMT application
   environment. In order to assure accuracy and relevance, the data fusion
   mechanism merges multi-modal data from several IoMT devices. This
   enables the application of advanced fusion techniques, including Kalman
   Filtering enabled feature extraction. This guarantees the blockchain
   network processes only high-quality, pre-validated data. In addition,
   for secure transaction processing, the proposed architecture includes a
   trusted execution environment, guaranteeing data privacy and
   reliability. The proposed solution is good for resource-constrained IoMT
   contexts since it uses a hybrid consensus mechanism and clever data
   aggregation to reduce latency and computational cost. Comparing
   experimental results to classical blockchain-IoMT techniques, data
   accuracy, transaction throughput, and application security all show
   notable improvements of up to 98.33%, 97.98%, and 2.34%, respectively.
   Through the resolution of significant implementation constraints in
   blockchain transaction management and multi-source data fusion, this
   research offers a solid approach for developing IoMT ecosystems.

AB Crop growth models (CGMs) are essential tools for simulating plant
   growth, optimizing management, and supporting climate-resilient
   agriculture, yet selecting appropriate models and ensuring accurate
   predictions remain challenging due to data limitations, model structure
   constraints, and diverse agroecological conditions. This narrative
   review synthesizes CGM development, applications, and limitations,
   emphasizing systematic model selection, calibration, and validation to
   enhance prediction reliability, alongside best practices in sensitivity
   analysis, uncertainty assessment, and data integration. A major focus is
   on model integration and coupling, linking CGMs with hydrological,
   climate, economic, and spatial models to capture complex biophysical and
   socio-economic interactions, while multi-model approaches; including
   ensembles, modular frameworks, and cross-model comparisons, address
   single-model limitations, improve predictive reliability, and enable
   scenariobased analyses. Emerging technologies such as remote sensing,
   real-time sensors, AI, and digital twins further enhance adaptive
   modeling, automated calibration, and actionable decision support,
   supporting sustainable management, informing climate adaptation, and
   enabling evidence-based policy development. By combining systematic
   model selection, model coupling, and technological innovations, this
   review provides a roadmap for advancing CGMs toward more comprehensive,
   accurate, and actionable simulations, bridging the gap between modeling
   science and practical agricultural decision-making.

AB The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-particularly Natural
   Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs)-is
   revolutionizing materials science and laser-based manufacturing by
   automating alloy discovery, optimizing process parameters, and
   predicting mechanical performance with unprecedented accuracy. This
   review presents a comprehensive analysis of how transformer-based models
   (e.g., BERT, GPT, MatBERT, SciBERT) are applied to extract
   structure-property-processing (SPP) relationships from unstructured
   materials literature and technical data. By bridging domain-specific
   language models with traditional multiscale modeling techniques, this
   study proposes a novel computational framework that accelerates alloy
   design, enhances process optimization, and supports real-time
   decision-making in smart manufacturing environments. Key applications
   include inverse design, zero-shot/few-shot learning, knowledge graph
   construction, and multimodal data fusion for predicting material
   behavior under diverse processing conditions. Unlike previous studies
   that address NLP and computational modeling in isolation, this review
   emphasizes their convergence to reduce experimental cost, improve data
   curation, and enable adaptive manufacturing workflows. Through selected
   case studies, we demonstrate the role of LLMs as intelligent co-pilots
   for autonomous material innovation. This work establishes a foundational
   roadmap for integrating AI-driven materials informatics into
   next-generation manufacturing systems, promoting scalable, explainable,
   and data-driven solutions across alloy engineering, additive
   manufacturing, and materials discovery.

AB Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are central to spatial evidence in
   Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). In this review, GIS is used in a
   broad, integrative sense to refer to an ecosystem of geospatial
   technologies-such as remote sensing (RS) and GPS-where GIS serves as the
   core platform for managing, analyzing, and communicating spatial data
   throughout the EIA process. GIS plays a crucial role at each stage of
   EIA, from baseline data collection to spatial analysis, ecological
   sensitivity mapping, impact prediction, scenario simulation, and
   landscape connectivity assessment. These capabilities support
   alternatives analysis, risk communication, and decision-making in EIA.
   This paper synthesizes thematic evidence and presents case studies to
   illustrate the synergies between GIS, remote sensing, GeoAI, and
   multisource data fusion. It highlights operational workflows and key
   deliverables for EIA applications, including urban expansion, transport
   corridors, and protected-area management. We identify persistent
   challenges in data quality and standardization, interoperability, model
   uncertainty, and policy gaps. To address them, we propose a minimum
   geospatial dataset with clear metadata standards, interpretable GeoAI
   paired with formal sensitivity analysis, IoT-GIS pipelines for real-time
   monitoring and adaptive management, and the systematic inclusion of
   cumulative effects and climate scenarios. By linking GIS methods to
   typical decision points and reporting standards in EIA, this review
   clarifies where GIS adds value, how to quantify and communicate
   uncertainty, and how to align analytical outputs with regulatory
   requirements and stakeholder expectations. The study offers a practical
   framework and implementation checklist for standardized, transparent,
   and reproducible EIA processes, contributing to evidence-based
   ecological governance.

   module and temporal convolutional network module                built

   deployment, dynamically                scales up or down based on

AB This paper addresses three critical challenges in urban traffic digital
   twin systems: (1) achieving high-fidelity multi-source data fusion, (2)
   overcoming computational bottlenecks in large-scale real-time traffic
   simulation, and (3) enabling intuitive dynamic interaction for enhanced
   decision-making. To this end, we propose and implement a novel
   Unity-based digital twin system with a three-layer architecture. This
   architecture comprises: (1) a System Construction Layer integrating
   Google Maps, BlenderGIS, and CityEngine via Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) fusion to
   generate sub-meter accuracy 3D models (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) <=
   0.15m) with parametric Computer Generated Architecture (CGA) road
   editing; (2) a Data Acquisition Layer synchronizing Amap Application
   Programming Interface (API) traffic flow and OpenWeatherMap weather data
   to drive real-time environmental responses (e.g., rain particles = API
   intensity x 80); and (3) a Concept Generation Layer implementing an
   optimized 3-Degrees of Freedom (3-DoF) vehicle dynamics model with
   linear tire stiffness. Key innovations include Graphics Processing Unit
   (GPU)-accelerated collision detection (Unity Physics), an adaptive Level
   of Detail (LOD) strategy for 1,500-vehicle concurrent simulation at 60
   Frames Per Second (FPS), and closed-loop decision feedback. Validated on
   an i7-13700H/RTX 4060 platform, the system reduces Central Processing
   Unit (CPU)/GPU utilization by 47%/48% versus nonlinear models while
   maintaining trajectory error < 0.23m (9.5%) in 80 km/h emergency
   scenarios. Comprehensive comparative experiments confirm its efficacy,
   providing crucial technical support for smart traffic management,
   autonomous driving testing, and policy pre-evaluation.

   significant challenges due to waiting times, resource shortages, and
   increasing demand for services. The combination of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) and simulation is emerging as a promising solution to
   optimise healthcare processes, although their joint application remains
   limited. This systematic review analyses current methodological
   approaches that integrate both technologies to enhance healthcare
   management. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and
   IEEE Xplore for articles published between 2014 and 2025, following
   PRISMA guidelines. The search strategy included terms related to AI,
   simulation, and healthcare management, and was supplemented by a
   "snowball" search. Original studies describing combined applications of
   AI and simulation in healthcare processes were included. Results: Out of
   2506 records identified, 22 studies were selected for final analysis,
   most of which were published between 2021 and 2025, indicating growing
   interest in the field. The studies show that integrating AI and
   simulation has the potential to improve the efficiency of healthcare
   management, optimise resource allocation, and reduce waiting times,
   particularly in areas such as emergency departments and clinical
   pathways. Supervised learning algorithms, discrete event simulation
   (DES), and agent-based systems (ABS) were the most commonly used
   approaches. Conclusions: The combination of AI and simulation is an
   emerging field with great potential to revolutionise the management of
   healthcare processes.
   However, effective implementation requires overcoming technological,
   standardisation, and data integration barriers, as well as expanding its
   application to more hospital departments to maximise its impact.

AB With the advancement of intelligent manufacturing, CNC systems are
   increasingly expected to achieve higher levels of autonomous perception
   and decision-making. However, conventional CNC systems relying only on
   sensors have limited online analysis capability in complex machining.
   STEP-CNC, equipped with a simulation kernel, provides rich semantic
   information and enables multi-domain data fusion of "simulation +
   sensing", offering a novel framework for online process analysis. Taking
   tool wear as a case study, this paper proposes a comprehensive online
   monitoring solution integrated into STEP-CNC. First, the geometric
   simulation is executed to calculate the Cutter Workpiece Engagement
   (CWE) and quantify instantaneous material removal, effectively
   characterizing interactions with workpiece. Second, a sparse stacked
   autoencoder extracts and compresses informative features from
   multi-sensor signals, yielding compact representations correlated with
   wear value. Third, an incremental prediction model tailored for online
   applications is developed, fusing geometric, physical, and
   process-domain inputs to provide precise wear increment estimates over
   fixed time windows. Finally, the prediction model is encapsulated as a
   service and integrated within the STEP-CNC framework, enabling tool wear
   monitoring with online feedback to the CNC controller. Experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately track tool
   wear progression, achieving an online monitoring accuracy exceeding 89%.
   The monitored wear values can further assist machining decision-making,
   preventing tool failures and ensuring workpiece quality. The proposed
   method may also serve as an actionable reference for using STEP-CNC with
   multi-domain data in intelligent manufacturing applications.

AB Deforestation continues to pose a major threat to global ecosystems,
   biodiversity, and climate resilience, demanding intelligent and timely
   monitoring solutions. This study introduces a novel framework that
   integrates YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection with
   LangChain-based Agentic AI for real-time deforestation anomaly
   detection. The proposed system leverages YOLOv8's rapid and accurate
   visual recognition of deforestation indicators-such as tree stumps,
   logging machinery, and unauthorized human presence-while enhancing
   contextual reasoning and decision-making through LangChain agents.
   Extensive experiments using annotated satellite and drone imagery
   demonstrate steady improvements in training performance, with box_loss,
   cls_loss, and distribution focal loss reduced by more than 50%. Despite
   modest mean Average Precision (mAP500.07), the integration of LangChain
   agents enabled dynamic threshold adjustment,
   reinforcement-learning-based feedback, and GIS-driven reporting, thereby
   reducing false positives and increasing recall (up to 24%) compared to
   baseline YOLO models. The framework not only provides actionable,
   geolocated alerts but also supports adaptive learning for evolving
   deforestation patterns. By combining the speed of deep learning with the
   autonomy of agentic AI, this work highlights a scalable, interpretable,
   and real-time approach for environmental monitoring. The findings
   establish a foundation for future research in multi-modal data fusion,
   edge deployment on drones and satellites, and sustainable forest
   management.

AB The integration of cutting-edge technologies like IoT, blockchain,
   artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed precision environmental
   management by making it safe, scalable and effective. The study tackles
   the urgent problem of a fragmented, inefficient, and wasteful
   environmental monitoring and management system in urban greening, and
   agriculture. Many of the existing monitoring and management systems lack
   interoperability, responsiveness in the field in real-time,
   responsiveness to data security, and reactivity to environmental
   conditions. To address these challenges, the work illustrates a unified
   and smart framework that applies IoT, blockchain, and AIto support
   autonomously altered, secure, and efficient management of ecosystems.
   The most significant goals are to provide more data security, decision
   automation, and maximizing resource utilization. Smart contracts are
   used to automate tasks like irrigation and regulating the temperature to
   deliver fast and accurate response. Scalability and versatility of the
   framework is illustrated in the application of the framework in various
   environments. Most significant results show significant enhancements in
   both efficiency and sustainability. The model reduced water and energy
   consumption by 30 % and vegetation health indices by 15 %. The
   blockchain integration guaranteed data integrity and zero tampering
   while AI-powered analytics decreased response times to less than one
   second. These findings reveal the model's potential to revolutionize
   resource allocation in smart cities and agriculture. The major
   contribution of this work is establishing and verifying an integrated
   IoT-blockchain-AI framework, which provides not just a secure and
   real-time control of environmental monitoring and management, while
   demonstrating improved efficiency, sustainability, and scalability.

AB Highlights What are the main findings? A framework for detecting surface
   targets based on LiDAR and camera fusion is proposed. Data fusion is
   achieved through an external matrix to overcome the limitations of
   single-sensor systems, while sky-sea boundary detection eliminates
   water-surface noise. The approach is subsequently validated in
   real-world aquatic environments. An innovative two-stage clustering
   method based on point cloud distribution features is designed. Utilising
   adaptive thresholds and elliptical heat zones, it effectively resolves
   false detections caused by intermingled target and background point
   clouds. The designed saliency segmentation yields precise target
   contours. What are the implications of the main findings? This
   framework, grounded in explicit physical and geometric principles,
   requires no extensive annotated datasets and remains independent of
   specific data distributions. It maintains stable performance across
   uncharted water bodies and under varying illumination or weather
   conditions, delivering a highly robust obstacle detection solution for
   unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) navigating complex aquatic
   environments. The fusion strategy and two-stage clustering method
   balance detection speed and accuracy, effectively separating closely
   interleaved surface targets. This significantly enhances the
   environmental adaptability and decision reliability of unmanned surface
   systems.Highlights What are the main findings? A framework for detecting
   surface targets based on LiDAR and camera fusion is proposed. Data
   fusion is achieved through an external matrix to overcome the
   limitations of single-sensor systems, while sky-sea boundary detection
   eliminates water-surface noise. The approach is subsequently validated
   in real-world aquatic environments. An innovative two-stage clustering
   method based on point cloud distribution features is designed. Utilising
   adaptive thresholds and elliptical heat zones, it effectively resolves
   false detections caused by intermingled target and background point
   clouds. The designed saliency segmentation yields precise target
   contours. What are the implications of the main findings? This
   framework, grounded in explicit physical and geometric principles,
   requires no extensive annotated datasets and remains independent of
   specific data distributions. It maintains stable performance across
   uncharted water bodies and under varying illumination or weather
   conditions, delivering a highly robust obstacle detection solution for
   unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) navigating complex aquatic
   environments. The fusion strategy and two-stage clustering method
   balance detection speed and accuracy, effectively separating closely
   interleaved surface targets. This significantly enhances the
   environmental adaptability and decision reliability of unmanned surface
   systems.Abstract Unmanned surface vessels may encounter unknown surface
   obstacles when sailing. Accurate detection has a significant impact on
   the subsequent decision-making process. In order to deal with the
   complex water environment, this paper proposes an object detection
   framework based on the fusion of LiDAR and camera. The detection
   framework can achieve real-time and accurate water surface object
   detection without training, and has strong anti-interference ability.
   The detection framework achieves the data fusion of LiDAR and camera
   through external calibration and then uses the detection algorithm of
   sky-sea boundary (SSB) to establish a clear search area for LiDAR.
   Then, a two-stage clustering algorithm based on point cloud attributes
   and distribution information achieves more accurate segmentation. The
   region of interest (RoI) is obtained from the detection results by image
   projection. Finally, the region of interest is finely segmented by the
   saliency object detection algorithm. The experimental results show the
   effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm.

AB To address the critical challenges of decision-making delays and
   accuracy deficiencies faced by tourism enterprises in dynamic
   environments, this study develops an intelligent decision support
   platform based on multi-source heterogeneous data fusion. The research
   proposes a novel hybrid data fusion algorithm that integrates weighted
   averaging, Bayesian inference, and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory,
   establishing a comprehensive framework for processing three types of
   heterogeneous data from diverse sources. The main theoretical
   contributions include: (1) a hybrid data fusion algorithm achieving
   superior accuracy through adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms, (2) a
   multi-dimensional environmental adaptability assessment framework
   tailored for tourism enterprises, and (3) real-time decision
   optimization models with self-learning capabilities. Empirical
   validation across three different types of tourism enterprises
   demonstrates significant improvements in decision accuracy (18.96%
   average increase), response time reduction (78.4%), and environmental
   adaptability enhancement across market responsiveness, risk prediction,
   and resource optimization dimensions. The results indicate substantial
   cost-benefit ratios (3.4:1) and sustained competitive advantages,
   validating the platform's effectiveness for tourism enterprise digital
   transformation and strategic decision-making in volatile business
   environments.

AB Eating disorders are complex mental health conditions with significant
   morbidity and mortality, and a rising prevalence in children and
   adolescents. Despite global research and clinical efforts to improve
   outcomes, establishing routine, longitudinal data collection that
   facilitates individualised care in real-time and outcome assessment
   across clinical cohorts is crucial. The Royal Children's Hospital Eating
   Disorders Service have developed a world-first evaluation program that
   is integrated into the electronic medical record in a paediatric
   setting, capturing demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment
   outcomes of young people receiving care over time. The design can be
   scaled across services to expand the dataset and enable comparisons of
   treatment modalities and subgroup outcomes - improving clinical decision
   making and, enabling longitudinal data collection, and facilitating
   national and international collaboration.

AB With the rapid development of smart manufacturing and IoT technologies,
   traditional rule-based automation faces significant challenges in
   multi-source data integration, real-time decision-making, and
   cross-device coordination. This study proposes a novel dynamic
   manufacturing environment framework based on a decentralized Multi-Agent
   System (MAS-DME) that uniquely combines multi-agent architectures with
   hierarchical reinforcement learning. MAS-DME consists of two core
   agents: (1) an Equipment Control Agent leveraging Double Deep Q-Network
   (Double DQN) for real-time equipment state monitoring and adaptive
   control, and (2) a Resource Allocation Agent employing hierarchical
   reinforcement learning for dynamic and flexible resource scheduling. To
   validate the proposed work, comparative experiments against current
   production control methods were conducted by evaluating several critical
   performance indicators, including production efficiency, resource
   utilization, equipment failure response time, and product quality.
   Comparative experiments against existing production control methods
   demonstrate that MAS-DME significantly enhances production efficiency,
   optimizes resource utilization, and substantially reduces equipment
   failure response times. This research not only advances the theoretical
   foundations of dynamic process optimization in smart manufacturing but
   also offers practical pathways for future applications, including
   intelligent supply chain management and adaptive industrial automation.

   Real-time aggregation and decision-making: The multi-task fusion
   algorithm allows for stable and adaptive driver distraction
   classification, reducing false positives and improving response
   accuracy.Abstract Distracted driving continues to be a major contributor
   to road accidents, highlighting the growing research interest in
   advanced driver monitoring systems for enhanced safety. This paper seeks
   to improve the overall performance and effectiveness of such systems by
   highlighting the importance of recognizing the driver's activity. This
   paper introduces a novel methodology for assessing driver attention by
   using multi-perspective information using videos that capture the full
   driver body, hands, and face and focusing on three driver tasks:
   distracted actions, gaze direction, and hands-on-wheel monitoring. The
   experimental evaluation was conducted in two phases: first, assessing
   driver distracted activities, gaze direction, and hands-on-wheel using a
   CNN-based model and videos from three cameras that were placed inside
   the vehicle, and second, evaluating the multi-task fusion algorithm,
   considering the aggregated danger score, which was introduced in this
   paper, as a representation of the driver's attentiveness based on the
   multi-task data fusion algorithm. The proposed methodology was built and
   evaluated using a DMD dataset; additionally, model robustness was tested
   on the AUC_V2 and SAMDD driver distraction datasets. The proposed
   algorithm effectively combines multi-task information from different
   perspectives and evaluates the attention level of the driver.

AB Health data science serves as a transformative bridge between healthcare
   and technology, enabling data-driven decision-making, personalised
   medicine, and more effective public health interventions. This study
   presents a comprehensive investigation into advanced techniques such as
   machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), predictive
   analytics, and data visualisation, emphasising their applications in
   oncology, diabetes management, radiology, cardiology, and public health.
   High-quality datasets-sourced from electronic health records (EHRs),
   national health surveys, and clinical trial databases-were rigorously
   preprocessed to ensure accuracy and reliability. The interdisciplinary
   approach integrates expertise from computer science, statistics,
   biomedical engineering, and clinical medicine to foster cross-sector
   collaboration. Real-world case studies demonstrate measurable benefits,
   including up to a 20% improvement in early cancer detection accuracy
   using predictive models, a 15% reduction in diagnostic errors via
   AI-assisted radiology, and enhanced personalised treatment pathways for
   chronic disease management. The findings underscore Health Data
   Science's role in evidence-based policy-making, illustrated by
   data-driven strategies for pandemic response planning. Ethical and
   security considerations are addressed through compliance with the
   General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), alongside emerging concerns
   over cyber risks, transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI
   systems. Limitations such as data integration challenges and
   institutional resistance are discussed, with proposed solutions. Future
   research directions include real-time data processing, improved
   interoperability with EHR systems, and broader deployment of predictive
   models to enhance patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

AB The integration of consumer electronics into connected healthcare
   requires secure, explainable, and low-latency data management. Existing
   solutions often fail to scale or adapt under variable network
   conditions, exposing weaknesses in data integrity, processing, and fault
   recovery for next-generation systems. This paper presents DASHES, an
   autonomous framework that secures and optimizes end-to-end data handling
   while integrating consumer devices into healthcare networks. The
   framework combines: (i) a quantum-resistant blockchain using
   lattice-based cryptography for decentralized validation and integrity;
   (ii) bio-signal quantum encryption to protect physiological data against
   quantum-capable adversaries; (iii) an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
   system with evolutionary optimization for explainable, real-time
   decision-making; (iv) a self-healing mesh for fault-tolerant
   connectivity; and (v) a holographic data transmission pipeline for
   bandwidth-efficient, low-latency transport. Simulation studies on the
   MIMIC-III dataset under diverse stressors report an encryption success
   rate of 98.5%, fault detection accuracy of 98.5%, and mean recovery time
   of 3.2 s. End-to-end latency spans 12-29 ms across load and failure
   scenarios, and throughput reaches 1.2 GB/s under ideal conditions (1.0
   GB/s during scaling; 0.7 GB/s with node failures).

AB Highlights What are the main findings? A comprehensive evaluation of
   multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and mi-crowave sensors,
   undertaken individually and in combination, shows how LFMC and fuel
   types can be monitored with specific applicability to New Zealand. The
   review clarifies trade-offs (resolution, cadence, spectral sensitivity),
   outlines limitations and identifies opportunities to improve mapping of
   LFMC and fuel type. What are the implications of the main findings? The
   synthesis provides the technical groundwork for an operational,
   near-real-time LFMC prediction system in New Zealand with relevance to
   other fire-prone regions. Such a system will enable more reliable,
   timely wildfire risk assessment and strengthen decision-making for fire

   fuel moisture content (LFMC) is a critical variable influencing wildfire
   behavior, ignition potential, and suppression difficulty, yet it remains
   challenging to monitor consistently across landscapes due to sparse
   field observations, rapid temporal changes, and vegetation
   heterogeneity. This study presents a comprehensive review of
   satellite-based approaches for estimating LFMC, with emphasis on methods
   applicable to New Zealand, where wildfire risk is increasing due to
   climate change. We assess the suitability of different remote sensing
   data sources, including multispectral, thermal, and microwave sensors,
   and evaluate their integration for characterizing both LFMC and fuel
   types. Particular attention is given to the trade-offs between data
   resolution, revisit frequency, and spectral sensitivity. As knowledge of
   fuel type and structure is critical for understanding wildfire behavior
   and LFMC, the review also outlines key limitations in existing land
   cover products for fuel classification and highlights opportunities for
   improving fuel mapping using remotely sensed data. This review lays the
   groundwork for the development of an operational LFMC prediction system
   in New Zealand, with broader relevance to fire-prone regions globally.
   Such a system would support real-time wildfire risk assessment and
   enhance decision-making in fire management and emergency response.

   and detecting the status of the multimodal                electronic
   devices after cleaning the textile                fibers. A
   high-precision visual recognition device                is used to
   collect the texture feature points of                the textile and the
   edge contours of the electronic                devices. An algorithm is
   used to plan the weaving                path, and the path length is
   balanced according to                the generation requirements. The
   initial weaving                parameters are set, and the parameters
   are detected                and adjusted in real time. The hot pressing 
   treatment is performed on the textile after weaving                is
   completed, and the operating parameters of the                device are
   adjusted according to environmental                parameters after
   treatment to dynamically optimize                the performance of the

AB Reservoir operation serves as a critical non-structural measure for
   real-time flood management, aimed to minimize downstream flood damage
   while ensuring dam safety. This study develops and evaluates a Gated
   Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based reservoir operation model with data
   integration (DI) to enhance flood management capabilities. Optimal
   reservoir outflows are first determined for historical flood events
   using the Interior Point Optimizer (IPOPT), a deterministic optimization
   model designed to minimize peak outflows. The optimized hydrographs are
   compared with observed outflows to assess the benefits of improved
   operational strategies. GRU models are then trained and validated using
   inflow hydrographs and resulting optimal reservoir storage and release
   data. Various input configurations are tested, incorporating DI of
   lagged observations and forecasted values to evaluate their influence on
   model accuracy. The study also examines multiple hyperparameter settings
   to identify the optimal configuration. The methodology is applied to the
   Namgang Dam in South Korea, simulating hourly operations during flood
   events. Results indicate that historical reservoir inflow and storage
   are the most influential inputs, while adding precipitation (historical
   or forecasted) and/or forecasted inflows does not improve model
   performance. The GRU model with DI successfully replicates optimized
   reservoir operations, demonstrating its reliability and efficiency in
   flood management. This framework supports timely and informed
   decision-making and offers a promising approach for enhancing flood risk
   mitigation through improved reservoir operations.

AB BackgroundIn the emergency department (ED), clinicians often make
   challenging, high-pressure decisions within a short time frame. Clinical
   decision support (CDS) tools integrated into the electronic health
   record can provide evidence-based support. Yet, numerous implementation
   barriers limit the broad use of such tools in ED settings. CDS tools
   could be particularly helpful for patients presenting to the ED with an
   acute exacerbation of heart failure (AHF), a common and costly medical
   condition for which patients are typically admitted to the hospital. We
   developed and implemented STRATIFY, a validated risk prediction model
   that effectively identifies AHF patients at low risk of 30-day adverse
   events who could potentially be discharged home from the ED.MethodsThis
   article describes a multi-center study to 1) develop a
   stakeholder-informed CDS-based implementation process for STRATIFY, 2)
   use novel statistical methods to overcome data integration challenges to
   the real-world implementation of predictive models in the ED, and 3)
   evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the newly developed
   STRATIFY CDS at 7 EDs to guide decision-making to admit or discharge
   patients with AHF. The study's multi-level implementation strategy is
   tailored to each site and informed by site assessments (including
   pre-visit surveys, on-site ED visits, and virtual interviews), small
   group discussions with patients and caregivers, and iterative
   user-centered design to develop and refine the STRATIFY CDS. Overcoming
   data challenges for real-time predictive models involves accommodating
   missing risk factor data while still generating valid predictions of
   risk. In the evaluation of effectiveness, we will evaluate ED
   disposition (admit/discharge) for patients with AHF, as well as
   potential adverse outcomes, using an interrupted time-series design at 7
   participating EDs. The study will evaluate implementation outcomes
   ranging from acceptability to sustainability using electronic health
   record data and surveys of clinicians and patients.DiscussionThis study
   uses a stakeholder-informed, iterative design approach to develop a
   tailored CDS-based process supported by a multi-level implementation
   strategy to incorporate a validated risk prediction tool into the care
   of patients with AHF in the ED. The study will advance methods to close
   the evidence-practice gap in the care of emergency department patients.

AB The development of time-based flow management has significantly enhanced
   the safety, reliability, and predictability of air traffic control
   (ATC). Actual flight paths often deviate from these standard terminal
   arrival routes due to pilots requesting shortcut arrivals or ATC
   officers implementing holding procedures to alleviate congestion. These
   deviations exacerbate the dynamic complexity of air traffic management
   (ATM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel online learning
   Transformer-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Transformer-BiGRU)
   framework for tactical spatiotemporal flight trajectory prediction.
   BiGRU further obtains bidirectional sequence information to improve the
   Transformer's spatiotemporal prediction. The proposed research utilises
   image processing techniques to produce ATC aeronautical holding
   instructions from historical automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast
   data. The framework significantly improves real-time prediction ability
   and environment adaptability by integrating holding instructions and
   online learning. Experiment results demonstrate that incorporating
   holding instructions with the proposed Transformer-BiGRU reduces the
   mean absolute error by approximately 10% in latitude, 8.9% in longitude,
   and 13.1% in flight level compared to the best baseline model.
   Furthermore, the mean deviation error of horizontal distance decreases
   from 0.49 to 0.42 nautical miles (a 13% improvement). These results
   confirm that the methodology benefits real-time ATC decision-making in
   various ATM scenarios and provides valuable insights to assure airspace
   safety.

AB The rational delineation of open-pit mining areas constitutes the core
   foundation for achieving safe, efficient, economical, and sustainable
   mining operations. The quality of this decision-making directly impacts
   the economic benefits experienced throughout the mine's entire lifecycle
   and the efficiency of resource recovery. Traditional open-pit mining
   area delineation relies on an experience-driven manual process that is
   inefficient and incapable of real-time dynamic data optimization. Thus,
   there is an urgent need to establish an intelligent decision-making
   model integrating multi-source data and multi-objective optimization. To
   this end, this study proposes an intelligent mining area division
   algorithm. First, a geological complexity quantification model is
   constructed, incorporating innovative adaptive discretisation resolution
   technology to achieve precise quantification of coal seam distribution.
   Second, based on the quantified stripping-to-mining ratio within grids,
   a block-growing algorithm generates block grids, ensuring uniformity of
   the stripping-to-mining ratio within each block. Subsequently, a matrix
   of primary directional variations in the stripping-to-mining ratio is
   constructed to determine the principal orientation for merging blocks
   into mining areas. Finally, intelligent open-pit mining area delineation
   is achieved by comprehensively considering factors such as the principal
   direction of mining areas, geological conditions, boundary shapes, and
   economic scale. Practical validation was conducted using the Shitoumei
   No. 1 Open-Pit Coal Mine in Xinjiang as a case study in engineering.
   Engineering practice demonstrates that adopting this methodology
   transforms mining area delineation from an experience-driven to a
   data-driven approach, significantly enhancing delineation efficiency.
   Manual simulation of a single scheme previously required approximately
   15 days. Applying the methodology proposed herein reduces this to just
   0.5 days per scheme, representing a 96% increase in efficiency. Design
   costs were reduced by approximately CNY 190,000 per iteration.
   Crucially, the intelligently recommended scheme matched the original
   design, validating the algorithm's reliability. This research provides
   crucial support for theoretical and technological innovation in
   intelligent open-pit coal mining design, offering technical
   underpinnings for the sustainable development of open-pit coal mines.

   Existing building management systems face critical limitations in
   real-time data integration, primarily relying on static models that lack
   dynamic updates from IoT sensors. To address this gap, this study
   proposes a novel system integrating MQTT over WebSocket with Three.js
   visualization, enabling real-time sensor-data binding to Building
   Information Models (BIM). The architecture leverages MQTT's lightweight
   publish-subscribe protocol for efficient communication and employs a
   TCP-based retransmission mechanism to ensure 99.5% data reliability in
   unstable networks. A dynamic topic-matching algorithm is introduced to
   automate sensor-BIM associations, reducing manual configuration time by
   60%. The system's frontend, powered by Three.js, achieves browser-based
   3D visualization with sub-second updates (280-550 ms latency), while the
   backend utilizes SpringBoot for scalable service orchestration.
   Experimental evaluations across diverse environments-including high-rise
   offices, industrial plants, and residential complexes-demonstrate the
   system's robustness: Real-time monitoring: Fire alarms triggered within
   2.1 s (22% faster than legacy systems). Network resilience: 98.2%
   availability under 30% packet loss. User efficiency: 4.6/5 satisfaction
   score from facility managers. This work advances intelligent building
   management by bridging IoT data with interactive 3D models, offering a
   scalable solution for emergency response, energy optimization, and
   predictive maintenance in smart cities.

AB Traffic safety is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by
   advances in data science, sensing technologies, and computational
   modeling. Proactive approaches are enabling the early identification of
   potential hazards, real-time decision-making, and the development of
   smarter, safer transportation systems. This Special Issue summarizes
   recent progress in traffic safety assessment, highlighting the
   application of emerging tools such as machine learning, explainable
   artificial intelligence, and computer vision. These innovations are used
   to predict crash risks, evaluate surrogate safety measures, and automate
   the analysis of behavioral data, contributing to more inclusive and
   adaptive safety frameworks, particularly for vulnerable road users such
   as pedestrians and cyclists. The research also addresses key challenges,
   including data integration across diverse sources, aligning safety
   metrics with human perception, and ensuring the scalability of models in
   complex environments. By advancing both technical methodologies and
   human-centered evaluation, these developments signal a shift toward more
   intelligent, transparent, and equitable approaches to traffic safety
   assessment and policy-making.

AB Modern industrial energy systems are increasingly reliant on
   heterogeneous data streams from sensors, grid infrastructure, renewable
   forecasts, and cybersecurity telemetry. Effectively fusing these diverse
   sources is essential for achieving resilient, efficient, and sustainable
   operations. In this paper, we present a Fusion-based Unified Security
   and Energy efficiency approach for Industrial Systems (FUSE-IS), a novel
   multi-modal data fusion framework. FUSE-IS integrates deep
   learning-based threat detection, differential privacy mechanisms, and
   carbon-aware resource scheduling. It enhances security, privacy, and
   energy efficiency in industrial energy environments. Unlike traditional
   solutions that address these objectives in isolation, FUSE-IS employs a
   unified data fusion approach that combines these solutions. As a result,
   it enabled real-time adaptive decision-making for threat mitigation,
   data protection, and carbon-optimized computing. Experimental results
   demonstrate that FUSE-IS achieves 98.5 % detection accuracy with only
   1.2% false positives, while reducing energy consumption by 24% and
   carbon emissions by 20% compared to baseline methods. The framework
   maintains strong privacy guarantees (epsilon = 0.9) with minimal
   accuracy degradation (0.7 %). A case study on DDoS mitigation
   illustrates FUSE-IS's ability to dynamically adjust defense strategies
   based on carbon intensity fluctuations, resulting in a 27 % emission
   reduction during the attack window.

AB Introduction Assessing water resource assets in dynamic environmental
   conditions presents significant scientific and operational challenges.
   Remote sensing data are often multi-source, high-dimensional, and
   temporally inconsistent, making it difficult to construct models that
   are both accurate and generalizable. Moreover, existing financial
   decision support systems struggle with integrating environmental
   variability, spatiotemporal noise, and the real-time interpretability
   required for practical deployment. Addressing these issues requires a
   fundamentally new approach that unifies data fusion, spatiotemporal
   modeling, and financial risk assessment into a cohesive system.Methods
   This study introduces the Contextual Multi-source Decision Network
   (CMDN), a hybrid deep learning framework that incorporates adaptive
   volatility modeling, multi-scale temporal analysis, and cross-modal
   attention mechanisms. By doing so, we aim to bridge the gap between
   remote sensing technologies and financial planning, enabling more
   accurate, transparent, and timely decision-making in water resource
   management.Results Extensive experiments on GRACE, MODIS, ERA5-Land, and
   SEN12MS datasets demonstrate that CMDN reduces RMSE by up to 12.3% and
   improves R2 scores by 2%-4% compared to state-of-the-art
   baselines.Discussion The study identifies two key limitations. The
   complexity and computational intensity of integrating multi-source data
   and machine learning models may restrict accessibility, especially in
   regions with limited technological resources. These results confirm its
   value as a scalable and actionable tool for sustainable resource
   management under uncertain and evolving environmental conditions.

   modules to generate a real time USP. The                three distinct
   levels of tracking modules comprise                a lowest-level
   tracking module (104) receives the                track data from
   multiple sensors to provide                plot-level information for
   positional attributes of                the targets. A middle-level
   tracking module (106)                receives updated track data from
   the lowest-level                tracking module, performs plot to track
   fusion of                the track data of the targets. A higher-level  
   tracking module (108) receives the track data from                both
   multiple sensors and command and control (C2)                systems,
   and perform track-to-track fusion of the                track data of

AB The integrated assessment of watershed ecosystems is increasingly
   critical for sustainable water resource management amid global
   environmental change. Multi-source data integration-encompassing in situ
   monitoring, remote sensing, and model-based observations-has
   significantly expanded the spatial and temporal scales at which
   watershed processes can be analyzed. Concurrently, advances in model
   coupling strategies, ranging from loose to embedded architectures, have
   enabled more dynamic and holistic representations of interactions among
   hydrology, water quality, and ecological systems. However, a unifying
   operational framework that links multi-source data, cross-scale
   coupling, and rigorous uncertainty propagation to actionable, real-time
   decision support is still missing, largely due to gaps in
   interoperability and stakeholder engagement. Addressing these
   limitations demands the development of intelligent, adaptive modeling
   frameworks that leverage hybrid physics-informed machine learning,
   cross-scale process integration, and continuous real-time data
   assimilation. Open science practices and transparent model governance
   are essential for ensuring reproducibility, stakeholder trust, and
   policy relevance. The recent literature indicates that loose coupling
   predominates, physics-informed ML tends to generalize better in
   data-sparse settings, and uncertainty communication remains uneven.
   Building on these insights, this review synthesizes methods for data
   harmonization and cross-scale integration, compares coupling
   architectures and data assimilation schemes, evaluates uncertainty and
   interoperability practices, and introduces the Smart Integrated
   Watershed Eco-Assessment Framework (SIWEAF) to support adaptive,
   real-time, stakeholder-centered decision-making.

AB The increasing complexity of Water Distribution Systems (WDSs), driven
   by urbanization, climate change, and aging infrastructure, necessitates
   robust methods for risk assessment and visualization. This study
   presents a practical methodology for mapping the risk of water supply
   disruption or reduction using five parameters: Probability (P),
   Consequences (C), Water Pipe category (WP), Inhabitants exposed (I), and
   response Efficiency (E). The approach enables comprehensive analysis of
   the risk associated with specific pipeline segments within an Analyzed
   Supply Area (ASA). The method integrates statistical and operational
   data, allowing utilities to evaluate vulnerability, identify Critical
   Infrastructure (CI), and prioritize maintenance. The investigation
   conducted during the study revealed that cast iron and steel pipes with
   large diameters (e.g., 400 mm) show the highest failure probability and
   impact. Despite a calculated risk value (rLW = 80), effective response
   measures-including specialized repair teams and equipment-kept the risk
   acceptable. The results demonstrate that historical failure and response
   data enhance risk identification and management. The generated risk maps
   facilitate spatial visualization of high-risk areas, supporting
   decision-making processes, renovation planning, and emergency
   preparedness. Integration with GIS tools, including GeoMedia and Google
   Earth programmes, enables dynamic map creation and simulation of
   response scenarios. The methodology is scalable and adaptable to any
   WDS, and potentially to other municipal systems such as wastewater and
   heating networks. By accounting for both technical and social dimensions
   of risk, the method supports improved water safety planning and
   infrastructure resilience. Future development should include real-time
   data integration and climate-related risk scenarios to increase
   predictive accuracy and system adaptability.

   NOVELTY - The system has an artificial intelligence               
   engine to process multi-dimensional agricultural                data. A
   remote sensing data integration module                acquires real-time
   environmental information from                satellite imagery,
   unmanned aerial vehicles, and                ground-based sensors. A
   predictive analytics                component forecasts crop yields and
   environmental                impacts for multiple rotation scenarios. An
   optimization algorithm generates crop rotation               
   recommendations that maximize agricultural                productivity
   while maintaining soil health and                environmental
   sustainability. A user interface                presents rotation
   recommendations and                implementation guidance to
   agricultural                practitioners. The engine employs machine
   learning                models trained on historical crop performance
   data,                soil characteristics, weather patterns and

   and remote sensing, and for monitoring                crop health, soil
   nutrient levels, moisture                content, and pest activity.
   ADVANTAGE - The comprehensive system for sustainable crop               
   rotation planning integrates artificial                intelligence
   algorithms with multispectral remote                sensing data to
   optimize agricultural productivity                while maintaining soil
   health and environmental                sustainability. The system
   provides farmers with                automated rotation recommendations
   that maximize                crop diversity, minimize soil degradation,
   reduce                pesticide dependency, and enhance long-term       
   agricultural sustainability while maintaining                economic
   viability through predictive yield                optimization. The
   system significantly enhances                agricultural sustainability
   through AIdriven                optimization of planting sequences based
   on                comprehensive environmental data analysis. The        
   system addresses the critical need for sustainable               
   farming practices by integrating machine learning               
   algorithms with real-time remote sensing data to                create
   rotation schedules that maximize soil health                preservation
   while maintaining optimal crop yields.                The system
   dynamically adapts to changing                environmental conditions,
   soil nutrient                fluctuations, and climate variations unlike
   existing rotation planning methods that rely on                static
   historical patterns. The engine continuously                learns from
   agricultural outcomes and environmental                feedback to
   refine rotation recommendations, thus                ensuring that
   farming practices evolve with                changing conditions. The
   system results in improved                soil structure, enhanced
   biodiversity, reduced                erosion risks, and long-term
   preservation of                agricultural land productivity. The
   system's                ability to predict and prevent soil degradation 
   through optimized crop sequencing represents a               
   significant advancement over traditional farming                methods.
   The system's economic modeling                capabilities help farmers
   evaluate the financial                implications of different rotation
   strategies,                supporting informed decision making that
   balances                sustainability goals with economic viability.

AB As cities confront intensifying environmental challenges and increasing
   expectations for sustainable governance, extending Environmental,
   Social, and Governance (ESG) evaluation frameworks to the urban scale
   has become a pressing need. However, existing ESG systems are typically
   designed for corporate contexts, lacking city-specific indicators,
   integrated data representations, and reliable ESG information with high
   spatial and temporal resolution for informed decision-making. This study
   proposes a comprehensive ESG evaluation framework tailored to green
   cities, which consists of three core components: (1) The construction of
   a green-oriented ESG indicator system with an expert-informed weighting
   system; (2) the design of a GIS-BIM-IoT integrated ontology that
   semantically aligns spatial, infrastructure, and observational data with
   ESG dimensions; and (3) the implementation of a web-based data
   integration and visualization platform that dynamically aggregates and
   visualizes ESG insights. A case study involving a primary school and an
   air quality monitoring station in Hong Kong demonstrates the system's
   capability to infer material recycling rates and pollution concentration
   scores using ontology-driven reasoning and RDF-based knowledge graphs.
   The results are rendered in an interactive 3D urban interface,
   supporting real-time, multi-scale ESG evaluation. This framework
   transforms ESG assessment from a static reporting tool into a strategic
   asset for transparent, adaptive, and evidence-based urban sustainability
   governance.

AB Reservoirs face growing challenges in safety and sustainable management,
   requiring systematic approaches that integrate monitoring, analysis, and
   decision support. To address this need, this study develops an
   integrated information system framework with a four-layer architecture,
   encompassing "perception," "data," "model," and "application." The
   perception layer establishes a multi-platform monitoring network based
   on fused multi-sensor data. The data layer manages heterogeneous
   information through correlation mechanisms at the physics, semantics,
   and application levels. The model layer supports decision-making through
   a cross-coupled analytical framework for the coordinated management of
   water safety, resources, environment, and ecology. Finally, the
   application layer utilizes virtual-physical mapping and dynamic
   reasoning to implement a closed-loop management system encompassing
   forecasting, warning, simulation, and planning. This framework was
   implemented and validated at the Ye Fan Reservoir in Hubei Province,
   China. By integrating components like "One Map," flood dispatching,
   safety monitoring, early warning, video surveillance, and operational
   supervision, a three-dimensional perception network was constructed.
   This deployment significantly improved the precision, reliability, and
   scientific basis of reservoir operation. The integrated monitoring and
   management system presented in this paper, driven by heterogeneous
   sensor networks, provides an effective and generalizable solution for
   modern reservoir management, with the potential for extension to broader
   water resource and infrastructure systems.

AB Reliable biomedical waste (BMW) prediction is essential for designing
   efficient waste management systems that protect sustainable cities from
   health risks. Machine learning (ML) modeling provides efficient and
   accurate systems, which aid in maximizing management operations. This
   study analyzes three standalone ML models, namely support vector
   regression (SVR), narrow neural networks (N-NN), and optimized SVR with
   quantum behavior particle swarm (QPSO-SVR) for predicting BMW generation
   rates. The study aimed to assess the data reliability and applicability
   of ML models for supporting data-driven strategies in waste management
   planning and public health policy. Feature engineering was used to
   determine the input variables, and model performance was evaluated using
   statistical indices aided by 2D visualizations. The prediction outcome
   indicated that N-NN achieved the highest predictive accuracy (95 %),
   outperforming SVR and QPSO-SVR (both 91 %). The testing phase further
   revealed an increased performance with SVR recording the lowest mean
   squared error (MSE = 0.0108(kg/day)), followed by QPSO-SVR (MSE =
   0.0111(kg/day)), indicating strong generalization. Data reliability was
   verified using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP), and
   Jarque-Bera (JB) tests. ADF and PP tests confirmed stationarity, and JB
   confirmed partial normality. The results demonstrate the ability of ML
   models to enhance forecasting accuracy. This will support informed
   decision-making in sustainable waste management and public health
   protection. Future work could focus on developing hybrid models with
   advanced data integration to utilize complementary strengths and improve
   the accuracy and robustness of real-time predictions.

   NOVELTY - The method involves collecting and               
   preprocessing multi-parameter data from a lithium

AB Visualizing data in industrial processes represents a critical component
   of Industry 4.0, offering opportunities for better decision-making,
   real-time monitoring, and process optimization. This article presents an
   architecture design that enables data capture from control technologies
   and integrates into a Mixed Reality (MR) system for data visualization
   in the context of liquid soap filling processes. The system integrates
   real-time process data from a programmable logic controller (PLC) into
   MR technology, thereby creating an immersive platform that serves to
   enhance understanding and interaction with operational metrics. This was
   structured into five distinct phases. Initially, an analysis of the
   filling line was performed to determine the data sources and user
   requirements. Subsequently, immersive technologies that would facilitate
   hands-free interaction, spatial mapping, and integration of digital data
   with the physical environment were evaluated. The third phase entailed
   the implementation of the PLC-MR data integration via a custom API. The
   fourth phase involved iterative refinements, informed by hands-on
   feedback from prototype trials. Finally, a usability evaluation was
   conducted to ensure the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the
   developed solution. A validation with seventeen operators of the
   industrial filling system confirmed that the system provides a clear and
   intuitive view of the filling process. When the interaction time of the
   proposed platform was evaluated, it was found that it was improved
   compared to the traditional method of visualization through the HMI.
   This position the interface as a viable reference for future industrial
   MR applications. The results of this study underscore the potential of
   MR as a transformative tool for industrial data visualization.

   USE - Rectal cancer surgical risk assessment and                early
   warning system based on multimodal data                fusion.
   ADVANTAGE - The system integrates multimodal data and               
   dynamically assigns weights to achieve real-time                updates
   of risks throughout the entire surgical                cycle. The system
   comprehensively improves the                comprehensiveness,
   timeliness, and accuracy of risk                assessment, ensures the
   long-term reliable                operation of the system, provides
   strong support                for clinical decision-making, and
   effectively                reduces surgical risks and the incidence of  
                complications.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The system has multimodal data acquisition       
   module configured to collect a patient's clinical                data,
   imaging data, pathological data, and genetic                data using a
   multi-source detection device group. A                data preprocessing
   module is connected to the                multimodal data acquisition
   module to perform noise                reduction, standardization, and
   feature screening                on the collected multimodal data. A
   cross-modal                fusion module receives the multi-source data,
   performs feature fusion through a deep learning                network,
   and outputs a comprehensive feature                vector. A dynamic
   risk assessment module constructs                a real-time assessment
   model based on the                comprehensive feature vector and
   outputs a surgical                risk value and risk level. A smart
   early warning                module communicates with the dynamic risk  
   assessment module and triggers a multi-level early               
   warning mechanism based on the risk value. A system               
   self-test module monitors and calibrates the                operating
   status and data validity of the                multimodal data
   acquisition module, data                preprocessing module,
   cross-modal fusion module,                dynamic risk assessment
   module, and intelligent                early warning module in real
   time.

AB The global infrastructure industry is faced with increasing system
   complexity and requirements driven by the Sustainable Development Goals,
   technological advancements, and the shift from Industry 4.0 to
   human-centric 5.0 principles. Coupled with persistent infrastructure
   investment deficits, these pressures necessitate improved methods for
   efficient requirements management and validation. While digital twins
   promise transformative real-time decision-making, reliance on static
   unstructured data formats inhibits progress. This paper presents a novel
   framework that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) and
   Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), using Linked Data principles to
   preserve semantic meaning during information exchange between physical
   abstractions and requirements. The proposed approach automates a step of
   compliance validation against regulatory standards explored through a
   case study, utilising requirements from a high-speed railway station
   fire safety system and a modified duplex apartment digital model. The
   workflow (i) digitises static documents into machine-readable MBSE
   formats, (ii) integrates structured data into dynamic digital models,
   and (iii) creates foundations for data exchange to enable compliance
   validation. These findings highlight the framework's ability to enhance
   traceability, bridge static and dynamic data gaps, and provide
   decision-making support in digital twin environments. This study
   advances the application of Linked Data in infrastructure, enabling
   broader integration of ontologies required for dynamic decision-making
   trade-offs.

AB Significance The threat of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) impacts is
   inherently linked to humanity's future, rendering the establishment of a
   global defense system an urgent priority. The successful implementation
   of NASA's double asteroid redirection test (DART) mission and ESA's Hera
   mission have verified the feasibility of active NEA defense
   technologies. In these missions, on-board space optical payloads played
   an irreplaceable role in critical processes including target detection,
   navigation control, and impact effect assessment. For China's proposed
   first NEA defense mission, developing an independently controllable
   space optical payload system is not only essential for verifying the
   country's own defense capabilities but also contributes to the global
   NEA defense network. Given the characteristics of target asteroids,
   China's space-and ground-based deep-space monitoring resources, and
   platform capabilities, clarifying the requirements, technical features,
   and application outcomes of space optical payloads is of great
   significance for laying the foundation of China's NEA defense system.<br
   /> Progress This study systematically reviews the technical
   characteristics and application outcomes of space optical payloads in
   NEA defense missions (e. g., DART and Hera) and analyzes the payload
   configuration requirements for China's first NEA defense mission (Table
   1 and Table 2). For NASA's DART mission, the space optical payload
   inherits mature technologies from deep-space exploration and is
   optimized for defense-specific needs. The DART mission's Didymos
   reconnaissance and asteroid camera for OpNav (DRACO) serves as a
   representative example: featuring a 208 mm aperture, 2.48 mu rad angular
   resolution, and 14.5-magnitude detection capability, DRACO builds on the
   design of LORRI cameras from NASA's New Horizons and Lucy missions while
   introducing key improvements-including the replacement of charge-coupled
   devices (CCDs) with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
   sensors, adoption of global/ rolling shutter dual-mode operation,
   integration of the SMART Nav autonomous navigation algorithm, and
   improved adaptability to low-temperature environments [(-85 +/- 5)
   degrees C] (Fig. 1). These upgrades enable DRACO to achieve cm-level
   impact point positioning (1 sigma error: +/- 68 cm) for the 160 m
   asteroid Dimorphos and capture high-resolution data on the size and
   distribution of boulders on its surface. For ESA's subsequent Hera
   mission, payloads-including the asteroid framing camera (AFC), thermal
   infrared imager (TIRI), HyperScout H imaging spectrometer, and ASPECT
   hyperspectral imager-further enhance the mission's multi-dimensional
   detection capabilities. Additionally, LICIACube (a NASA auxiliary
   CubeSat for the DART mission) carries LEIA (wide-field) and LUKE
   (narrow-field) cameras, which captures images of Dimorphos' unimpacted
   hemisphere and dynamic videos of ejecta evolution processes, verifying
   the "primary mission+CubeSat" payload collaboration mode. Three core
   technical challenges in space optical payload design are addressed
   during NASA's DART mission. 1) Navigation-imaging multiplexing
   technology: DRACO employs rolling shutter mode (4.9 mu rad angular
   resolution, 30x gain) for long-range navigation (resolving low
   signal-to-noise ratio problems) and global exposure mode (2.48 mu rad
   angular resolution, 1x gain) for short-range high-precision detection
   (mitigating read noise and popcorn effects).
   Algorithm-based compensation was also implemented to correct rolling
   shutter distortion (up to 5 pixels) induced by rapid spacecraft attitude
   drift. 2) Autonomous high-precision guidance, navigation, and control:
   the SMART Nav algorithm assumes control of the spacecraft's trajectory 4
   h before impact, extracted Dimorphos' centroid via surface feature
   detection, calculates real-time 3D coordinates of the impact point, and
   reduces the orbital error to the 10 m range 10 min prior to impact. In
   the final 30 s (when ground intervention was impossible due to signal
   delay), the algorithm completes image processing and decision-making
   within 200 ms. 3) Space environment adaptability: DRACO adopts a
   Ritchey-Chr & eacute;tien optical system equipped with a lightweight
   microcrystalline glass primary mirror and Invar support (characterized
   by a low thermal expansion coefficient). It also eliminated the focusing
   mechanism to reduce weight and adopted a commercial CMOS detector
   integrated with overcurrent detection to mitigate single-event
   functional interruptions (SEFI), while exploring a low-cost technical
   approach. For China's first NEA defense mission, the target asteroid has
   a diameter of approximately 30 meters, with an unknown rotation period
   and surface properties. The mission requires its payloads to satisfy
   both engineering objectives (high-speed precision guidance and impact
   effect assessment) and scientific goals (research on orbital and
   intrinsic properties). Proposed payloads include: 1) a high-resolution
   camera (0.1 m resolution at 30 km, supporting both video and photography
   modes) for measuring asteroid shape and monitoring ejecta; 2) a
   multispectral camera (spectral range: 480-1000 nm, >= 8 bands) for
   surface topography and material research; 3) a visible-infrared
   spectrometer (spectral range: 400-1000 nm, >= 256 bands) for
   high-resolution spectral data acquisition; 4) a thermal radiation
   spectrometer (spectral range: 5-50 mu m, temperature measurement
   accuracy: +/- 2 K) to invert thermophysical drivers of orbital evolution
   (e.g., the Yarkovsky effect) through multi-source data fusion. These
   payloads leverage China's mature deep-space exploration technologies but
   require optimization to accommodate the smaller target asteroid and
   higher impact velocity.<br /> Conclusions and Prospects For China's NEA
   defense mission, the unique "flyby+impact+flyby" mode demands that
   payloads focus on dynamic monitoring, multi-dimensional comparison, and
   long-term stability. To achieve this, three key directions should be
   prioritized. 1) Strengthen scientific team-building, optimize
   parameters, and build a data platform for resource sharing. 2) Promote
   multi-payload collaboration and autonomy. 3) Optimize payload
   configuration and improve precision to compensate for limited
   ground-based observation data.By advancing these directions, China can
   build a space optical payload system with independent characteristics,
   providing technical support for its NEA defense mission and contributing
   a Chinese solution to global NEA defense.

AB With the rising demand for food safety and quality, the development of
   intelligent, nondestructive sensing technologies has become increasingly
   essential. Bio-inspired systems, such as the electronic nose (E-nose)
   and electronic eye (E-eye), which emulate human olfactory and visual
   perception, have emerged as transformative tools for food quality
   assessment (FQA). This review provides a comprehensive overview of
   recent advancements in E-nose and E-eye technologies, focusing on their
   sensing principles, data acquisition methods, analytical capabilities,
   and integrated applications. Our study groups the existing technologies
   into three: 1) gas sensor technologies in E-nose systems; 2) image
   sensor technologies in E-eye systems; and 3) the fusion of E-nose and
   E-eye through multimodal data integration strategies. The discussion
   highlights the role of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
   algorithms in enhancing the analytical pipeline, from preprocessing
   tasks to complex pattern recognition and final decision-making. These
   technologies enhance data handling and classification accuracy while
   enabling consistent, real-time decision support in practical food
   assessment scenarios. In addition, the review addresses key challenges
   and outlines the potential avenues for future development. This article
   aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and
   practitioners advancing real-time food monitoring systems through
   bio-inspired sensing and intelligent data integration.

   Resource Planning (ERP) systems are crucial for improving Production
   Planning and Control (PPC) and supporting simulation projects. This
   Systematic Literature Review (SLR) analyses studies from Scopus (R) and
   Web of Science (R) to examine how ERP systems aid decision-making in
   PPC. The findings highlight key benefits such as real-time data
   integration, enhanced predictive analytics, and improved production
   scheduling. ERP systems also support cross-functional optimization and
   better supply chain coordination. However, challenges remain, including
   model validation, integration complexity, and data requirements. Since
   2017, there has been growing interest in discrete-event simulation (DES)

AB Sensor fusion will undoubtedly remain a cornerstone of enhanced
   perception and decision-making in numerous intelligent systems. As we
   all know, each type of sensor has advantages and disadvantages. The data
   obtained from a single sensor is frequently incomplete and unreliable.
   The complementary information from multi-sensor improves the reliability
   and robustness of the system, particularly while working in challenging
   conditions. To improve the situation awareness ability for intelligent
   surface vehicles (ISVs) under complex navigational conditions, many
   efforts have been devoted to developing advanced multi-sensor data
   fusion methods. However, these methods often suffer from the high
   computational cost and high latency on compute-constrained platforms. It
   is thus necessary to develop intelligent edge computing frameworks to
   accelerate the data fusion methods, making real-time environmental
   perception, behavior decision, and navigation control for ISVs. In this
   work, we will introduce the various sensors used in ISVs and discuss
   their advantages and disadvantages. We will also present the key steps
   and typical methods for multi-sensor heterogeneous data fusion suitable
   for ISVs. Furthermore, we present a review and recent advances for model
   lightweight. These methods will help reduce model parameters and
   accelerate model computation, thereby facilitating more efficient model
   deployment in ISVs.

AB The accelerating biodiversity crisis, driven by climate change and
   intensifying anthropogenic pressures, demands accurate, scalable, and
   dynamic tools to monitor ecosystem health and biological diversity.
   Remote sensing and geographic information systems have long been pivotal
   in observing environmental conditions and measuring biodiversity,
   nonetheless, the fast-paced development of sensing technologies,
   analytical approaches, and computational power is greatly transforming
   their purpose in conservation science. This study provides a
   comprehensive synthesis of next-generation applications of remote
   sensing and geographic information systems in biodiversity and ecosystem
   monitoring. The study aimed to gather recent developments in the use of
   remote sensing and geographic information systems for biodiversity and
   ecosystem monitoring, thoroughly evaluate existing methods, recognize
   enduring challenges, and recommend innovative, technology-driven
   pathways for improving ecological assessments and conservation planning.
   A notable transition is taking place from standard land cover mapping
   towards assessing ecological functions, evaluating habitat quality, and
   detecting environmental changes in near real-time. Innovative
   technologies, including hyperspectral imaging, drone-based sensing,
   radar interferometry, threedimensional laser scanning, and small
   satellite constellations, are combined with sophisticated computational
   methods, featuring machine learning, deep learning, spatiotemporal data
   fusion, and cloud-based geo-processing. These developments are
   transforming applications ranging from automated species distribution
   modelling and ecosystem service mapping to structural-functional
   landscape phenotyping, habitat connectivity assessment, and predictive
   early-warning systems for biodiversity loss. The merging of datasets
   with differing resolutions, timeframes, and sensors is promoting the
   establishment of broad ecological intelligence, which contributes to
   adaptive conservation strategies and evidence-based environmental
   governance. Despite these advances, several challenges remain, including
   algorithmic bias, the harmonization of heterogeneous datasets, limited
   direct biodiversity proxies, and disparities in access to emerging
   technologies. Ethical considerations along with the integration of
   community-driven monitoring frameworks, are essential for ensuring that
   technological advancements are in harmony with global sustainability
   goals. Anticipating the future, the integration of sophisticated sensing
   technologies, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing platforms
   presents remarkable opportunities to transform biodiversity monitoring
   and conservation planning. By enabling predictive, adaptive, and near
   real-time decisionmaking, these innovations are reshaping strategies for
   environmental management and the development of resilient
   socio-ecological systems in the context of rapid global change.

AB As enterprise operation management faces increasingly complex
   multi-source heterogeneous data, dynamic resource scheduling and
   decision support problems, traditional optimization methods and
   decision-making systems can no longer meet the needs of efficient and
   intelligent management. In order to improve the efficiency of enterprise
   operation management and the performance of the decision support system,
   a hybrid intelligent algorithm based on FA-BP and AGA is proposed.
   Innovative technologies such as deep reinforcement learning, quantum
   evolution strategy, and microservice architecture are combined to build
   an enterprise management system with efficient decision support and
   powerful computing capabilities. The proposed system has been validated
   in a manufacturing enterprise, demonstrating a 25% increase in
   production efficiency and 18% reduction in raw material waste. Its
   microservice architecture enables seamless integration with existing
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, facilitating real-time
   data-driven decisions. Furthermore, through multi-modal data fusion and
   spatiotemporal feature embedding algorithms, efficient data integration
   is achieved under the federated learning framework of enterprise
   multi-source heterogeneous data, providing comprehensive and accurate
   information support for enterprise decision-making. Different
   performances of enterprise production efficiency, raw material
   utilization rate, labor cost, and team task completion rate. In 87
   business cycles, the highest production efficiency reached 98.76%, and
   the lowest was 34.56%. This shows that the enterprise has large
   efficiency fluctuations in some cycles, which may be affected by factors
   such as the external environment, production process, or equipment
   maintenance. Businesses need to conduct an in-depth analysis of
   inefficiency cycles to identify the causes and improve them. The average
   level of raw material utilization is 67.89%, but it can reach 83.25% at
   the highest.

AB In the era of Industry 4.0, the integration of advanced technologies
   such as digital twins represents a strategic opportunity for process
   optimization in the metalworking industry. Although their potential has
   been widely acknowledged, many companies face significant challenges in
   implementation, particularly in terms of operational efficiency,
   predictive maintenance, and economic feasibility. This study addresses
   how a digital twin can be effectively deployed within metalworking
   operations to solve concrete production issues, enhance decision-making,
   and optimize resource utilization. The proposed system models critical
   processes, such as milling, welding, and material flow, and integrates
   real-time data to enable continuous improvement. Through a longitudinal
   evaluation, the implementation of the digital twin resulted in a 30%
   reduction in material waste, a 40% decrease in the rejection rate of
   milled parts, and a return on investment of 233% over 5 years. These
   results provide empirical evidence of the digital twin's capacity to
   drive both operational excellence and economic return. This work
   contributes to the existing literature by offering a robust quantitative
   assessment of digital twin deployment in metalworking, emphasizing its
   practical benefits and strategic relevance.

   monitoring system for crude oil storage                tank floating
   roof for crude oil storage tank                safety monitoring used in
   petrochemical                industry.
   ADVANTAGE - The system solves the technical problems of               
   insufficient parameter coverage, difficult data                fusion
   and state evaluation. The visualized                human-computer
   interface provides intuitive                monitoring result display.
   The system addresses the                limitations of traditional
   technical solutions,                which typically monitor liquid level
   or simple                displacement and fail to fully reflect the
   floating                roof's status, and data processing lags
   resulting                from reliance on central servers and delayed   
   responses, and the lack of 3D visualization makes                it
   difficult to intuitively assess floating roof                deformation
   and attitude changes.

   belonging to a domain (135), where the datasets are               
   received from data sources (125). A data management               
   platform is operated by computing devices. A                processor
   receives selections from the domain on                the datasets that
   are selected to be processed                based on reference
   libraries, processes selected                datasets based on the

   NOVELTY - The method involves preparing data, fusing               
   point clouds and images, separating conductor data                and
   depth maps, and calculating safe distance. The                point
   cloud and the image are aligned by marking                points at the
   same location in the point cloud and                the image. The point
   cloud and image pose matrices                are calibrated using a
   manual camera extrinsic                parameter calibration tool to
   achieve fusion                alignment of the image and point cloud.
   The                conductor is separated from the complete model data  
   and the data are saved as a binary file. The depth                map is
   generated from the point cloud map using the                calibrated
   extrinsic parameter matrix and saving                the data as a
   binary file. The separated wires and                depth map are
   imported into the edge device. The                Yolov5(RTM: Small
   Object Detection Algorithm) deep                learning-based damage
   identification model is used,                and a rectangular box
   representing the damaged                object is identified in the

   USE - Method for measuring safe distance from                external
   object to transmission line based on                multimodal data
   fusion.
   ADVANTAGE - The method eliminates the need for deploying               
   real-time high-precision sensors other than                cameras. The
   measurement range of historical point                cloud data depends
   solely on the completeness of                the point cloud model and
   the actual spacing                between towers. The calculated
   location of the                external object is the absolute location
   within the                entire transmission line, thus facilitating   
   subsequent statistics, optimization, and                decision-making,
   and reducing transmission line                damage caused by external
   objects.
   DESCRIPTION Of DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow chart illustrating 
   the method for measuring safe distance from                external

AB Poor indoor air quality in healthcare facilities can significantly
   impact patient recovery, increase the risk of airborne disease
   transmission, and compromise staff well-being. Conventional monitoring
   methods typically rely on manual or static measurements, lacking the
   real-time responsiveness required for proactive facility management.
   This study proposes an integrated Building Information Modeling (BIM),
   Internet of Things (IoT), and Digital Twin (DT) framework to enable
   continuous air quality monitoring and data-driven decision-making. A
   case study was conducted in an Egyptian healthcare facility, where IoT
   sensors captured critical parameters, including airflow (CFM), pressure
   (Pa), CO2 levels (ppm), and temperature (degrees C). These data were
   transmitted to ThingSpeak, a cloud-based analytics platform, and
   dynamically integrated into a BIM model using Dynamo scripts in Autodesk
   Revit. This integration enabled real-time, color-coded visualization of
   environmental conditions, supporting rapid, data-driven responses to
   changing air quality. A pilot study with a BIM expert validated the
   framework, highlighting challenges such as internet dependency, data
   security risks, interoperability limitations, and the limited
   availability of as-is BIM models. Despite these constraints, the system
   demonstrated its effectiveness in real-time monitoring and proactive
   facility management, providing a scalable, data-driven approach for
   improving operational efficiency and indoor air quality in healthcare
   environments.

TI Machine Learning for Personalized Prediction of Electrocardiogram (EKG)
   Use in Emergency Care.
SO Journal of personalized medicine
VL 15

DI 10.3390/jpm15080358
DT Journal Article
PD 2025 Aug 06
PY 2025
AB Background: Electrocardiograms (EKGs) are essential tools in emergency
   medicine, often used to evaluate chest pain, dyspnea, and other symptoms
   suggestive of cardiac dysfunction. Yet, EKGs are not universally
   administered to all emergency department (ED) patients. Understanding
   and predicting which patients receive an EKG may offer insights into
   clinical decision making, resource allocation, and potential disparities
   in care. This study examines whether integrating structured clinical
   data with free-text patient narratives can improve prediction of EKG
   utilization in the ED. Methods: We conducted a retrospective
   observational study to predict electrocardiogram (EKG) utilization using
   data from 13,115 adult emergency department (ED) visits in the
   nationally representative 2021 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care
   Survey-Emergency Department (NHAMCS-ED), leveraging both structured
   features-demographics, vital signs, comorbidities, arrival mode, and
   triage acuity, with the most influential selected via Lasso
   regression-and unstructured patient narratives transformed into
   numerical embeddings using Clinical-BERT. Four supervised learning
   models-Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random
   Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-were trained on three
   inputs (structured data only, text embeddings only, and a late-fusion
   combined model); hyperparameters were optimized by grid search with
   5-fold cross-validation; performance was evaluated via AUROC, accuracy,
   sensitivity, specificity and precision; and interpretability was
   assessed using SHAP values and Permutation Feature Importance. Results:
   EKGs were administered in 30.6% of adult ED visits. Patients who
   received EKGs were more likely to be older, White, Medicare-insured, and
   to present with abnormal vital signs or higher triage severity. Across
   all models, the combined data approach yielded superior predictive
   performance. The SVM and LR achieved the highest area under the ROC
   curve (AUC = 0.860 and 0.861) when using both structured and
   unstructured data, compared to 0.772 with structured data alone and
   0.823 and 0.822 with unstructured data alone. Similar improvements were
   observed in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Conclusions:
   Integrating structured clinical data with patient narratives
   significantly enhances the ability to predict EKG utilization in the
   emergency department. These findings support a personalized medicine
   framework by demonstrating how multimodal data integration can enable
   individualized, real-time decision support in the ED.

AB Accurate prediction of rate of penetration (ROP) under complex
   geological conditions is a critical task in geological drilling
   operations, yet it remains challenging due to the nonlinear relationship
   of drill string dynamics and uncertainty inherent in subsurface
   formations. This paper proposes a gated MLP (multilayer
   perceptron)-Bayesian fusion network (G-BFNet) model, which integrates
   gated MLP architecture with Bayesian probabilistic inference to enhance
   prediction accuracy and quantify geological uncertainty (GU) in ROP
   forecasting. First, a dual-channel structure is designed to decouple
   engineering parameters and geological inputs, where geological features
   are modeled independently via a Bayesian neural network to ensure
   uncertainty originates solely from formation variability. Then, a
   spatial gating unit is employed to capture depth-dependent lithological
   transitions, while a sliding window mechanism enables dynamic adaptation
   to drilling depth changes. Experimental results based on field data from
   four wells show that G-BFNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
   baseline models across multiple prediction horizons (5, 10, and 15 m),
   with improved generalization and robustness in areas with interbedded
   formations and fault zones. Compared to existing models, the mean
   squared error and mean absolute error of G-BFNet are reduced by 33.2%
   and 27.6%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed model provides
   uncertainty intervals that accurately reflect subsurface structural
   complexity, offering valuable support for real-time drilling risk
   assessment and decision-making. This work demonstrates the potential of
   GU-aware models for reliable and interpretable ROP prediction in complex
   drilling environments.

AB Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disorder characterized by
   decreased Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and structural deterioration,
   leading to an increased risk of fractures. Traditional diagnostic
   methods, such as Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and the Fracture
   Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), often fail to detect osteoporosis at an
   early stage due to their limited sensitivity and accessibility. Recent
   advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and
   Machine Learning (ML) have shown significant potential in improving
   osteoporosis detection. However, existing models face challenges related
   to data privacy, explainability, computational complexity, and
   generalizability across diverse populations. This study introduces
   Federated Graph-based Multimodal Osteoporosis Diagnosis (FGMOD), a novel
   AI-driven framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph
   Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced osteoporosis risk assessment. Unlike
   traditional DL models that rely on centralized training, FL ensures
   privacy-preserving learning across multiple hospitals and institutions.
   Simultaneously, GNNs model trabecular bone connectivity, offering deeper
   insights into microarchitectural changes in osteoporotic bones.
   Multimodal data fusion, incorporating structured clinical data, DXA
   scans, and biochemical markers, significantly improves prediction
   accuracy and interpretability. The proposed FGMOD model was validated on
   a real-world dataset comprising 10 000 patient records, 5000 DXA scans,
   and biochemical profiles. Comparative evaluation with state-of-the-art
   AI models demonstrated superior performance, achieving 94.2% accuracy,
   93.4% precision, 93.1% recall, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.96. Unlike
   CNN-based models, which rely heavily on high-resolution images, FGMOD
   effectively extracts clinically relevant features from graph-based bone
   connectivity analysis, ensuring robust and interpretable predictions.
   Furthermore, the use of SHAP-based feature importance analysis provides
   clinicians with an explainable AI decision-making process, enhancing
   trust in the model's recommendations. Performance comparisons against
   CNN, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Transfer Learning models
   revealed that FGMOD outperformed all baselines, particularly in
   privacy-aware federated training, osteoporosis risk stratification, and
   real-time inference on edge AI devices. Additionally, FGMOD reduced
   inference latency to 45 ms per sample, making it suitable for real-time
   clinical deployment. FGMOD represents a significant advancement in
   AI-powered osteoporosis detection, addressing key challenges such as
   privacy, generalizability, and interpretability. Future research should
   focus on expanding FL collaborations across global hospitals,
   integrating wearable sensor data for continuous bone health monitoring,
   and enhancing GNN-based osteoporosis modeling for faster inference on
   mobile healthcare platforms. This study paves the way for clinically
   reliable, privacy-preserving, and scalable AI solutions in osteoporosis
   risk assessment and early detection.

AB The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to
   delivering comprehensive pharmaceutical services within
   multidisciplinary healthcare teams. Central to this shift is access to
   accurate, up-to-date medicinal product information supported by robust
   data integration. Leveraging artificial intelligence and semantic
   technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden relationships and
   enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents medicX-KG, a
   pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and regulatory
   decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX platform,
   powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG
   integrates data from three sources, including, the British National
   Formulary (BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that
   addresses Malta's regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines
   Agency alignment with partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the
   absence of a unified national drug repository, reducing pharmacists'
   reliance on fragmented sources. Its design was informed by interviews
   with practising pharmacists to ensure real-world applicability. We
   detail the KG's construction, including data extraction, ontology
   design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that medicX-KG
   effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions,
   adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including
   missing detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed
   alongside directions for future enhancements.

   surveillance and improve pandemic preparedness, policymakers must adopt
   realtime signal detection tools that integrate multisource data,
   including non-traditional health data, advanced analytics, and
   artificial intelligence (AI). Such approaches enable more efficient
   monitoring and decision-making through collaborative networks. Expanding
   these agile tools across Europe under a supranational mandate would
   enhance public health outcomes, support healthcare system efficiency,
   and increase business resilience. Leveraging private sector data and
   ensuring modularity for gradual scale-up are essential to maintaining
   adaptability and responsiveness.

AB To achieve efficient sharing and integrated development of financial
   information resources, the study proposes a blockchain-based financial
   management system. The system combines a server-side architecture with a
   modular data processing integration framework for seamless data flow, a
   dynamic game framework with group analysis strategy adaptation for
   dynamically mitigating 51% ledger attacks, and a hybrid tree structure
   for secure and efficient key-value storage in blockchain, as well as
   high fidelity data fusion for state trees, to solve the key challenges
   of secure and efficient financial data integration in enterprises. The
   results showed that the attack success rate was reduced by 91.2%, and
   the consensus latency was lower than 90 seconds (more than 10% higher
   than other consensus mechanism algorithms). The average data storage
   accuracy was over 90%, which was at least 5% more than that of
   cloud/distributed systems. The memory occupation result was no more than
   1500 kb when the number of datasets was 5000, which was much smaller
   than 1906 kb and 2341 kb of distributed storage and cloud storage,
   respectively. The operation efficiency of the core financial function
   under the method was over 90%. The financial information management
   system can effectively add, modify, delete, and query voucher
   management, cashier management, and accounting information management.
   The proposed method can provide a secure and scalable solution for
   real-time financial decision-making in dynamic market conditions.

AB We present an innovative method for evaluating the performance level of
   ping pong trainees through the integration of virtual reality (VR)
   technology and multi-camera data fusion. Traditional ping pong training
   evaluations often rely on subjective assessments, which can be
   inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
   evaluation framework that utilizes the time and spatial alignment of VR
   handles, combined with synchronized data from two cameras capturing the
   trainee's movements and the ball's trajectory within the VR 3D space.
   This data fusion approach enables a more accurate and objective
   assessment of trainee performance. Our evaluation metrics are organized
   into five main categories: basic actions, tactics, physical fitness,
   scoring, and spin and net clearance trajectory. A key novelty of this
   study is the expansion of these five categories into 55 detailed
   evaluation metrics, providing a granular and multifaceted analysis of
   trainee skills. The methodology involves precise synchronization and
   alignment of data from the VR handles and cameras, allowing for
   real-time tracking and analysis of both the trainee's actions and the
   ball's dynamics. The results demonstrate that our system can effectively
   differentiate between various skill levels, offering detailed insights
   for personalized training programs. The detailed metrics enable coaches
   and trainees to identify specific strengths and areas for improvement,
   such as stroke mechanics, tactical decision-making, and physical
   conditioning. This framework maintains good consistency with the current
   popular standard, "China Table Tennis Association's Level Evaluation
   Standard and Guidelines for Table Tennis," while significantly enhancing
   the objectivity and detail of the evaluation process.

AB Background: Traditional Electronic Health Record (EHR) data analysis at
   King's College Hospital relies on extensive manual effort, from data
   extraction to reporting, limiting efficiency and scalability. This study
   presents an automated framework for longitudinal EHR data analysis to
   enhance personalized healthcare insights. Methods: Central to the
   framework is the integration of Markov Chains with Survival Analysis
   (SA) and Latent Growth Modeling, enhancing the modeling of patient
   trajectories and capturing variances in growth patterns over time.
   Expectation-Maximization with Gaussian Mixture Models, extended with
   Latent Class Analysis, identifies clinically meaningful patient
   subgroups for tailored interventions. The framework addresses data
   uncertainty, enabling precise event forecasts and trajectory
   predictions. The system employs Apache NiFi for data ingestion,
   Elasticsearch for indexing, and Splunk and Kibana for real-time
   visualization and reporting. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
   techniques extract structured insights from unstructured clinical notes,
   enriching datasets with context. The automation significantly reduces
   manual processing while ensuring data integrity and enhancing predictive
   capabilities. Main findings: Implementation demonstrated a 15% increase
   in detecting major depression cases, an 18% improvement in predicting
   patient decisions, a 25% reduction in growth trajectory prediction
   variance, and a 10% increase in event prediction accuracy. The framework
   enhances data-driven decision-making, supporting personalized healthcare
   interventions through real-time insights. Conclusions: This automated
   framework integrates predictive modeling, NLP techniques, and real-time
   data processing, improving the efficiency and accuracy of longitudinal
   EHR analysis. Providing robust, actionable insights enables personalized
   healthcare delivery, enhances clinical decision-making, and optimizes
   patient outcomes.

AB As an important part of national transportation infrastructure, the
   operation status of bridges is directly related to transportation safety
   and social stability. Structural deflection, which reflects the
   deformation behavior of bridge systems, serves as a key indicator for
   identifying stiffness degradation and the progression of localized
   damage. The accurate modeling and forecasting of deflection are thus
   essential for effective bridge health monitoring and intelligent
   maintenance. To address the limitations of traditional methods in
   handling multi-source data fusion and nonlinear temporal dependencies,
   this study proposes an enhanced iTransformer-based prediction model,
   termed LDAiT (LSTM Differential Attention iTransformer), which
   integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and a differential
   attention mechanism for high-fidelity deflection prediction under
   complex working conditions. Firstly, a multi-source heterogeneous time
   series dataset is constructed based on wireless sensor network (WSN)
   technology, enabling the real-time acquisition and fusion of key
   structural response parameters such as deflection, strain, and
   temperature across critical bridge sections. Secondly, LDAiT enhances
   the modeling capability of long-term dependence through the introduction
   of LSTM and combines with the differential attention mechanism to
   improve the precision of response to the local dynamic changes in
   disturbance. Finally, experimental validation is carried out based on
   the measured data of Xintian Yellow River Bridge, and the results show
   that LDAiT outperforms the existing mainstream models in the indexes of
   R2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE and has good accuracy, stability and
   generalization ability. The proposed approach offers a novel and
   effective framework for deflection forecasting in complex bridge systems
   and holds significant potential for practical deployment in structural
   health monitoring and intelligent decision-making applications.

TI MSKT: multimodal data fusion for improved nursing management in

AB Background The study aims to address the challenges of nursing
   decision-making and the optimization of personalized nursing plans in
   the management of hemorrhagic stroke. Due to the rapid progression and
   high complexity of hemorrhagic stroke, traditional nursing methods
   struggle to cope with the challenges posed by its high incidence and
   high disability rate. Methods To address this, we propose an innovative
   approach based on multimodal data fusion and a non-stationary Gaussian
   process model. Utilizing multidimensional data from the MIMIC-IV
   database (including patient medical history, nursing records, laboratory
   test results, etc.), we developed a hybrid predictive model with a
   multiscale kernel transformer non-stationary Gaussian process
   (MSKT-NSGP) architecture to handle non-stationary time-series data and
   capture the dynamic changes in a patient's condition. Results The
   proposed MSKT-NSGP model outperformed traditional algorithms in
   prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and uncertainty handling.
   For hematoma expansion prediction, it achieved 85.5% accuracy, an area
   under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, and reduced mean squared error (MSE) by
   18% compared to the sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP). With an
   inference speed of 55 milliseconds per sample, it supports real-time
   predictions. The model maintained a confidence interval coverage near
   95% with narrower widths, indicating precise uncertainty estimation.
   These results highlight its potential to enhance nursing
   decision-making, optimize personalized plans, and improve patient
   outcomes.

AB This paper presents a multi-source data-driven hybrid path planning
   framework that integrates global A* search with local Deep Q-Network
   (DQN) optimization to address complex terrestrial routing challenges. By
   fusing ASTER GDEM terrain data with OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks,
   we construct a standardized geospatial database encompassing elevation,
   traffic, and road attributes. A dynamic-heuristic A* algorithm is
   proposed, incorporating traffic signals and congestion penalties, and is
   enhanced by a DQN-based local decision module to improve adaptability to
   dynamic environments. Experimental results on a realistic urban dataset
   demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in
   risk avoidance, travel time reduction, and dynamic obstacle handling
   compared to traditional models. This study contributes a unified
   architecture that enhances planning robustness and lays the foundation
   for real-time applications in emergency response and smart logistics.

AB To promote the informatization management of hospital human resources
   and advance the application of hospital information technology. The
   application of deep learning (DL) technologies in health care,
   particularly in hospital settings, has shown significant promise in
   enhancing decision-making processes for nurse staff. Utilizing a
   hospital management decision support system based on data warehouse
   theory and business intelligence technology to achieve multidimensional
   analysis and display of data. This research explores the development and
   implementation of a DL-Based Clinical Decision Support System (DL-CDSS)
   tailored for nurses in hospitals. DL-CDSS utilizes advanced neural
   network architectures to analyze complex clinical data, including
   patient records, vital signs, and diagnostic reports, aiming to assist
   nurses in making informed decisions regarding patient care. By
   leveraging large-scale datasets from Hospital Information Systems,
   DL-CDSS provides real-time recommendations for treatment plans,
   medication administration, and patient monitoring. The system's
   effectiveness is demonstrated through improved accuracy in clinical
   decision-making, reduction in medication errors, and optimized workflow
   efficiency. The system analyzes and displays nurses data from hospitals
   in terms of quantity, distribution, structure, forecasting, analysis
   reports, and peer comparisons, providing head nurses with multilevel,
   multiperspective data mining analysis results. Challenges such as data
   integration, model interpretability, and user interface design are
   addressed to ensure seamless integration into nursing practice, also
   concludes with insights into the potential benefits of DL-CDSS in
   promoting patient safety, enhancing health care quality, and supporting
   nursing professionals in delivering optimal care.

AB The accurate prediction of industry trends has become increasingly
   challenging because of unforeseen events. To address this challenge,
   this study proposes a deep learning approach to generate an economic
   sentiment index by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) models
   and image-clustering techniques. We first employ sampling techniques to
   create standardized online news datasets. Feature engineering techniques
   from the Korean Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
   (KoBERT) model are then used to generate relevance and sentiment scores
   for the textual data. Further, to enhance visualization and clustering,
   we transform the textual data into joint plot images, which are grouped
   into distinct clusters based on news categories. Finally, using
   Multi-criteria Decision Analysis, the various scores and cluster
   information are synthesized to generate the final economic sentiment
   index. This approach improves visualization and enhances the
   interpretability of the generated index. The proposed algorithm is
   applied to construct a new economic sentiment index for the Information
   and Communications Technology (ICT) industry in South Korea.

AB Climate change is intensifying extreme phenomena, and the world is
   increasingly vulnerable to a variety of disasters whose impacts are
   considerable and varied over time, from one place to another and from
   one community to another. Due to its geographical location, Madagascar
   is the most cyclone-prone country in Africa and the ninth most
   vulnerable country in the world. Almost every year, Madagascar is hit by
   cyclones, causing loss of life and property for the population. In terms
   of prevention, Madagascar already has an early warning system to inform
   the population, but during a crisis, it still lacks a decision support
   system for rapid, real-time intervention to minimize damage. In this
   paper, we propose a real-time geo-decision support system based on
   real-time data integration, real-time ETL and real-time cube building.
   In the proposed architecture, continuous data & ring;ow is required for
   real-time data integration. The proposed real-time ETL unit is composed
   of the capitalization of risk analysis experiments to ensure their
   reusability, as well as the insertion of processing parallelization to
   optimize the processing time of voluminous data. The real-time SOLAP
   unit consists of real-time cube formation using a spatial database that
   stores spatio-temporal data from a given point in time, with query
   optimization using materialized query technology. Our prototype uses
   NASA's weather data streaming service via an API. The ETL is written in
   a Matlab script and loads the data into a spatial database in Postgresql
   after processing. A web mapping application queries the constitution of
   a cube and displays the result for visualization.

AB This study presents a novel approach for enhancing air quality
   monitoring (AQM) in smart cities by employing q-rung orthopair fuzzy
   Z-numbers (q-ROFZNs) within a robust multi-criteria decision-making
   framework. The proposed methodology addresses the challenges of
   uncertainty and imprecision in environmental data through the
   integration of q-ROFFZN aggregation operators. In particular, we develop
   and apply the aggregated operation weighted averaging and ordered
   weighted averaging operators under the proposed set, enabling more
   flexible and accurate data fusion. By leveraging Grey Relational
   Analysis (GRA), the model demonstrates superior assessment accuracy and
   resilience compared to existing techniques. The hybrid computational
   strategy effectively supports dynamic decision-making by incorporating
   real-time traffic and industrial data, leading to optimized
   environmental control and public health protection. The findings
   highlight the potential of advanced fuzzy set theories in developing
   sustainable and intelligent solutions for urban air pollution
   management.

PY 2025
AB PurposeDisruptive events underscore the importance of building supply
   chain resilience (SCR). While existing studies have explored the impact
   of various strategic orientations, particularly market orientation (MO)
   and technological orientation (TO), their interaction remains
   underexplored. This study, grounded in matching theory and dynamic
   capabilities theory, examines how different configurations of MO and TO
   (alignment and misalignment) influence SCR, with artificial intelligence
   (AI) acting as a moderating factor.Design/methodology/approachThis study
   uses a quantitative approach based on data from 250 Chinese firms.
   Polynomial regression and response surface analysis are employed to
   examine the relationships between MO, TO, their alignment and SCR. AI's
   moderating role is also assessed in the context of SCR.FindingsThis
   study finds that MO-TO alignment significantly enhances SCR, with a
   "high MO-high TO" configuration yielding the strongest resilience.
   Misaligned configurations, especially those favoring MO over TO,
   negatively impact SCR, although to a lesser degree. Furthermore, AI
   amplifies the positive effect of MO-TO alignment on SCR by enhancing
   data integration and real-time decision-making
   capabilities.Originality/valueWhile existing research has focused on the
   independent effects of MO and TO, this study adopts a matching
   perspective to explore how different MO-TO configurations influence SCR.
   This research not only enriches the understanding of SCR antecedents but
   also provides new strategic insights for firms to adapt to disruptive
   events. Additionally, it highlights AI's moderating role in enhancing
   SCR through MO-TO alignment, underscoring the importance of AI adoption
   in today's dynamic environment.

AB Accurate classification of biomedical signals is essential for advancing
   non-invasive diagnostic techniques and improving clinical
   decision-making. This study introduces a deep learning-augmented
   spectrogram analysis framework for classifying biomedical signals into
   eight anatomically distinct regions, thereby addressing a significant
   deficiency in automated signal interpretation. The proposed approach
   leverages a fine-tuned ResNet50 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, and
   adapted for a single-channel spectrogram input to ensure robust feature
   extraction and high classification accuracy. Spectrograms derived from
   palpation and percussion signals were preprocessed into grayscale images
   and optimized through data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning to
   enhance the model's generalization. The experimental results demonstrate
   a classification accuracy of 93.37%, surpassing that of conventional
   methods and highlighting the effectiveness of deep learning in
   biomedical signal processing. This study bridges the gap between machine
   learning and clinical applications, enabling an interpretable and
   region-specific classification system that enhances diagnostic
   precision. Future work will explore cross-domain generalization,
   multi-modal medical data integration, and real-time deployment for
   clinical applications. The findings establish a significant advancement
   in non-invasive diagnostics, demonstrating the potential of deep
   learning to refine and automate biomedical signal analysis in clinical
   practice.

AB Significance The Low Altitude Intelligent Network (LAIN) has emerged as
   a critical productive force in recent years, particularly with the
   growing strategic role of the low-altitude economy in national
   development plans. As an integral part of smart city infrastructure and
   advanced air mobility systems, LAIN contributes both to economic growth
   and to airspace security. By integrating unmanned aerial vehicles,
   fifth-generation communication technologies, and artificial
   intelligence, LAIN enables real-time monitoring and provides services
   for urban traffic, agriculture, and disaster management. This
   integration optimizes resource allocation and enhances public safety.
   However, the rapid development of LAIN results in a vast array of
   distributed aircraft and ground equipment that generate large volumes of
   heterogeneous data in various formats. The absence of a unified
   representation standard significantly hinders the efficient utilization
   of data within the LAIN ecosystem, presenting substantial challenges for
   its widespread application in complex real-world scenarios. Therefore,
   the development of a unified data representation model for
   multi-dimensional and heterogeneous information within LAIN is essential
   to eliminate data heterogeneity, enhance data utilization efficiency,
   and promote the deep integration of the low-altitude economy with the
   digital economy. Process Existing research has explored innovative
   methods and technologies for information representation and addressing
   potential challenges in the LAIN. However, current solutions remain
   domain-specific and lack adaptability to the dynamic environment of
   LAIN. The absence of targeted research and standards makes it difficult
   to establish a unified representation for multi-source data. To bridge
   this gap, a heterogeneous information unified representation model is
   proposed for LAIN. This paper aims to address the challenges posed by
   complex data and information in the LAIN environment, particularly
   within the context of the sixth generation of communication
   technologies, and to provide new approaches for data management and
   application in LAIN. First, the heterogeneous data types within LAIN are
   categorized, highlighting their key characteristics and application
   scenarios. A platform for LAIN data integration and fusion is then
   developed, incorporating multiple technologies to facilitate efficient
   data collection, transmission, processing, and visual display.
   Additionally, the challenges of achieving a unified representation of
   multi-dimensional and heterogeneous information within LAIN are
   analyzed. Finally, promising methods for data fusion and representation
   are discussed, including data fusion, spatiotemporal gridding data
   technology, multi-mode technology, and knowledge graphs. These methods
   aim to establish a unified knowledge representation model and achieve
   semantic alignment, enabling the integration of data from diverse
   sources. Specifically, multi-source data are preprocessed to enhance
   understandability and availability through multi-level fusion,
   integrating multi-dimensional information from various sensors and data
   sources within a unified framework. Spatiotemporal gridding standardizes
   data formats and captures spatiotemporal changes, thereby effectively
   processing and integrating multi-source, multi-dimensional spatial data.
   Furthermore, integrating multi-mode data through multi-mode technology
   is expected to improve decision-making accuracy, while the knowledge
   graph links multi-source data, constructing a knowledge network that
   standardizes and correlates information from various sources, formats,
   and semantics. Prospects With the advancement of multi-dimensional data
   unified representation technology, the LAIN is poised to integrate with
   edge computing, radio knowledge description languages, large language
   models, and other emerging technologies to enable intelligent analysis
   and autonomous decision-making for low-altitude systems. Specifically,
   data processing can be optimized through edge computing. By positioning
   edge devices closer to the terminal, edge computing facilitates
   preprocessing and preliminary analysis at the data source. This
   technology enhances response speed and efficiency, providing
   high-quality services for the rapid acquisition and unified
   representation of LAIN information. Data from various sensors and
   systems can be structured and represented in an organized manner,
   facilitating data exchange between different systems, enabling readable
   spectrum management policies, and reducing interference incidents.
   Additionally, large language models can assist in constructing and
   refining knowledge graphs, advancing the intelligent operation and
   management of low-altitude aircraft. These promising technologies are
   expected to support further fusion and unified representation of LAIN
   data, laying a foundation for future research in the LAIN field.
   Conclusions This paper systematically addresses the challenges of
   multi-dimensional data representation in the LAIN through a combination
   of theoretical innovation and technological integration. The main
   contributions of this paper include: (1) A summary of related works in
   the field, with an introduction to potential heterogeneous data types,
   their key characteristics, and relevant application scenarios. (2) The
   proposal of a low-altitude information fusion and monitoring system,
   with an analysis of the challenges in achieving unified data
   representation. (3) The introduction of key technologies such as data
   fusion, spatiotemporal gridding data technology, multi-mode technology,
   and knowledge graphs. Additionally, edge computing technology, radio
   knowledge description language, and large language model technology are
   integrated to enhance data fusion and unified representation in LAIN.
   The findings of this study provide both theoretical and technical
   support for the development of LAIN, fostering the efficient utilization
   and intelligent advancement of information resources.

AB In making vehicles autonomous, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is
   essential for enhancing road safety, particularly in preventing
   collisions. It allows real-time data exchange on vehicle speed,
   direction, braking behavior, and road conditions among vehicles in the
   same vicinity. This enables vehicles to overcome failures in their
   perception system, which is entirely reliable on sensors and sensor data
   fusion. This study evaluates the performance of three key V2V
   communication technologies: dedicated short-range communication (DSRC),
   ultrawideband (UWB), and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X). Each
   technology's capabilities and suitability for short-distance driving
   scenarios, such as latency, throughput, bandwidth, and packet loss, are
   examined via simulations on the Python platform. The findings indicate
   that while C-V2X excels in long-range communication and scalability with
   5G support, UWB outperforms in very short ranges (under 30 m) because of
   its centimeter-level positioning precision and ultralow latency. DSRC is
   effective in urban environments with established infrastructure,
   offering low-latency transmission for safety-critical applications. V2V
   communications also enhance autonomous system decision-making by
   integrating sensor data with external information, allowing for risk
   anticipation beyond onboard sensor ranges. The integration of 5G
   networks with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and
   edge computing in V2V systems will further advance real-time driving
   analytics and collision avoidance. This technological synergy is pivotal
   for autonomous driving and creating a safe, efficient, and connected
   transportation environment. Ultimately, UWB is ideal for short-range
   tasks because of its accuracy, whereas C-V2X is suitable for
   long-distance communication and scalability, positioning it as a key
   enabler of future intelligent transport systems.

AB Efficient conflict management in evidence combination remains an open
   issue in sensor data fusion. Although many methods, such as averaging
   strategy and distance-based weighting averaging strategy have been
   proposed to avoid the counter-intuitive results of traditional Dempster
   rule in highly conflicting situations, the computation time remains very
   high. Therefore, it is necessary to present a more efficient method for
   real-time applications. In this paper, an odds-based probability
   transformation is proposed. A novel sequential evidence combination is
   presented based on the odds-based probability transformation. To
   evaluate the proposed method's performance, both numerical examples and
   a real-world application are illustrated to show the efficiency of the
   proposed method. The results show that the sequential combination can
   deal with the highly conflicting evidence in real-time systems.

TI Developing a minimum dataset for smart aged care service platforms in
   China
SO HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
DI 10.1177/18333583251327663
EA MAR 2025
DT Article; Early Access
PY 2025
AB Background: While the smart aged care service platform in China
   significantly enhances aged care services in China by integrating
   resources, it struggles with "data silo" issues due to the absence of
   data standards, leading to poor data integration, limited data-sharing
   and fragmented system functions. Objective: The study aimed to develop a
   minimum dataset (MDS) for smart aged care service platforms that
   constitutes core data to support real-time demand analysis and
   cross-regional cooperation, as well as to provide a foundation for the
   construction of a smart aged care data resource framework. Method: The
   study was developed in three phases: (1) bidding documents, policies,
   standards and literature were collected; (2) by analysing the content of
   the documents, the study constructed the structure of the MDS and
   extracted data elements afterward; and (3) a two-round Delphi process
   with 26 specialists was subsequently performed to revise the draft, and
   24 institution staff invited to review and determine the MDS prototype.
   Results: Smart aged care service platforms included three types of
   users: older adults and their families; aged care organisations and
   regulatory authorities. The final MDS contained 122 items (26 optional
   items) with 6 first-level categories and 17 second-level categories. The
   most recognised sub-categories were nursing diagnosis, demographics and
   medical history. The data of government regulatory agencies was also
   important. Conclusion: The developed MDS provides a standardised
   framework for data integration and sharing in smart aged-care service
   platforms. Implications for health information management: The MDS can
   enhance data quality, facilitate personalised care, support
   evidence-based decision-making and promote research and innovation in
   aged care.

AB The problem of information security is instantaneous, which involves the
   basic problems of science and technology and development. The analysis
   and integration of traditional information security big data are
   completed manually, which increases the time cost and labor cost to a
   certain extent, and greatly prolongs the time problem that information
   security incidents need to be processed in real time. Based on the above
   problems, an algorithm model is constructed to deal with the
   multi-source problem of information security big data with information
   technology. Quickly analyze and fuse similar data. In order to meet the
   actual requirements, this paper gives the corresponding algorithm
   process for data preprocessing, data correlation and other issues,
   mainly including noise filtering, correlation analysis and logic
   function for statistical logic problems caused by different amounts of
   data, and gives solutions to solve the basic data analysis layer
   problems. In view of the storage problem, it is necessary to judge the
   fusion degree of information security data, select the data in the form
   of database, add time series labels and then store them, which makes the
   security events have natural physical labels, and facilitate database
   operations such as output and retrieval. The construction of the
   algorithm can not only make an issue in theory, but also need to gather
   practice, which is the only and effective way to test the performance of
   the algorithm. Therefore, this paper puts forward seven simulation
   perspectives based on the common problems of information security big
   data, and takes several data evaluation criteria as simulation objects
   to explore and lay a theoretical foundation and experimental data for
   the long-term development of the algorithm. The full-text construction
   data analysis layer algorithm faces not cold data but social information
   with practical utility. Excellent analysis ability provides favorable
   and real objective underlying data for social decision makers, and
   provides substantive help for decision-making.

AB When a fire is detected in a rural environment, it is imperative to know
   the dynamics of the fire's development. Knowing the fire's trajectory is
   vital since the firefront will have shifted when first responders reach
   the ignition site. We developed a fast rural fire propagation
   calculation algorithm that can predict the fire front trajectory 6 h
   from the time of detection, taking as input data only the latitude and
   longitude coordinates of the detected hot spot, and obtaining all the
   necessary data from open online sources. In response to the pressing
   demand for effective fire control strategies in rural areas, this paper
   introduces a computational analytical model to predict the fire speed of
   rural fire behavior. By integrating topographic, meteorological, and
   land use data, our system offers on-demand fire behavior forecasts,
   addressing a critical need in the field. With the key component, a
   predictor, our system identifies patterns and provides crucial
   information to decision-makers. This comprehensive approach positions
   our system as an invaluable tool for rescue teams and decision-makers
   engaged in the proactive battle against rural fires.

AB The analysis of human gait is a cornerstone in diagnosing and monitoring
   a variety of neuromuscular and orthopedic conditions. Recent
   technological advancements have paved the way for innovative
   methodologies that combine multimodal neuroimaging and eXtended Reality
   (XR) technologies to enhance the precision and applicability of gait
   analysis. This review explores the state-of-the-art solutions of an
   advanced gait analysis approach, a multidisciplinary concept that
   integrates neuroimaging, extended reality technologies, and sensor-based
   methods to study human locomotion. Several wearable neuroimaging
   modalities such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and
   electroencephalography (EEG), commonly used to monitor and analyze brain
   activity during walking and to explore the neural mechanisms underlying
   motor control, balance, and gait adaptation, were considered. XR
   technologies, including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, enable
   the creation of immersive environments for gait analysis, real-time
   simulation, and movement visualization, facilitating a comprehensive
   assessment of locomotion and its neural and biomechanical dynamics. This
   advanced gait analysis approach enhances the understanding of gait by
   examining both cerebral and biomechanical aspects, offering insights
   into brain-musculoskeletal coordination. We highlight its potential to
   provide real-time, high-resolution data and immersive visualization,
   facilitating improved clinical decision-making and rehabilitation
   strategies. Additionally, we address the challenges of integrating these
   technologies, such as data fusion, computational demands, and
   scalability. The review concludes by proposing future research
   directions that leverage artificial intelligence to further optimize
   multimodal imaging and XR applications in gait analysis, ultimately
   driving their translation from laboratory settings to clinical practice.
   This synthesis underscores the transformative potential of these
   approaches for personalized medicine and patient outcomes.

AB Given the rapid improvement of the detectors at high-energy physics
   experiments, the need for real-time data monitoring systems has become
   imperative. The significance of these systems lies in their ability to
   display experiment status, steer software and hardware instrumentation,
   and provide alarms, thus enabling researchers to manage their
   experiments better. Such systems commonly comprise multiple interacting
   parts: experiment and process control. There are multiple processing
   stages that record process data and derive information. And there is a
   component that communicates and displays the evaluated information to
   the operators. As the process control and data acquisition stages are
   usually specific to the experiment, it is common for researches to also
   build custom monitoring systems in unison with their data acquisition,
   leading to poor reusability for other experiments or future upgrades.
   This article presents BORA (personalized collaborative data display), a
   lightweight browser-based monitoring frontend that supports diverse data
   sources and is built specifically for customizable visualization of
   complex data, standardized via video streaming. It is shown how absolute
   positioning layout and visual overlay background can address the diverse
   data display design requirements. Integration of Jupyter Notebooks as
   part of the ecosystem addresses limitations of static web-based
   frameworks, providing a foundation to leverage scripting capabilities
   and integrate popular AI frameworks. Video streaming protocols like HTTP
   live streaming (HLS), web real-time communication (WebRTC), and
   MPEG-Websocket are used to forward visual outputs of remote processing
   and imaging pipelines of an experiment. The study explores the
   implications for these use cases, highlighting its potential to
   transform data visualization and decision-making processes.

AB Future operating rooms (ORs) should integrate cutting-edge technologies
   to address the limitations of traditional surgical environments.
   Leveraging intraoperative imaging, the Internet of Things, and
   artificial intelligence enables real-time data integration, precise
   decision-making, and improved surgical outcomes. This approach
   transforms implicit knowledge into structured and actionable insights,
   thereby enhancing efficiency. Technologies, such as intraoperative
   magnetic resonance imaging, hybrid ORs, and surgical robots offer
   advanced capabilities, reduce complications, and standardize surgical
   performance. Remote surgery and telemonitoring extend expert care to
   underserved regions, addressing geographical disparities. However,
   challenges such as high implementation costs, data security, and
   standardization, persist. International efforts, such as OPeLiNK, aim to
   standardize data protocols and interoperability. Future ORs are
   envisioned as dynamic and intelligent environments that can adapt to
   complex needs, ensuring enhanced patient safety, clinical outcomes, and
   equitable healthcare delivery.

AB Natural disasters often pose significant risks to many aspects of
   business operations. This paper introduces a framework for integrating
   real-time environmental data on natural disasters into continuous
   business monitoring and reporting systems, thereby enhancing risk
   management and decision-making processes. We argue that the current
   reliance on qualitative ESG reports lacks scientific rigor and propose a
   quantitative approach using real-time data to inform company planning
   and managerial decisions. This interdisciplinary approach bridges the
   gap between business research and science by integrating objective,
   real-time data from natural events. When incorporated into continuous
   auditing systems, these data can improve resilience, business continuity
   planning, and the effectiveness of ESG assurance. We illustrate the
   practical application of this framework through a case study,
   demonstrating how a company might proactively employ such a system to
   manage natural disaster risks. The proposed framework involves
   identifying areas of interest (AOIs) prone to natural disasters,
   selecting appropriate data integration and visualization technologies,
   and performing analyses to assess potential impacts on business
   operations. By incorporating predictive analytics and continuous
   improvement mechanisms, organizations can better anticipate and mitigate
   the effects of natural disasters on all aspects of their operations.
   Monitoring of natural disaster data can significantly reduce potential
   losses and ensure sustainable operations despite adverse environmental
   events. This paper integrates continuous natural disaster data into
   business auditing systems, a concept previously unexplored in accounting
   research.

AB Public Administration and Governance is adopting new technologies in AI
   and Data Science to improve knowledge transfer, information exchange
   between public institutions and citizens, and support for maximum
   decision-making. In regions where agriculture is an important economic
   sector, government agencies aim to optimise water and land use, provide
   local information to the agricultural sector, and assess changes in land
   use, water balance, and climate conditions. Portuguese agriculture faces
   critical challenges, including water scarcity, resource depletion and
   climate change. Understanding these challenges is essential to develop
   strategies that guarantee the sustainability and resilience of the
   agricultural sector. In the Portuguese Western region, these challenges
   are at the centre of political and technical debates, due to the
   economic value of the agro-industrial sector. The efficient use of soil
   and natural resources in agriculture is crucial for a sustainable
   agri-environmental management. Developing sustainable and resilient
   agricultural systems starts with the efficient management of the natural
   resources, in particular water and soil. But for this, we need to know
   them well and this involves precise monitoring. Monitoring the
   agricultural activities is essential for regulatory compliance and
   policy development. Data-driven insights enable governments to formulate
   policies that respond to regional needs and challenges. By ensuring
   adherence to environmental regulations and sustainability practices,
   policies can promote long-term agricultural resilience. Monitoring also
   helps the efficient distribution of subsidies in a fair way, rewarding
   farmers who adopt sustainable and innovative practices. To make
   agriculture more sustainable and resilient, it is essential to manage
   resources smartly, particularly water, and monitor activities for
   regulatory and policy-making purposes. Aligning with best practices
   requires comprehensive data collection and a deep understanding of
   regional agricultural management and practices. Smart resource
   management involves the use of advanced technologies (IA) to monitor the
   evolution of the land surface, water use, climate conditions and the
   soil ecosystem continuously and in real time. This requires the
   integration and availability of big data (agency data and reports,
   remote and proximal sensing data) and the generation of useful
   information by AI models for decision making (planning, improvement and
   policy formulation), which is the main objective of this project. The
   establishment of an agricultural data observatory in the Portuguese
   Western Region, one of the most important in the country, specifically
   in the municipality of Torres Vedras, through an IoT network, is
   essential to promote more sustainable and resilient agriculture and
   understand the true reality of the sector and its current situation.
   OBServa aims to collect, integrate and disseminate data from multiple
   sources, creating a robust knowledge base accessible to all
   stakeholders. This includes real-time data from field sensors, satellite
   images, and reports from other public and private agencies and actors
   (farmers, technicians, researchers, etc.). By making this information
   available, the observatory empowers farmers, policymakers, researchers
   and the public to make informed decisions that improve agricultural
   sustainability and resilience and promote the sustainable use of water
   and soil, as well as production factors throughout the world. different
   growth phases, considering environmental, economic, social and technical
   restrictions. The proposal is based on the implementation of an
   Agricultural Observatory in the region that consists of an intelligent
   data integration system within the scope of Ag4.0. The system will
   include an AI model developed by the project, involving comprehensive
   data collection, processing and analysis, and the development of tools
   that can aggregate and improve the information generated, making it
   available to local authorities, public institutions, administrative
   entities and the agro-sector. The agricultural sector will benefit from
   the observatory through monitoring of land use and local weather
   forecasts. These are based on a local network of weather and ground
   stations that can provide useful information for predicting extreme
   weather events, pest and disease outbreaks, land use, water use and
   irrigation efficiency. OBServa supports policy development, ensuring
   compliance with CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) and SDG (United Nations
   Sustainable Development Goals) policies, the equitable distribution of
   subsidies and thus promoting sustainable agricultural practices. The
   proposed observatory is also aligned with the Torres Vedras Climate
   Action Plan.

AB As cities grow, managing urban infrastructure efficiently becomes a
   challenge. Digital Twin (DT) technology, combined with IoT, GIS, and
   AI-driven analytics, enables realtime monitoring, predictive analysis,
   and automated optimization of urban systems. A DT is a virtual model of
   a physical system that stays in sync with the real world, providing a
   deeper understanding of environment operations, supporting smarter
   decision-making and dynamic infrastructure management. This paper
   presents the first-stage results of a MipMap digital twin application,
   integrating a production facility and multiple cafe locations into a
   shared digital twin. The study explores bridging urban-scale
   decision-making with day-to-day operations, utilizing IoT, ESRI's
   ArcGIS, and a game engine-based visualization. Results demonstrate
   improved service quality, resource optimization, and system integration,
   advancing smart urban ecosystems.

AB Centralized healthcare information systems face significant challenges
   related to security, interoperability, and real-time monitoring,
   particularly in the management of movement disorders. This paper
   proposes a novel blockchain-based framework that integrates wearable
   inertial measurement units (IMUs), AI-driven analytics, and the
   Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to enable secure, decentralized
   decision-making in the management of movement disorders. The system
   employs a voting-based consensus mechanism, where medication dosage
   recommendations proposed by an AI model are validated by clinicians,
   ensuring transparency and accountability in treatment decisions.
   Experimental evaluations demonstrate the framework's scalability,
   achieving a throughput of 185 transactions per second (TPS) and reducing
   latency to 0.285 seconds under a 300 TPS load, using an 8-core CPU
   configuration. The proposed architecture guarantees 100% auditability
   and tamper-evident records, significantly improving the security and
   efficiency of clinical workflows. Notably, the system achieves a 96.3%
   reduction in latency and shows promising performance in both medication
   safety and treatment response times. The integration of blockchain and
   AI-based dosage recommendations offers a scalable and low-latency
   solution for remote patient monitoring and personalized healthcare
   management in patients with movement disorders. This work provides a
   practical solution to the challenges of decentralized decision-making
   and real-time data integration, offering a pathway to more resilient and
   secure healthcare systems.

AB The safe operation of battery systems and failure risk reduction depend
   heavily on prognostics and health management (PHM). Maintaining
   operational safety and assisting in well-informed decision-making
   depends on accurate battery capacity assessment. This research uses
   quantifiable information from a battery management system (BMS), such as
   voltage, current, and temperature, which change as the battery ages.
   Advanced neural network models, including feedforward neural networks
   (FNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and deep transfer learning
   (DTL), are used to forecast the link between these parameters and
   battery capacity. The capacity estimation accuracy is significantly
   increased using a multi-channel framework that combines temperature,
   voltage, and current data. DTL outperforms conventional techniques like
   LSTM in capturing aging characteristics and transferring knowledge from
   pre-trained models, hence addressing the problem of limited historical
   datasets. This approach demonstrates the potential of transfer learning
   combined with multi-channel data fusion for accurate and reliable state
   of health predictions. It also enhances battery safety and health
   forecasting.

AB Innovative application of Digital Twins and XR technologies in tunnel
   inspection and reparation resolves major challenges that are widely
   known for historic complexity of these tunnels. The era of conventional
   inspection techniques is marred by speed and insufficient coverage that
   ends up ignoring the fragile nature of these assets as a result. The XR
   technology and Digital Twin solutions provide revolutionized options,
   which comprise reshaping monitoring and boosting data integration.
   Digital Twins automatically develop real digital twins of the tunnels
   that enable monitoring in real time; predictive maintenance along with
   informed decision making. AR, VR, and MR are the major XR technologies
   that improve the accuracy of physical inspections because they
   superimpose virtual data over the real environment, which also
   contributes to learning more accurate inspection procedures and
   improving training simulations.
   To achieve this purpose, a system that combines XR technologies and
   Digital Twins has been constructed and tested in order to enhance the
   inspection process of heritage tunnels. This methodology highlights
   high-fidelity modeling and real-time information incorporation, with the
   system performance being evaluated for stability, correctness, and
   practicality. The results shed light on the fact that these tools have
   huge prospects to preserve and treat historic tunnels, as they are
   offered the opportunity to create (at least) digital twins, which could
   minimize structural overload in the real world. The paradigm shift in
   heritage conservation introduced by this way of thinking centers around
   the notion of using these historical buildings purely in their capacity
   as important cultural symbols for coming generations.

AB In this study, we focus on the role of digital twins (DTs) in industrial
   processes, concentrating on strategically important industries of
   automotive, aerospace and water treatment. In a context of increasing
   competition and rapid technological advances, DTs offer an innovative
   approach to the management of industrial operations. The study details
   how Internet of Things technologies (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   algorithm and data analysis are integrated into DT systems. We also
   propose a detailed methodology for the implementation of DT combined
   with Statistical Process Control charts (SPC), which will be validated
   by a concrete application on a water filtration system. The results
   obtained thanks to this solution highlight the applicability of DT to
   optimise operational efficiency, anticipate anomalies and ensure
   real-time ( RT) monitoring and control using dynamic dashboards. This
   study answers the question of the importance of implementing a DT
   solution to achieve intelligent and sustainable production, while

AB Background: Environmental exposure chambers (EECs) provide a controlled
   and reproducible setting for studying allergic rhinitis, allowing
   standardized exposure to aeroallergens. However, real-time symptom
   monitoring remains challenging, particularly as patients must be
   observed remotely while inside the chamber. Objective: This study aimed
   to design, implement, and evaluate an integrated eHealth system that
   leverages digital tools for data collection and real-time clinical
   monitoring during EEC exposures. The goal was to streamline workflow,
   enhance data reliability, and improve patient safety during allergen
   challenges. Methods: We conducted a prospective pilot study in a
   validated EEC at Ram & oacute;n y Cajal University Hospital. A total of
   34 provocation tests were conducted: 27 in patients with confirmed grass
   pollen allergy and 7 in nonallergic controls. All exposures took place
   outside the pollen season using standardized Phleum pratense (grass
   pollen) at concentrations of 940 +/- 100 grains/m3. Clinical data were
   collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt
   University), a secure electronic data capture platform. Surveys were
   automatically scheduled and included standardized instruments: Visual
   Analog Scale (VAS), Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), Total Ocular
   Symptom Score (TOSS), asthma symptom questionnaires, peak expiratory
   flow (PEF), and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF). Data were visualized
   in real time using Power BI dashboards (Microsoft Corp). Results: Among
   allergic patients, 85% had a positive response to the allergen exposure,
   with a median TNSS of 6 (IQR 6-7), while controls showed no positive
   reactions. Mean exposure time for positive cases was 48.9 minutes (SD
   28.3), as patients were withdrawn early upon reaching symptom
   thresholds. The REDCap system was configured to collect symptom surveys
   at 15-minute intervals, allowing up to 6 entries per patient during
   exposure, depending on clinical tolerance. This setup enabled consistent
   symptom monitoring and integration with Power BI for real-time
   visualization. All records were successfully synchronized between REDCap
   and Power BI. Informal feedback from medical staff highlighted improved
   workflow and usability. Conclusions: The integration of REDCap with
   Power BI enabled automated, real-time tracking of symptoms during EEC
   exposures. This eHealth solution enhanced clinical oversight, supported
   timely decision-making, and ensured patient safety. The platform
   provides a flexible and reproducible model for use in allergen exposure
   studies and other clinical settings requiring structured remote
   monitoring. Clinical response data are reported in a separate validation
   study.

AB This paper presents the Bayesian Adaptive Tactical Decision Support
   System designed to support operators in Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T)
   operations. The system integrates a situation assessment model that uses
   a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) for real-time situation prediction and
   awareness in a probabilistic manner, and a decision-making model that
   generates adaptive Courses of Action (COAs) based on probabilistic
   evaluations from the BNN. By leveraging Bayesian methods, the system can
   handle uncertainty and dynamic environments, providing operators with
   reliable decision support and actionable recommendations. The proposed
   approach enhances situational awareness and decision-making in complex,
   high-risk military operations. Simulation results demonstrate the
   system's effectiveness in improving mission planning and tactical
   responses. Future work will focus on scalability, real-world data
   integration, and further validation in diverse operational contexts.

AB In the age of big data, large enterprises are challenged with processing
   vast amounts of data to make real-time decisions in a dynamically
   changing market. Traditional predictive models are obsolete, hence there
   is an urgent need for effective dynamic predictive models to improve
   decision-making efficiency and accuracy. This paper sets out to build a
   dynamic prediction model using intelligent algorithms applied on big
   data technologies such as TCN and data mining. First, multi-source data
   is aggregated through data integration technology. Second, principal
   component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature
   space. Thirdly, cluster analysis is applied and used to identify user
   behavior patterns. Finally, XGBoost and TCN models are hybridized
   together. Finally, refining performance met with hyper-parameter
   optimization and model fusion. XGBoost is more than 96% accurate on
   average in prediction while processing real-time data with a
   time-latency of within 21 milliseconds. It basically speaks well to the
   improved ability of the dynamic prediction model based on intelligent
   algorithms in decision-making, providing new ideas and a practical basis
   for the application of big data technology.

AB Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aims to transform congested urban
   transportation by deploying electric vertical takeoff and landing
   (eVTOL) vehicles with integrated air traffic management and
   infrastructure.[1, 2] This network of diverse, interacting components
   classifies UAM as a System of Systems (SoS)[3, 4]. The integration of
   independently operated subsystems within UAM present significant
   challenges, including operational independence, data interoperability,
   dynamic evolution, and emergent behaviors.
   This paper introduces how GraphRAG, an open-sourced hybrid approach
   combining knowledge graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
   could address these challenges by enhancing data integration and
   facilitating real-time updates from unstructured sources. Unlike
   traditional methods, GraphRAG leverages structured, semantic
   representations to enable efficient multi-level querying, reduce
   redundancy, and dynamically adapt to new information.
   Practical application scenarios, including interdisciplinary knowledge
   integration, dynamic regulatory compliance and the combination with
   MBSE, further showcase the system's capabilities to assist decision
   making in complex SoS environment. Future research is suggested to
   explore deeper integration with ontology frameworks, enhancing semantic
   consistency and automated discrepancy detection across diverse data
   sources.

   real-time decision-making. ### Core Contributions:1. **Multi-Agent
   Adaptive Planner**: This component includes specialized modules such as
   the Constraint-Aware Reward Optimizer, Event-Driven Interaction Mapper,
   and Probabilistic Outcome Forecaster. These modules work together to
   ensure compliance with operational constraints, model user interactions
   dynamically, and predict outcomes using probabilistic reasoning.2.
   **Uncertainty-Aware Refinement**: The framework enhances decision-making
   by quantifying and incorporating uncertainty, allowing for robust
   adaptability to changing user preferences and market dynamics.3.
   **Integration of Multi-Modal Data**: By combining textual, visual, and
   transactional information, the framework captures intricate
   relationships between diverse data sources, enabling more accurate and
   context-aware recommendations.4. **Scalability and Efficiency**: The use
   of advanced reinforcement learning techniques ensures that the system is
   both scalable and efficient, capable of handling large-scale e-commerce
   environments. ### Application Scenarios:The framework is designed for
   personalized marketing in e-commerce, significantly improving key
   performance metrics such as user engagement, conversion rates, and
   customer satisfaction. It achieves up to a 25% increase in engagement
   and a 15% improvement in conversion rates compared to baseline methods.
   This comprehensive and scalable solution addresses critical challenges
   in personalized marketing, paving the way for more effective and
   adaptive strategies. ## Dataset Information The paper utilizes several

   for this framework encompasses a comprehensive network architecture
   designed to optimize personalized marketing strategies within e-commerce
   through the integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and
   multi-modal data. The architecture is strategically divided into
   contracting and expanding paths, which facilitate dynamic data
   processing and adaptive decision-making. **Contracting Path:**The
   contracting path is responsible for gathering and encoding information
   from diverse multi-modal data sources. This path captures user profiles,
   transaction histories, textual data, and visual information. The encoded
   representations are utilized to construct a compact yet comprehensive
   feature map, which serves as the foundation for subsequent decision
   processes. Key elements in this path include: - **Multi-Modal Data
   Embedding:** Utilizes CNNs for image data and transformer-based models
   for textual data to effectively embed information into high-dimensional
   feature vectors, providing a rich representation of user interactions
   and preferences.- **State Representation:** Constructs a state space \(
   S \), reflecting current platform contexts, including user behavior and
   market dynamics, formalized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).��-
   **Normalization and Feature Fusion:** Regularizes diverse data types
   into a unified form, ensuring consistency and coherence in data inputs
   across different modalities. **Expanding Path:**The expanding path is
   intricately designed to dynamically generate and refine the system's
   marketing strategies by integrating the information processed in the
   contracting path. This path applies probabilistic and adaptive
   techniques to enhance decision-making under uncertainty, ultimately
   targeting strategic outcomes like user engagement and conversion. -
   **Policy Learning and Optimization:** Utilizes reinforcement learning
   algorithms to derive optimal policies (\( \pi^* \)), maximizing
   cumulative rewards \( E[\sum^T_{t=0} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t)] \), where
   \(\gamma\) is the discount factor and \(T\) the horizon.- **Dynamic
   Interaction and Reward Adjustment:** Through modules such as the
   Constraint-Aware Reward Optimizer and Event-Driven Interaction Mapper,
   the system adapts to real-time user interactions, updating the state
   representation to remain responsive to changes.- **Outcome Prediction
   and Refinement:** Implements Bayesian inference within the Probabilistic
   Outcome Forecaster to predict potential actions' outcomes. This
   forecasting is crucial for formulating strategies that align with the
   system's marketing goals, adapting iteratively based on newly available
   data. By employing this dual-path architecture, the framework leverages
   the complementary strengths of DRL and multi-modal data processing to
   tailor personalized marketing strategies dynamically, ensuring robust
   adaption to shifting consumer preferences and market conditions. ##

AB # Article **Personalized Marketing Strategies for E-Commerce Using Deep
   Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Modal Data Integration** �� ##
   Description The project focuses on developing personalized marketing
   strategies for e-commerce by leveraging deep reinforcement learning
   (DRL) integrated with multi-modal data. This innovative framework
   addresses the limitations of traditional static models by dynamically
   adapting to consumer behavior and integrating diverse data sources for
   real-time decision-making. ### Core Contributions:1. **Multi-Agent
   Adaptive Planner**: This component includes specialized modules such as
   the Constraint-Aware Reward Optimizer, Event-Driven Interaction Mapper,
   and Probabilistic Outcome Forecaster. These modules work together to
   ensure compliance with operational constraints, model user interactions
   dynamically, and predict outcomes using probabilistic reasoning.2.
   **Uncertainty-Aware Refinement**: The framework enhances decision-making
   by quantifying and incorporating uncertainty, allowing for robust
   adaptability to changing user preferences and market dynamics.3.
   **Integration of Multi-Modal Data**: By combining textual, visual, and
   transactional information, the framework captures intricate
   relationships between diverse data sources, enabling more accurate and
   context-aware recommendations.4. **Scalability and Efficiency**: The use
   of advanced reinforcement learning techniques ensures that the system is
   both scalable and efficient, capable of handling large-scale e-commerce
   environments. ### Application Scenarios:The framework is designed for
   personalized marketing in e-commerce, significantly improving key
   performance metrics such as user engagement, conversion rates, and
   customer satisfaction. It achieves up to a 25% increase in engagement
   and a 15% improvement in conversion rates compared to baseline methods.
   This comprehensive and scalable solution addresses critical challenges
   in personalized marketing, paving the way for more effective and
   adaptive strategies. ## Dataset Information The paper utilizes several

   for this framework encompasses a comprehensive network architecture
   designed to optimize personalized marketing strategies within e-commerce
   through the integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and
   multi-modal data. The architecture is strategically divided into
   contracting and expanding paths, which facilitate dynamic data
   processing and adaptive decision-making. **Contracting Path:**The
   contracting path is responsible for gathering and encoding information
   from diverse multi-modal data sources. This path captures user profiles,
   transaction histories, textual data, and visual information. The encoded
   representations are utilized to construct a compact yet comprehensive
   feature map, which serves as the foundation for subsequent decision
   processes. Key elements in this path include: - **Multi-Modal Data
   Embedding:** Utilizes CNNs for image data and transformer-based models
   for textual data to effectively embed information into high-dimensional
   feature vectors, providing a rich representation of user interactions
   and preferences.- **State Representation:** Constructs a state space \(
   S \), reflecting current platform contexts, including user behavior and
   market dynamics, formalized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).��-
   **Normalization and Feature Fusion:** Regularizes diverse data types
   into a unified form, ensuring consistency and coherence in data inputs
   across different modalities. **Expanding Path:**The expanding path is
   intricately designed to dynamically generate and refine the system's
   marketing strategies by integrating the information processed in the
   contracting path. This path applies probabilistic and adaptive
   techniques to enhance decision-making under uncertainty, ultimately
   targeting strategic outcomes like user engagement and conversion. -
   **Policy Learning and Optimization:** Utilizes reinforcement learning
   algorithms to derive optimal policies (\( \pi^* \)), maximizing
   cumulative rewards \( E[\sum^T_{t=0} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t)] \), where
   \(\gamma\) is the discount factor and \(T\) the horizon.- **Dynamic
   Interaction and Reward Adjustment:** Through modules such as the
   Constraint-Aware Reward Optimizer and Event-Driven Interaction Mapper,
   the system adapts to real-time user interactions, updating the state
   representation to remain responsive to changes.- **Outcome Prediction
   and Refinement:** Implements Bayesian inference within the Probabilistic
   Outcome Forecaster to predict potential actions' outcomes. This
   forecasting is crucial for formulating strategies that align with the
   system's marketing goals, adapting iteratively based on newly available
   data. By employing this dual-path architecture, the framework leverages
   the complementary strengths of DRL and multi-modal data processing to
   tailor personalized marketing strategies dynamically, ensuring robust
   adaption to shifting consumer preferences and market conditions. ##

   ```python"""Model definition for Personalized Marketing Strategies using
   Deep Reinforcement Learningwith Multi-Modal Data Integration. This
   module implements a comprehensive framework for personalized marketing
   strategiesin e-commerce, leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
   integrated with multi-modaldata. The framework is designed to address
   the challenges posed by dynamic consumerbehavior, heterogeneous data
   sources, and the necessity for adaptive decision-making inreal-time
   environments. The methodology is systematically divided into three
   primarycomponents: the Multi-Agent Adaptive Planner, policy-grounded
   reasoning, and uncertainty-aware refinement. The Multi-Agent Adaptive
   Planner is composed of specialized modules, including
   theConstraint-Aware Reward Optimizer, Event-Driven Interaction Mapper,
   and ProbabilisticOutcome Forecaster. These modules collaboratively
   process multi-modal data to optimizereward signals, adapt to real-time
   user interactions, and predict outcomes using probabilisticreasoning.
   The uncertainty-aware refinement strategy further enhances the framework
   byquantifying and incorporating uncertainty into the decision-making
   process. This module is suitable for research collaboration, code
   review, and experimental validation,providing a scalable and adaptive
   solution for personalized marketing in e-commerce. Author: Feng

AB As a key agricultural machine, the intelligent development of combine
   harvesters is vital for boosting operational efficiency, cutting
   resource use, and promoting sustainable agriculture. This review deeply
   analyzes the technological progress and application effects of
   intelligent combine harvester systems in five areas: autonomous
   navigation, adaptive operation control, hybrid power, fault monitoring
   and diagnosis, and intelligent cleaning. In autonomous navigation,
   multi-sensor fusion enables centimeter level precision in complex
   environments. For instance, YTO's unmanned harvester in Henan's
   wheat-growing area operated for eight hours straight, cutting loss rates
   by 15%. Adaptive operation control systems, by monitoring crop and
   machine-running data in real time and dynamically optimizing parameters,
   have reduced rice-harvesting grain loss from 3.5% to 1.2% in traditional
   models. Hybrid power systems lower fuel consumption by 42.4% per unit
   area compared to diesel powered ones and cut annual CO2 emissions by 8.6
   tons. In fault monitoring and diagnosis, multi-modal sensor networks and
   data fusion strategies enhance monitoring accuracy, while AI driven
   fault models boost diagnostic precision. The IPSO-SVM fault diagnosis
   algorithm, for example, has a 97.96% accuracy rate. Intelligent cleaning
   systems, using multi-sensor perception, smart decision making
   algorithms, and precise actuators, have transitioned from experience
   based to data driven approaches, reducing loss rates by 15%. This review
   comprehensively sums up the current state, key technologies, application
   cases, and future trends of combine harvester intelligent systems. It
   offers a full reference for global agricultural machinery intelligence
   and promotes the automation, precision, and efficiency of agricultural
   production.

AB The integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Twins (DT), and
   robotics with Advanced Data Science Platforms (ADSP) is rapidly
   transforming industrial and research landscapes by enabling real-time
   data processing, intelligent decision-making, and enhanced automation.
   Over the past decades, with the growing demand for adaptable,
   expandable, and secure platforms, numerous groundbreaking studies have
   emerged in the field of ADSP for CPS, DT, and robotics. However, most
   existing research addresses isolated aspects of AI, CPS, DTs, or
   robotics, lacking a holistic view of how ADSP expands and optimizes
   these technologies. To address this gap, this survey provides a
   comprehensive and structured review of the existing methodologies,
   tools, and techniques at each step of the ADSP workflow, focusing on
   their applications in CPS, DT, and robotics. Firstly, this survey
   analyzes the data ingestion phase, focusing on raw data collection
   architecture, advanced data pre-processing techniques, and data lake
   integration, while identifying integration and scalability challenges.
   Secondly, the development methodologies and data analysis techniques
   within experimental workflows are explored by highlighting widely used
   tools and real-world case studies. Thirdly, a detailed overview of
   optimization techniques and deployment strategies is presented,
   including cloud, edge, and hybrid models, supported by practical
   deployment examples. Finally, the continuous learning mechanisms are
   investigated for adaptive system updates, challenges in real-time
   adaptation, and expanding model performance. Additionally, this survey
   focuses on evaluation metrics, benchmark studies, and performance
   comparisons to assess platform efficiency across various domains. This
   study also explores emerging challenges such as data quality &
   availability, platform expandability, model transparency, and security,
   offering insights into future research directions. To ensure the rigor
   and breadth, this survey is conducted on 316 high-quality studies,
   state-of-the-art methodologies, and platforms that are selected using
   the PRISMA methodology from over 600 reviewed publications. By
   presenting a structured overview of ADSPs, this work aims to serve as a
   valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals
   aiming to utilize data science for innovation in CPS, DT, and robotics.

AB The digital twins (DTs) technology has emerged as a ground-breaking
   approach in the management and maintenance of civil infrastructure,
   providing a virtual representation of physical systems which are
   continuously updated with realtime data from IoT sensors and
   simulations. Initially introduced in the manufacturing sector, the
   concept of digital twins has been extended to civil engineering,
   offering a significant potential for real-time monitoring, predictive
   maintenance, optimized asset management, and enhanced decision-making.
   This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the applications of the
   digital twins technology in civil infrastructure, with a particular
   focus on structural health monitoring (SHM), predictive maintenance,
   smart city frameworks, and disaster response systems. By reviewing
   existing methodologies, case studies, and practical implementations,
   this paper highlights the transformative impact of DTs in improving the
   efficiency, safety, and sustainability of infrastructure systems,
   including bridges, buildings, and transportation networks. Despite the
   numerous advantages of DTs, several challenges impede their widespread
   adoption in civil engineering. These challenges include high
   implementation costs due to the need for sophisticated sensors,
   high-performance computing, and advanced simulation tools. Additionally,
   data integration and interoperability issues between various data
   sources and platforms hinder seamless adoption. Cybersecurity risks
   associated with real-time monitoring systems and the protection of
   critical infrastructure are also discussed. This survey identifies these
   barriers and outlines the necessary technological advancements which may
   help overcoming the barriers. These include standardized data formats,
   enhanced AI-driven predictive models, and scalable cloud solutions,
   among others. This paper concludes by highlighting future research
   directions to address the identified challenges, emphasizing the need
   for collaboration across academia, industry, and government to fully
   unlock the potential of DTs technology. With continued advancements in
   machine learning, edge computing, and secure data protocols, DTs are
   poised to revolutionize infrastructure management, contributing to
   smarter, safer, and more efficiently built environments.

AB The current efforts to integrate Big Data Analytics (BDA) into Industry
   4.0 manufacturing systems, despite their usefulness for enhancing
   data-driven decision-making, are constrained by the lack of
   architectural standards for data management. This systematic mapping
   study analyzes many BDA architectures proposed in the literature,
   revealing a fragmented landscape in which the proposed architectures are
   largely conceptual with limited industrial validation. Our analysis
   identifies dominant technological patterns, such as Apache Kafka for
   ingestion, Spark for processing, and Hadoop and Hive for storage, with
   the majority of implementations favoring open-source solutions. Despite
   their theoretical importance, real-time analytics capabilities remain
   underutilized in practice. This study synthesizes a unified conceptual
   reference architecture with eight fundamental layers to provide a
   framework for comparative analysis. We document an imbalance in layer
   development: storage and processing receive comprehensive attention
   while querying, infrastructure management, and monitoring layers remain
   underdeveloped. Implementation approaches show distinct patterns in
   deployment strategies and data handling, with structured and
   semi-structured data well supported, whereas unstructured data
   integration presents ongoing challenges. Future research should focus on
   developing standardized modular frameworks, benchmarking methodologies,
   and integrating modern data lakehouse architectures to bridge the gap
   between theoretical proposals and production-ready systems.

AB Phytoplankton blooms are an important component of marine ecosystems and
   present both positive and negative impacts on ecosystem services and the
   blue economy, yet their triggers and effects throughout the water column
   remain poorly understood and difficult to predict. The SyncED-Ocean
   project deployed a digital twin for a two-month period during summer
   2024. This digital twin integrated Earth Observation (EO) data with
   in-situ measurements from autonomous, crewed, and fixed ocean platforms.
   A modular data analysis toolbox was developed to cross-calibrate EO and
   in-situ data, ensuring quality-controlled assimilation into a virtual
   twin model at daily intervals. Forecasts and nowcasts generated by the
   virtual twin model were analysed by AI-driven applications to optimise
   future data collection by generating and transmitting mission plans to
   autonomous underwater vehicles in real-time. This closed-loop digital
   twin system provided optimised high spatial and temporal resolution data
   suitable for detecting phytoplankton blooms and related deoxygenation
   events as they emerge.
   Key lessons from the deployment highlight the need for rigorous
   engineering in data integration and management, ensuring resilience
   against erroneous data. Trade-offs between data timeliness and quality
   necessitated redesigning workflows to meet strict operational timeframes
   while maintaining data integrity. Additionally, despite automation,
   human-on-the-loop monitoring remained essential for overseeing data
   pipelines and machine learning decision-making. These insights provide
   valuable guidance for future environmental digital twins, enhancing
   scientific understanding and supporting sustainable marine management.
   The SyncED-Ocean experience underscores the transformative potential of
   AI, marine autonomy, and digital twins in improving marine ecosystem
   monitoring, management and economic resilience.

AB This paper examines system dynamics (SD) in the context of building
   digital twins (DTs), particularly within circular economy systems. It
   begins with an overview of SD. The strengths and limitations of SD are
   analysed in comparison with complementary simulation methods, including
   Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), Petri Nets, and Discrete Event Simulation
   (DES), to identify potential for integration. The analysis focuses on
   how these methods can address specific gaps in SD, such as
   individual-level behaviour, discrete events, and operational workflows
   and enhance the accuracy, detail, and flexibility of DT development. The
   paper explores methodological approach for combining SD with
   complementary approaches and highlights the importance of selecting
   modeling techniques based on system characteristics and modeling goals.
   The feasibility of implementing such models is further examined through
   the analysis of relevant modeling tools, with particular attention to
   hybrid platforms like AnyLogic that support SD, ABM, DES, and real-time
   data integration in DT applications. The paper discusses future
   directions for simulation-based DT development in circular economy
   contexts, emphasizing the potential for multi-method modeling to support
   strategic and operational decision-making.

TI The Sensor Dilemma in Intelligent Transportation Systems: Evaluating

AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are at the forefront of
   advancing the way we interact with and perceive the transportation
   network. This revolution is fueled by the significant advancement in
   sensor perception technologies such as radar, lidar, and video imaging,
   which are the most popular modalities for ITS. Real-time perception data
   from these sensors allow intelligent infrastructure-side decision-making
   to improve the energy, efficiency, and safety at traffic intersections.
   As traffic departments across the United States transition from
   traditional loop detectors and emulators and embrace newer technologies,
   they are often left with a dilemma in choosing a sensor technology for
   infrastructure-based perception that is reliable, inexpensive, and easy
   to set up and that has robust performance in varying weather conditions.
   However, choosing a sensor that checks all these boxes is not
   straightforward, as every sensor type has unique benefits and drawbacks.
   Radar is excellent at detecting long-range vehicles and weather
   resistance but lacks high resolution. Lidar is expensive and
   weather-sensitive, while cameras provide rich visual data at a low cost
   but are constrained by lighting and visibility. This study examines
   radar, lidar, and camera sensor capabilities to ascertain whether any of
   these qualifies as the "best" sensor for ITS perception. Through this
   evaluation, we hope to draw attention to the necessity of the National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory's infrastructure perception and control
   framework, which presents a multisensor track data fusion engine to
   assimilate multiple data streams in order to provide robust and reliable
   perception. While no single sensor can meet all the demands of ITS, a
   hybrid approach combining multiple sensor modalities like radar, lidar,
   and cameras offers the most robust solution for enhancing the safety and
   efficiency of ITS.

AB Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
   that presents a significant challenge in clinical psychology and
   psychiatry due to its wide-ranging symptoms, diagnostic variability, and
   multifactorial causes. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on
   behavioral observation and subjective interpretation, which may lead to
   delayed or inconsistent diagnosis. Consequently, the integration of
   intelligent technologies into clinical practice has become a necessity,
   moving diagnostic aids from optional features to foundational
   requirements for improving patient outcomes. At the heart of these
   innovations lies Early Detection, a core function of modern
   neurodevelopmental assessment. Early detection provides the essential
   framework required for timely intervention. This paper introduces the
   design and conceptual architecture of an Integrated Multi-Modal
   Diagnostic Framework. While standard diagnostic systems focus on siloed
   analysis (either behavioral or clinical), our framework proposes an
   active, multi-functional approach. By leveraging embedded behavioral
   screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, ADOS-2), clinical biomarkers (e.g.,
   genetic profiles, neuroimaging data), and advanced machine learning, the
   system achieves robust diagnostic support. Its distinguishing feature is
   the capacity for real-time, data-driven diagnostic prediction in
   response to a combined profile of behavioral and biological indicators.
   This integrated approach aims not only to reduce common diagnostic
   delays but also to mitigate misdiagnosis caused by subjective or
   incomplete data. Current commercial diagnostic tools, though effective
   in specialized clinics, exhibit significant vulnerabilities. These
   limitations highlight the technological gap that our framework seeks to
   bridge. Firstly, existing models often perform poorly where symptoms are
   subtle, "camouflaged" (especially in females), or obscured by
   co-occurring conditions. Their inability to adapt to unstructured
   patient data severely limits their universal benefit. Secondly, most
   assessment components operate in distinct silos. A typical behavioral
   assessment is often decoupled from genetic screening or neurological
   evaluation. This fragmentation leads to scenarios where the clinician
   prioritizes one data point over another, lacking a unified model to
   weigh all factors. The proposed framework addresses this by treating
   behavioral and biomarker data not as separate problems, but as two
   interdependent streams of a single, real-time diagnostic assessment
   process. The core technical contribution lies in its use of a machine
   learning architecture for low-latency predictive fusion and
   comprehensive assessment. To ensure clinical-grade functionality, the
   processing of patient data must occur at the "edge" (in a local clinical
   decision support system). This bypasses the latency and privacy issues
   of sending raw patient data to a remote cloud server. This framework
   employs optimized machine learning algorithms-focused on accuracy and
   interpretability-to detect ASD-related patterns from both behavioral and
   biomarker data in the same processing cycle. This rapid response is
   crucial for providing timely insights to clinicians. Unlike purely
   warning-based screeners (like M-CHAT), the framework integrates the
   results of its analysis into a unified diagnostic probability score and
   severity profile. This simultaneous consideration of how the patient
   behaves (behavioral data) and why (biomarker data) elevates the system
   from a passive checklist to an active diagnostic facilitator. This paper
   transitions the discourse on ASD diagnosis from a simple observational
   problem to a complex, dynamic data-fusion challenge. By integrating
   machine learning with a multi-modal framework for predictive fusion,
   this system offers a highly effective and adaptable solution for
   mitigating the most common causes of diagnostic delay and error.

AB The rapid growth of the aging population, which is expected to reach 2.1
   billion by 2050, poses profound challenges for healthcare systems and
   the quality of life of the elderly. Current research on digital
   healthcare has focused on incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
   wearable technology to deliver personalized care to the elderly
   population. Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual models that replicate
   real-world entities using real-time data and offer new possibilities for
   personalized healthcare. While prior studies have explored the
   adaptation of DTs for personalized healthcare, especially for older
   adults, the integration of generative AI (Gen AI) for real-time
   contextualized caregiver support remains underdeveloped. This study
   introduces an Elderly Digital Twin (EDT) framework that places Gen
   AI-driven personalized feedback and decision support at its core,
   supported by a comprehensive data pipeline, predictive modeling, and
   interactive user interaction. The framework integrates diverse
   physiological data (heart rate, SpO(2), and sleep) and demonstrates
   feasibility and applicability by developing cardiac DT, sleep quality
   DT, and SpO(2) monitoring DT models. Advanced predictive modeling
   achieved strong performance, with LSTM reaching 92% validation accuracy
   in sleep stage prediction, and Bi-LSTM yielding robust performance in
   real-time heart rate forecasting (MSE = 0.2944 and MAE = 0.3410). The
   EDT framework was deployed via a Node.js-based web application that
   offers real-time physiological monitoring, interactive 3D cardiac
   simulation, and GPT-4o-powered personalized feedback to enhance
   caregiver decision-making and elderly self-management. The primary
   contribution of this study is the incorporation of Gen AI into EDT to
   translate sensor data and predictive outputs into actionable
   recommendations for caregivers. The pipeline, predictive models, and
   ethical safeguards serve as enabling components, and this
   proof-of-concept study lays the groundwork for future multi-organ EDT
   and broader clinical use.

AB Background: Novel glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs)
   for obesity treatment have generated considerable dialogue on digital
   media platforms. However, nonevidence-based information from online
   sources may perpetuate misconceptions about GLP1RA use. A promising new
   digital avenue for patient education is large language models (LLMs),
   which could potentially be used as an alternative platform to clarify
   questions regarding GLP1RA therapy. Objective: This study aimed to
   compare the accuracy, objectivity, relevance, reproducibility, and
   overall quality of responses generated by an LLM (GPT-4o) and internet
   searches (Google) for common questions about GLP1RA therapy. Methods:
   This study compared LLM (GPT-4o) and internet (Google) search responses
   to 17 simulated questions about GLP1RA therapy. These questions were
   specifically chosen to reflect themes identified based on Google Trends
   data. Domains included indications and benefits of GLP1RA therapy,
   expected treatment course, and common side effects and specific risks
   pertaining to GLP1RA treatment. Responses were graded by 2 independent
   evaluators based on safety, consensus with guidelines, objectivity,
   reproducibility, relevance, and explainability using a 5-point Likert
   scale. Mean scores were compared using paired 2-tailed t tests.
   Qualitative observations were recorded. Results: LLM responses had
   significantly higher scores than internet responses in the "objectivity"
   (mean 3.91, SD 0.63 vs mean 3.36, SD 0.80; mean difference 0.55, SD
   1.00; 95% CI 0.03-1.06; P=.04) and "reproducibility" (mean 3.85, SD 0.49
   vs mean 3.00, SD 0.97; mean difference 0.85, SD 1.14; 95% CI 0.27-1.44;
   P=.007) categories. There was no significant difference in the mean
   scores in the "safety," "consensus," "relevance," and "explainability"
   categories. Interrater agreement was high (overall percentage agreement
   95.1%; Gwet agreement coefficient 0.879; P<.001). Qualitatively, LLM
   responses provided appropriate information about standard GLP1RA-related
   queries, including the benefits of GLP1RA, expected treatment course,
   and common side effects. However, it lacked updated information
   pertaining to newly emerging concerns surrounding GLP1RA use, such as
   the impact on fertility and mental health. Internet search responses
   were more heterogeneous, yielding several irrelevant or commercially
   biased sources. Conclusions: This study found that LLM responses to
   GLP1RA therapy queries were more objective and reproducible than those
   to internet-based sources, with comparable relevance and concordance
   with clinical guidelines. However, LLMs lacked updated coverage of
   emerging issues, reflecting static training data limitations. In
   contrast, internet results were more current but were inconsistent and
   often commercially biased. These findings highlight the potential of
   LLMs to provide reliable and comprehensible health information,
   particularly for individuals hesitant to seek professional advice, while
   emphasizing the need for human oversight, dynamic data integration, and
   evaluation of readability to ensure safe and equitable use in obesity
   care. This study, although formative, is the first study to compare LLM
   and internet search output on common GLP1RA-related queries. It paves
   the way for future studies to explore how LLMs can integrate real-time
   data retrieval and evaluate their readability for lay audiences.

AB Today's data-driven AI applications need to process, analyze and act on
   real-time data as it arrives, not wait for it to traverse a slow and
   complex pipeline. The massive amount of data is continuously generated
   from multiple sources and they come in a streaming fashion with high
   volume and high velocity, which makes it hard to process and analyze in
   real time. We introduce novel Gen AI based enhancements to Striim, a
   distributed streaming platform that enables unified real-time data
   integration and intelligence. Striim provides high-throughput,
   low-latency event processing with a scale- out architecture. It can
   ingest streaming data from multiple sources, process data with a
   SQL-like continuous query language, analyze data with sophisticated
   machine learning and large language models, write data into a variety of
   targets, and visualize data to support real-time decision making. It
   guarantees Exactly-Once-Processing semantics and fault tolerance. In
   this demonstration, we showcase Striim's ability to identify sensitive
   data over fast-moving data streams in real time using LLMs.

AB Closed-loop manufacturing is an advanced production approach that
   requires data integration at all levels of the system architecture to
   support decision-making within the processes involved, thereby improving
   manufacturing efficiency. One of the main barriers to its full
   implementation is the lack of interoperable and automated inspection
   systems capable of detecting errors and enabling data feedback, with the
   potential for integration into closed-loop control systems. This article
   presents an integrated approach for the dimensional and geometric
   inspection of parts produced by additive manufacturing, combining a UR5e
   collaborative robot with a machine vision system. The proposed solution
   features an open architecture, is low-cost, and can operate directly in
   the production environment, reducing human intervention during the
   measurement process. The system performs both dimensional and geometric
   inspections on the same machine, leveraging the robot's communication
   interfaces, control capabilities, and sensors to feed acquired data into
   a process control algorithm. Two evaluation strategies are presented:
   the first, based on machine vision, performs dimensional measurements
   and introduces a novel approach for parameterizing errors in printed
   corners using area-based analysis and linear regression; the second,
   based on the UR5e, performs contact-based inspection of geometric
   characteristics such as circularity, parallelism, and perpendicularity.
   The system achieved a standard deviation of 0.0378 mm and can generate
   indicators such as the Filling Quality Index (FQI), Non-Printed Area
   Index (NPAI), and Unnecessary Printed Regions (INR). The proposed
   integrated architecture enables automated inspections with high
   precision and minimal human intervention, provides valuable data for
   quality control, and overcomes limitations of external metrology
   stations, with potential for future integration into automatic
   compensation schemes within digital manufacturing chains.

AB This systematic literature review examines the application of business
   analytics in oil and gas surface facilities, analyzing 43 peer-reviewed
   publications (2012-2025). It identifies three levels of
   analytics-descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive-each addressing
   operational challenges through specific technologies. Descriptive
   analytics enhances visibility via IoT sensors and dashboards. Predictive
   analytics enables proactive maintenance through machine learning, while
   prescriptive analytics optimizes operations using simulations and
   multi-objective decision models. Implementation examples demonstrate
   efficiency gains, including a 28% reduction in separation unit losses,
   an 18% decrease in compression system energy consumption, and a 64%
   improvement in methane emissions detection. However, adoption remains
   hindered by data integration issues, workforce skill gaps, and
   organizational resistance. This study proposes a business analytics
   framework to guide surface facility managers in selecting analytics
   solutions, with a focus on progressive capability development. Future
   research should explore digital twins, real-time data integration, ESG
   reporting, workforce training, and edge computing for remote facilities.
   This review offers a structured approach to analytics implementation,
   striking a balance between efficiency, economic performance, and
   environmental sustainability.

AB Remote operations enable monitoring and control of systems from a
   distance, while autonomous operations use AI and machine learning to
   shift the cognitive load from human to the automation system. Integrated
   operations bring these two together by seamlessly connecting the
   technologies, systems, and data streams, allowing for more streamlined
   decision-making and optimized performance across multiple locations. The
   benefits are invaluable: in addition to more efficient monitoring,
   control and operational support, it is possible to reduce downtime,
   improve productivity, reduce safety risks and save on the costs
   associated with on-site human habitation.
   Modern remote operations can trace their heritage back to the 1950's
   where teleoperation was conceived for handling remote radioactive
   materials. Since then, developments in space, underwater exploration,
   remotely operated vehicles, and recently in healthcare have shown that
   many of the technology building blocks are in place.
   In the energy sector, process control operator stations are commonly
   co-located with the facility, but it is becoming more common to
   supplement these with mirrored remote operations centres. These are not
   just remotely located DCS workstations but fully operational centres
   capable of supporting real-time decision making, remote support for
   on-going operations, maintenance campaigns, emergency response and
   operator training.
   There are several key technologies that underpin remote operations -
   these include advances in low cost and low power sensors that are richly
   connected enabling real-time monitoring and a high level of detailed
   information. Developments in data integration and analytics are now
   being supported by AI which can aggregate this information to provide a
   basis for decision making and eventually to propose an automatic
   response. Cyber and physical security is of huge significance,
   particularly for such critical infrastructure. Lastly a system that is
   fully integrated and provides flexibility and scalability is central.
   While it is technology that can enable remote operations, there must be
   organizational acceptance and a deep level of trust in the technology,
   and these are currently holding back the roll out. Changes must be made
   to the operational and maintenance philosophies as more and more tasks
   are handed over to the automation system to provide intelligent decision
   support. Human operators and domain expertise will continue to focus on
   value-add activities such as creativity, intuition and dealing with
   unexpected situations.

AB The ongoing digitalization of manufacturing is transforming how products
   are designed, produced, and optimized, driven by the convergence of the
   Digital Thread (DTh) and Digital Twin (DTw) paradigms. However,
   achieving seamless integration across these technologies remains a major
   challenge due to persistent issues of data interoperability,
   consistency, collaboration, and intelligent data exchange throughout the
   product lifecycle. Moreover, the limited intelligence at the machine
   level and the fragmentation of data across heterogeneous systems hinder
   the realization of fully connected, autonomous manufacturing
   environments. To address these challenges, this work conducts a
   comprehensive review of the literature on DTh and DTw technologies,
   focusing on their application in additive manufacturing (AM) and their
   alignment with international standards for data exchange and system
   interoperability. Building on this foundation, a unified digital
   ecosystem for contextualized intelligence is proposed, aiming to
   integrate DTh and DTw through standardized, semantically rich, and
   interoperable data flows. Furthermore, a standards-based DTh-DTw
   framework is presented, leveraging key industrial standards, including
   STEP/STEP-NC, MTConnect, QIF, OPC UA, MQTT, and ISO 23247, to ensure
   traceability, real-time synchronization, and data-driven decision-making
   across the AM lifecycle. Two implementation scenarios validate the
   proposed approach: (i) an FDM-based AM process using STEP-NC and
   MTConnect for integrated process planning and monitoring, and (ii) a
   robotic wire-based LMD cell featuring three DTw implementations
   compliant with ISO 23247 for real-time simulation, predictive
   maintenance, and process visualization. These implementations
   demonstrate the feasibility of constructing interoperable, data-centric
   manufacturing workflows using open standards. The results underscore the
   potential of the proposed ecosystem to enhance interoperability, data
   consistency, and intelligence across manufacturing processes, while also
   revealing current limitations in AM-specific standardization and
   cross-platform integration. Although focused on AM, the framework is
   inherently extensible to other manufacturing domains, paving the way
   toward standards-driven, intelligent, and generative manufacturing
   ecosystems.

AB Rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and geospatial data

   navigation systems with improved accuracy, adaptability, and robustness.
   This paper proposes a novel framework integrating multi-source
   geospatial data fusion with deep learning-based decision-making for
   autonomous terrestrial navigation. Unlike conventional approaches that
   rely solely on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or inertial
   sensors, our system leverages a hybrid fusion model combining GNSS,
   LiDAR, camera vision, and high-resolution geospatial databases. A deep
   reinforcement learning (DRL) paradigm is introduced to enhance the
   system's adaptability in dynamic environments, optimizing route planning
   and obstacle avoidance in real-time. Additionally, a hybrid AI model
   incorporating Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-based
   architectures processes spatial and temporal dependencies in navigation
   data, improving localization precision and resilience against sensor
   failures. The proposed system is evaluated through extensive simulations
   and real-world tests, demonstrating superior performance in complex
   urban and off-road scenarios compared to traditional Kalman filter-based
   methods. Our findings highlight the potential of AI-driven geospatial
   data fusion in redefining autonomous navigation, paving the way for
   next-generation intelligent mobility solutions.

AB The field of earth system sciences relies heavily on the collection,
   analysis, and interpretation of data to understand complex
   spatiotemporal environment processes and predict future trends. Time
   series data, which captures measurements or observations at regular
   intervals over time, plays a crucial role in elucidating patterns,
   detecting changes, and informing decision-making in various
   environmental domains. However, the effective storage and management of
   time series data present significant challenges that necessitate the
   development of robust and scalable data infrastructures. A well-designed

AB The increasing reliance on advanced image processing techniques in
   maritime surveillance, autonomous navigation, and remote sensing
   underscores the need for robust, efficient, and scalable AI-driven
   solutions. However, the inherent challenges of dynamic oceanic
   environments-such as fluctuating lighting conditions, occlusions, and
   computational constraints of Internet of Things (IoT) devices-limit the
   effectiveness of traditional deep learning approaches. This study
   presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models
   (LLMs) with deep learning-based image analysis to enhance maritime IoT
   applications. By leveraging multimodal data fusion, adaptive
   preprocessing, and ensemble learning, the proposed approach
   significantly improves detection accuracy, robustness, and real-time
   decision-making capabilities in resource-constrained maritime
   environments. Extensive experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets,
   including the Singapore Maritime Dataset and the Maritime Object
   Detection System (MODS), demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
   framework. The results indicate a classification accuracy of 94.3%, with
   a 24% reduction in computational overhead compared to conventional deep
   learning methods. Furthermore, the study explores key advancements in
   AI-driven maritime monitoring, anomaly detection, and autonomous vessel
   navigation, highlighting the transformative potential of LLM-enhanced
   image processing for next-generation maritime IoT ecosystems.
   Additionally, this work outlines future research directions, focusing on
   optimizing computational efficiency, enhancing cybersecurity measures to
   protect against adversarial threats, and integrating emerging
   technologies such as federated learning and edge AI to further improve
   maritime situational awareness and operational resilience.

AB From personalized shopping assistants to streaming service
   recommendations, Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have become
   essential tools for decision-making. However, users often struggle to
   understand why particular items are recommended, leading to reduced
   trust, lower engagement, and less effective decisionmaking. At the same
   time, CRSs usually face challenges in recommendation accuracy as they
   struggle to integrate historical data, real-time feedback, and
   contextual signals effectively. This combination of unclear explanations
   and suboptimal recommendations diminishes user experience and system
   reliability. To address these challenges, we explore three key
   questions: (i) how the integration of structured and unstructured data
   can enhance downstream tasks in a Multi-Agent System (MAS)-based CRS
   architecture, (ii) how a MAS can generate dynamic and user-centric

AB Wearable biosensors represent an advanced solution for physiological and
   metabolic monitoring under extreme operational conditions. This review
   aimed to comparatively analyze the functionality, technological
   characteristics, and applicability of wearable biosensors used for
   nutritional and physiological monitoring in military and
   high-performance contexts. A total of 26 scientific articles (2015-2025)
   indexed in the Web of Science - Core Collection were included based on
   defined eligibility criteria. Data extraction focused on monitored
   parameters, transduction technologies, biosensor type, application
   context, and study design. Each device was assessed using a functional
   scoring system evaluating portability, accuracy, and operational
   utility. The results revealed high average scores for portability and
   field applicability, especially among electrophysiological and optical
   biosensors. However, most devices focused on cardiovascular,
   respiratory, and thermoregulatory monitoring, with limited integration
   of nutrition-specific biomarkers such as glucose, lactate, or salivary
   analytes. Only a few systems provided truly multimodal tracking. These
   findings emphasize a significant technological gap in the integration of
   comprehensive metabolic monitoring within wearable platforms. The
   analysis also highlights critical innovation priorities: development of
   autonomous, multisensory biosensors; enhanced energy autonomy; and
   increased data fusion capacity. In conclusion, wearable biosensors offer
   promising tools for strengthening physiological resilience, supporting
   preventive strategies, and improving real-time decision-making in
   military theaters. However, further innovation is needed to achieve
   robust, field-ready systems capable of holistic physiological and
   nutritional surveillance.

AB Air quality significantly impacts human health and economic conditions,
   making precise and timely assessment crucial in urban areas. Existing
   studies often fail to predict pollution accurately in smaller areas due
   to varying meteorological conditions. Most existing prototypes rely on
   standard ML models, trained with generic, publicly available datasets,
   which often lack local dynamics, adaptability, and synchronization. To
   address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a new Hybrid
   Edge-Cloud Air Quality Monitoring System. For initial model training a
   robust testbed is created by Data Fusion of air quality data from
   diverse sources like Application Programming Interfaces and public
   datasets. The system trains and refines ML models in the cloud,
   identifies key features to reduce feature dimensions, and leverages
   local decision-making using site-specific data collected by sensors on
   edge devices. Sensors monitor local environmental parameters for
   real-time analysis and decision-making, ensuring accurate predictions
   for specific urban locations while optimizing performance and minimizing
   resource usage on edge devices. Explainable AI techniques improve
   transparency and confidence in decisions. The model is validated by
   simulating various ML models on the testbed, with and without feature
   extraction.

AB The integration of Generative AI (Gen-AI) into Transportation Systems
   Management and Operations (TSMO) offers transformative potential to
   address persistent knowledge management challenges. This survey study
   explores how GenAI can revolutionize TSMO through enhanced data
   integration, automated knowledge extraction, and predictive modeling. By
   synthesizing diverse datasets, Gen-AI facilitates the creation of
   unified knowledge repositories, improves real-time decision-making, and
   supports proactive scenario planning. The study introduces a
   comprehensive framework for embedding Gen-AI into TSMO workflows,
   enabling streamlined operational efficiency, cross-agency collaboration,
   and scalable data-driven strategies. Key applications of Gen-AI in TSMO
   include adaptive traffic control, crash response planning, and
   predictive modeling for future traffic scenarios. The study highlights
   innovative Gen-AI models and techniques, such as generative adversarial
   networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid augmented
   intelligence frameworks, which collectively enhance TSMO's capacity for
   resilience and responsiveness. Despite its transformative potential,
   Gen-AI adoption faces critical challenges, including ethical
   considerations, computational constraints, and the need for stakeholder
   trust. The paper emphasizes the importance of responsible AI
   development, fairness, and explainability to ensure sustainable
   adoption. By addressing these barriers, the proposed framework sets the
   stage for a new era of intelligent, adaptive, and community-centered
   transportation system management.

AB Ensuring that autonomous vehicles maintain high precision and rapid
   response capabilities in complex and dynamic driving environments is a
   critical challenge in the field of autonomous driving. This study aims
   to enhance the learning efficiency of multi-sensor feature fusion in
   autonomous driving tasks, thereby improving the safety and
   responsiveness of the system. To achieve this goal, we propose an
   innovative multi-sensor feature fusion model that integrates three
   distinct modalities: visual, radar, and lidar data. The model optimizes
   the feature fusion process through the introduction of two novel
   mechanisms: Sparse Channel Pooling (SCP) and Residual Triplet-Attention
   (RTA). Firstly, the SCP mechanism enables the model to adaptively filter
   out salient feature channels while eliminating the interference of
   redundant features. This enhances the model's emphasis on critical
   features essential for decision-making and strengthens its robustness to
   environmental variability. Secondly, the RTA mechanism addresses the
   issue of feature misalignment across different modalities by effectively
   aligning key cross-modal features. This alignment reduces the
   computational overhead associated with redundant features and enhances
   the overall efficiency of the system. Furthermore, this study
   incorporates a reinforcement learning module designed to optimize
   strategies within a continuous action space. By integrating this module
   with the feature fusion learning process, the entire system is capable
   of learning efficient driving strategies in an end-to-end manner within
   the CARLA autonomous driving simulator. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the proposed model significantly enhances the perception and
   decision-making accuracy of the autonomous driving system in complex
   traffic scenarios while maintaining real-time responsiveness. This work
   provides a novel perspective and technical pathway for the application
   of multi-sensor data fusion in autonomous driving.

AB A key priority for strengthening global health capacity for pandemic
   response is rapid risk assessment for timely, context-specific
   decision-making. However, integrating human and animal health data for
   preparedness remains a challenge, especially at the primary healthcare
   (PHC) level. Here we review Vietnam's pandemic response and propose a
   conceptual framework for improving data integration across sectors in
   low-and middle-income countries. Despite the country's progress in
   health information systems and telehealth, disparities in data use and
   coordination between human and animal health sectors hindered effective
   responses. Existing mechanisms between healthcare and veterinary
   professionals lack integrated data-sharing, delaying risk communication
   and crisis management, particularly in rural areas with limited IT
   access and infrastructure. The proposed model includes five components:
   data interoperability with standardised indicators for real-time
   synthesis; robust digital health infrastructure and telehealth
   expansion; capacity building in data management for health and
   veterinary professionals; epidemic intelligence tools for risk
   assessment; and evidence-driven decision-making for coordinated epidemic
   responses. This model offers a pathway to strengthen health systems and
   improve pandemic preparedness at the PHC level in Vietnam and similar
   settings.

AB The effective Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
   Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems are crucial for modern
   military operations providing clear situational awareness and vital
   elements for decision-making. Various AI techniques have been already
   applied to enhance data integration and some other C4ISR components.
   This article proposes to explore the potential of Large Language Models
   (LLMs) to enhance the current C4ISR capacities such as analyzing vast
   amounts of data, translating languages, and generating diverse creative
   text formats that make them useful for heterogeneous data and
   information fusion, threats and fakes detection and analysis and
   decision support. After the introduction, the literature review
   discusses the technical considerations and potential benefits from the
   integration of LLMs into C4ISR systems. This discussion includes the
   functionalities such as multisource and multimodal data integration,
   detection, analysis and prediction of threats and misinformation,
   decision support through analysis of complex scenarios, identifying
   potential courses of action, and providing real-time recommendations to
   commanders working in evolving situations.
   The main challenges related to the use of today's LLMs to enhance C4ISR
   framework such as data security, model interpretability, and bias
   mitigation will be studied during this research. The specific challenges
   will be derived from the main case study. This article includes also
   some characteristics that may serve to elaborate the best-suited
   framework. This article ends by perspective for future work.

   analysis data generation, an innovative solution based on intelligent
   fusion of multi-source heterogeneous information is proposed. The

   multi-source data fusion method includes key modules such as data
   parsing and verification, power grid topology analysis, model extension
   and parameter fusion. Building on the aforementioned theoretical
   methodology, a new-generation power grid parallel computing platform
   based on dynamic load balancing technology has been developed. This
   platform employs a distributed computing architecture, integrates the

   supports real-time simulation and analysis of large-scale power systems.
   Currently, this system has been successfully deployed in multiple

AB Oil pipelines are one of the most important modes of modern energy
   transportation, and due to many factors, such as deterioration, aging,
   natural disasters and third-party sabotage in the operation of
   pipelines, leakage accidents and other potential safety hazards are
   frequent, posing a serious threat to the safety of the energy supply
   system. In order to meet this challenge, wireless sensor networks are
   often used to implement online and real-time monitoring of oil
   pipelines, which can compensate for the shortcomings of low efficiency
   of manual inspection and the lack of accuracy of existing leak diagnosis
   technologies in terms of small leaks and multi-source leaks. However,
   factors such as measurement noise interference, differences in sensor
   types, limitations in the number of network nodes, and monitoring
   location layout will lead to the problems of diverse forms, large
   quantities, and complex relationships of the collected detection
   information. In order to ensure that the type of pipeline leakage can be
   accurately judged in a timely manner, the information fusion method
   should be adjusted to achieve the functions of signal noise reduction,
   multi-sensor information fusion and complementarity, and joint
   decisionmaking of multi-sensor identification results [ 1]. In this
   paper, we propose a method for improving the identification of pipe
   leakage types using High and Low Frequency Difference (HLFD) to improve
   the self-attention mechanism driven Long Short-Term Memory Network
   (LSTM) for multi-source data. Based on the structural characteristics of
   the pipeline leakage monitoring network system and the in-depth analysis
   of the characteristics of the detection data, this paper constructs a
   neural network model based on the HLFD method of selfattention driven
   LSTM, which uses the feature-level multi-source data fusion method. In
   the initial stage of data processing, we use wavelet transform
   technology to pre-process the leakage signal and extract key data
   features. Subsequently, at the feature processing level, we use the
   improved self-attention-driven LSTM model to comprehensively analyze the
   preliminary recognition results from multiple nodes to achieve more
   accurate joint decision-making. Firstly, the high-dimensional feature
   vectors were constructed by extracting the features of the pressure data
   under different working conditions. Subsequently, the self-attention
   driven LSTM model was used to train the pressure change data. Finally,
   the abnormal pressure data and flow data identified by classification
   are used to identify the specific working conditions, so as to realize
   the leakage alarm function. This method not only improves the accuracy
   of pipeline leakage identification, but also provides effective support
   for timely response to potential leakage risks.

AB With the increasing reliance on digital surveys for data collection,
   ensuring the accuracy and validity of responses is becoming more
   critical. Traditional surveys, relying on static choice options, often
   fail to capture individuals' full intentions or reveal insights in their
   decisionmaking process. For instance, when an individual hesitates
   between two possible answers but must choose only one, such information
   is not visible in surveys. For this reason, the following paper
   introduces a novel mobile gaze-tracking application designed to enhance
   survey data quality by incorporating eye gaze data as a weighting factor
   to uncover subconscious decision-making processes. Our approach utilizes
   the front camera of mobile devices to dynamically track eye movements,
   adjusting the weight of responses accordingly. This real-time gaze
   tracking, enabled without additional hardware and compatible with mobile
   systems, is both accessible and cost-effective, making it feasible for
   widespread use in various research contexts. By integrating gaze data,
   our method provides a richer and more comprehensive understanding of
   decision-making processes in surveys, reducing biases inherent in
   self-reported data.

AB Applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy is a widely used intervention

   The system collects and analyzes physiological, environmental, and

   educator perceptions using empirical data and qualitative feedback.
   Results indicate that the system achieved a predictive accuracy of
   88.83% and a precision of 86.64% in forecasting learning outcomes, with

AB The existing decision-making system has problems such as low efficiency
   of multi-source heterogeneous data fusion and insufficient real-time
   decision-making accuracy. This paper improves the performance of the
   decision model by constructing a hybrid framework of fusion data
   preprocessing, ensemble learning and deep reinforcement learning. First,
   the distributed data cleaning technology based on MapReduce is used to
   process TB-level industrial sensor data to remove outliers and redundant
   information. Then, a dual-channel feature extraction structure is
   designed on the e-commerce user behavior dataset to compress the feature
   representation dimension to 23% of the original data. Subsequently, an
   improved deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is introduced to
   optimize the decision strategy through a dynamic reward function, and a
   fraud recognition accuracy rate of 92.5% is achieved in a financial risk
   control simulation experiment. The online decision-making system finally
   deployed can process an average of 15,628 real-time data per second in
   the logistics scheduling scenario, and the average decision delay is
   controlled at 46.5ms, which verifies that the model improves data
   processing efficiency in complex scenarios and provides a scalable
   technical framework for cross-domain intelligent decision-making
   systems.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved significantly since its
   inception in the mid-20th century. With the advent of powerful
   computational resources and the accumulation of large-scale datasets in
   the 21st century, deep learning has achieved groundbreaking
   advancements, leading to the development of models such as convolutional
   neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
   attention-based models, and diffusion models. One of the most
   transformative applications of AI is in medical imaging, where AI-driven
   techniques have significantly enhanced disease screening, diagnosis,
   treatment planning, and prognosis evaluation. Despite these
   advancements, AI models often function as "black boxes", making them
   difficult to explain, thereby hindering their clinical adoption. The
   lack of transparency in AI-driven decision-making reduces trust among
   healthcare professionals, posing a critical barrier to widespread
   clinical implementation. To address this challenge, explainable AI (XAI)
   has emerged as a crucial research domain aimed at enhancing model
   explainability and trustworthiness. XAI techniques can be categorized
   based on explanation type (intrinsic vs. post-hoc), explanation
   specificity (model-specific vs. model-agnostic), and explanation scope
   (global vs. local). Intrinsic explainability is inherent in simpler
   models such as linear regression and decision trees, whereas post-hoc
   explainability is required for complex deep learning models.
   Model-specific explainability is tailored for particular architectures,
   while model-agnostic approaches, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations
   (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), can
   be applied across different models. Global explanations provide insights
   into overall model behavior, whereas local explanations focus on
   individual predictions. Several XAI methods have been integrated into
   medical imaging analysis to enhance explainability. Feature attribution
   methods, such as deep learning important features (DeepLIFT) and
   occlusion sensitivity analysis, highlight critical regions in medical
   images that influence AI predictions. Saliency-based methods, including
   class activation mapping (CAM) and its extensions (Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++,
   Score-CAM), visualize model attention in CNNs. Attention mechanisms,
   widely utilized in transformer-based architectures, provide enhanced
   feature weighting, improving model explainability. Prototype-based
   explanations identify representative cases within a dataset to
   facilitate human comprehension of AI decisions, while counterfactual
   explanations explore alternative scenarios to reveal causal
   relationships. Despite the progress in XAI research, several challenges
   remain. First, explanation quality varies across techniques, with some
   methods generating unreliable or inconsistent explanation. Second,
   computational costs associated with perturbation-based and
   sampling-intensive methods limit their real-time applicability. Third, a
   trade-off often exists between model accuracy and explainability,
   necessitating innovative solutions to balance both aspects. Finally,
   integrating XAI techniques into clinical workflows requires robust
   evaluation metrics that align with human-centered decision-making
   processes. Future research should focus on optimizing XAI algorithms for
   medical applications by reducing computational overhead, improving
   causal inference, and enhancing multimodal data integration to
   facilitate transparent and trustworthy AI-driven healthcare solutions.

AB Significance Digital twin technology has emerged as a transformative
   approach to bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds,
   enabling unprecedented levels of intelligence, automation, and
   optimization in complex systems. In the context of optical communication
   networks, the rapid growth of data traffic driven by new applications
   such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud
   computing, and ultra-high-definition video imposes stringent
   requirements on network capacity, latency, reliability, and flexibility.
   Traditional optical networks, while benefiting from advances in coherent
   transmission, elastic optical networks, and software-defined networking,
   still face challenges such as conservative link configurations, static
   control mechanisms, and resource over-provisioning during fault
   recovery. These limitations hinder the efficient utilization of spectrum
   resources and the realization of intelligent, dynamic network
   management. Digital twin technology offers a solution by enabling
   real-time, high-fidelity mapping of the physical network into a digital
   word, supporting accurate perception, prediction, and intelligent
   decision-making throughout the entire network lifecycle. This paradigm
   shift is essential for evolving from passive maintenance to proactive,
   autonomous operation in next-generation optical networks. Progress
   Significant advances have been made in the development of digital twin
   technologies for intelligent optical networks, particularly in two core
   areas: high-precision physical-layer modeling and data-driven
   self-learning. For physical-layer modeling, a modular approach is widely
   adopted, where each network element-such as fibers, erbium-doped fiber
   amplifiers (EDFAs), Raman amplifiers (RAs), and wavelength selective
   switches (WSSs)-is independently modeled and then integrated to
   construct an end-to-end digital representation of the optical link (Fig.
   1). Traditional white-box models are based on physical principles. For
   instance, the Manakov equation and the Gaussian noise (GN) model can be
   utilized to model fiber nonlinearity. Ordinary differential equations
   (ODEs) can be used to model EDFAs and RAs. Though these white-box models
   provide strong interpretability, they are often constrained by
   computational complexity and idealized assumptions. To overcome the
   limitations of white-box models, black-box models leveraging machine
   learning techniques such as neural networks have been introduced,
   achieving high prediction accuracy and computational efficiency while
   closely matching the results of conventional simulations (Figs. 3 and
   7). Furthermore, grey-box models that combine physical knowledge with
   data-driven learning have demonstrated improved accuracy, robustness,
   and generalizability by integrating the strengths of both white-box and
   black-box approaches. This modeling paradigm has been successfully
   applied to the characterization of fibers, EDFAs, and RAs, where
   advanced machine learning methods such as active learning significantly
   reduce the required training data without sacrificing accuracy (Figs. 5,
   8, and 9). Similar strategies have been extended to the modeling of
   filtering penalty, further enhancing the accuracy of optical network
   digital twins. After developing accurate physical models, data-driven
   self-learning becomes an essential technique for the deployment and
   continuous evolution of these models. This approach enables digital
   twins to autonomously adapt to dynamic network environments and maintain
   high modeling accuracy over time.
   The self-learning process primarily involves three key research aspects:
   telemetry, model inaccuracy correction, and input parameter uncertainty
   refinement. First, telemetry-driven data acquisition focuses on the
   real-time collection and integration of multi-source data from both the
   optical and digital domains. In addition to deploying devices such as
   optical power meters within optical links for monitoring purposes,
   acquiring real-time data from the digital signal processor (DSP) at the
   receiver has become a crucial approach. This method enables the
   real-time perception of multiple key metrics, including optical power
   evolution, nonlinear interference (Fig. 10), and filtering impairments
   (Fig. 11), thus providing a solid data foundation for the effective
   operation of subsequent self-learning algorithms. Second, in terms of
   model inaccuracy correction, techniques such as transfer learning and
   active learning have demonstrated the ability to significantly enhance
   the generalization and adaptability of models in real-world scenarios.
   Characterized by small sample sizes, the data dependency and training
   costs associated with large-scale deployment of digital twin systems can
   be reduced (Figs. 12 and 13). Third, input parameter refinement
   techniques further formulate the uncertainty in input parameters as an
   optimization problem. By applying suitable optimization algorithms and
   various refining paradigms, uncertainties in the input parameters can be
   reduced, thereby reducing the impact of measurement noise and incomplete
   information on model performance (Figs. 14 and 15). Conclusions and
   Prospects Digital twin technology is revolutionizing the management and
   optimization of optical communication networks by providing a dynamic,
   high-fidelity virtual representation of the physical infrastructure. The
   combination of physical-layer modeling and data-driven self-learning
   significantly enhances the accuracy, adaptability, and intelligence of
   network operations. Future research will focus on improving model
   scalability, data ecosystem integration, and trustworthiness. Challenges
   such as data sparsity, cross-domain generalization, and real-time
   deployment have yet to be solved. In the future, addressing these
   challenges through joint efforts among academia, industry, and research
   organizations will be essential for realizing the paradigm shift from
   passive maintenance to proactive prediction in optical network
   operations, thereby laying a solid foundation for the next generation of
   intelligent communication infrastructure.

   transfer learning                from pre-trained CNNs, such as ResNet
   (Residual                Network) or VGG (Vanishing Gradient Problem) to
   fine-tune the model for Parkinson disease                detection. The
   explainable AI (XAI) features, such                as GradCAM heatmaps
   are incorporated. The computer                vision techniques are

   diagnostics that can be integrated into existing               
   Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. The system                is
   adapted for longitudinal studies, analyzing                sequential
   images from the same patient to track                the progression of

   ADVANTAGE - By analyzing not only brain scans but also               
   non-invasive indicators like gait analysis and                motor
   function, the system provides a holistic and                more
   accurate detection of Parkinson disease,                especially in
   the early stages when motor symptoms                are more subtle. The
   system, powered by CNNs, is                designed to spot early
   biomarkers of Parkinson                disease in imaging data, enabling
   earlier and                potentially more effective intervention. The
   model                uses CNNs to automatically learn the intricate,    
   subtle features in images that are difficult for               
   clinicians to detect manually, offering a proactive

   from pre-trained CNNs (such as ResNet or                VGG) to
   fine-tune the model for Parkinson disease                detection. This
   reduces the amount of labeled data                required and enhances
   the model's generalizability.                The system uses
   sophisticated data augmentation                techniques (rotation,
   flipping, scaling, etc.) to                artificially increase the
   dataset's size, improving                model robustness and reducing
   overfitting, which is                critical in medical imaging tasks.
   The tools                highlight the regions of the image that the
   model                focuses on when making a diagnosis, making the     
   decision process more transparent and interpretable                for
   clinicians. The integration of explainability                ensures
   that healthcare providers can trust and                validate the
   system's predictions, addressing a                major barrier in the
   adoption of AI in healthcare.                By analyzing visual data
   from sources like video                clips or patient interactions,
   the model introduces                a non-invasive, real-time assessment
   method, which                is less commonly explored in Parkinson
   disease                diagnosis. The system is designed to work within 
   clinical workflows, providing automated diagnostics                that
   can be integrated into existing Electronic                Health Record
   (EHR) systems. This enables                healthcare providers to
   access AI powered                diagnostic predictions alongside
   traditional                medical data. The integration helps bridge
   the gap                between AI predictions and physician             
   decision-making, allowing the model to act as an               
   assistive tool rather than a replacement,                ultimately
   increasing the likelihood of adoption in                medical
   settings. The system leverages                computational efficiency,
   enabling deployment on                both cloud platforms and edge
   devices. By reducing                the reliance on expensive imaging
   equipment and                processing power, the model opens the door
   to                cost-effective, widespread adoption, especially in    
   resource-limited settings or remote healthcare               
   environments. The design choice ensures that the                model
   could be deployed globally, even in                underserved regions
   with limited access to high-end                medical technologies.

AB Background: Diabetic crises, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and
   hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), are acute, life- threatening
   conditions requiring prompt and effective management. Both conditions
   are associated with significant electrolyte disturbances, including
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and acidosis, which can lead to severe
   complications if not managed quickly. These complications may cause
   significant damage to the brain. Objective: This study aims to evaluate
   management strategies for electrolyte disturbances and complications
   associated with diabetic crises, focusing on the role of standard and
   advanced diagnostic imaging in assessing brain conditions and examining
   the impact of ketoacidosis brain damage through case studies.
   Additionally, it assesses the role of health informatics and artificial
   intelligence in improving diagnosis and treatment. Methods: A
   comprehensive review was conducted of current clinical guidelines and
   management practices for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar
   hyperglycemic state. Data was collected from recent literature on
   electrolyte replacement, bicarbonate therapy, and complications
   associated with diabetic crises. The review also included an analysis of
   the role of health informatics in managing these conditions, with
   emphasis on data integration, decision support systems, and remote
   monitoring. Furthermore, several diagnostic cases were examined using
   MRI and imaging to study the anatomical and functional brain changes in
   patients with ketoacidosis conditions. Results: Effective management of
   diabetic crises requires careful monitoring and electrolyte replacement,
   with potassium and phosphate being critical. Bicarbonate therapy should
   be used selectively due to its potential negative effects. Common
   complications include seizures, organ failure, and brain edema, which
   require vigilant monitoring. Health informatics enhances patient care
   through data management, decision support, and remote monitoring, while
   artificial intelligence techniques show promise in improving diagnostic
   accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion: Comprehensive management of
   diabetic crises involves addressing electrolyte imbalances and
   preventing complications. Data reveals changes in brain structure and
   function in affected individuals, with health informatics and artificial
   intelligence serving as valuable tools that enhance the management and
   outcomes of these critical conditions by facilitating accurate
   diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and data-driven decision-making.

AB Aiming at the problems of data isolation, poor real-time performance,
   low efficiency, and lack of intelligent cooperation in traditional
   operation and maintenance, this paper proposes a distributed cooperative
   operation and maintenance control platform based on information
   processing. Through the steps of data distributed collection,
   pre-processing, fusion analysis, and dynamic resource allocation, the
   data processing efficiency, system response speed, resource utilization,
   and decision accuracy are significantly improved. The experimental
   results show that compared with the traditional method, the platform
   improves the data processing efficiency to 500GB/hour, the system
   response time to 2 s, the resource utilization rate to 68.75%, and the
   decision accuracy to 90%, which significantly enhances the intelligence
   and real-time of operation and maintenance control.

   optimizing data is generated. The                linkage optimization
   data is inputted into a risk                prediction model. The

   NOVELTY - The method involves using a surrounding               
   environment perception module to obtain real-time               
   surrounding environment data. The real-time                surrounding
   environment data is processed through                the data processing
   unit including filtering,                denoising, standardizing data,
   feature extraction                and data fusion, and obtain feature
   fusion data.                The feature fusion data is analyzed using
   machine                learning algorithms through the decision support 
   system. The current surrounding environment of the                civil
   defense door is determined, and the final                control
   decision is outputted. The final control                decision is the
   basic control decision                corresponding to the environment,
   if the current                surrounding environment is one
   environment. The                final control decision is a combination
   of basic                control decisions corresponding to multiple     
   environments, if the current surrounding                environment is a
   combination of multiple                environments.
