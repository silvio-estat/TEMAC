It is evident that challenges such as information overload and the semantic gap between physical measurements and operational directives often impede response times during critical events, such as fault diagnosis and disaster recovery. The proposed integrated framework integrates STURM (Spatio-Temporal Unified Representation Model) with HASM (Hierarchical Attention Summarization Mechanism), herein referred to as STURM-HASM. The STURM layer constructs a dynamic heterogeneous graph to unify representations of physical grid assets, real-time operational parameters, and dispatcher commands, capturing their spatio-temporal dynamics. The HASM layer incorporates a dual-channel generator, with a rule-based channel that ensures strict adherence to power system safety standards, and a neural channel that generates fluent natural language summaries using a hierarchical attention mechanism. The dynamic fusion module under discussion is capable of adapting operational safety constraints in such a manner as to achieve a balanced state of semantic fluency. Extensive evaluations on power system-specific datasets, including a custom PowerGrid-NET, demonstrate the framework's efficacy. The system has been demonstrated to achieve 95.1% accuracy in the identification of equipment anomalies, a summary quality (ROUGE-L) of 0.83, and a 40% improvement in the recall of key information. It is imperative to note that the system exhibits a response latency of less than 200 ms, thereby satisfying the real-time requirements of grid dispatch. A digital twin simulation at the provincial level demonstrated a 50% reduction in fault analysis time, thereby significantly enhancing power system emergency management. © The Author(s) 2026.","Domain knowledge enhancement; Grid operation & emergency decision support; Multi-source power data fusion; Power grid fault summary generation; Power grid monitoring & fault diagnosis; Spatio-temporal modeling for power systems","Civil defense; Data acquisition; Decision making; Decision support systems; Disasters; Electric fault currents; Electric load dispatching; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Semantics; Domain knowledge; Domain knowledge enhancement; Emergency decision support; Faults diagnosis; Grid fault; Grid monitoring; Grid operation; Grid operation & emergency decision support; Monitoring diagnosis; Multi-source power data fusion; Multi-Sources; Power; Power data; Power grid fault summary generation; Power grid monitoring & fault diagnose; Power grids; Spatio-temporal modeling for power system; Spatio-temporal models; Summary generation; Phasor measurement units; Risk management","","","","","Shenzhen Polytechnic, SZPT","2025 Shenzhen Polytechnic University Research Fund \""Research on Key Methods for Analysis and Prediction of Social Behavior of Specific Characters on Multimodal Big Data (6025310008\u00A0K)\"".","Tapia-Tinoco, Juan, Real-time harmonic state estimation of power systems using optimal placement of measurement devices through RT-LAB implementation, Electrical Engineering, 106, 5, pp. 6409-6421, (2024); Kotha, Sravan Kumar, Dynamic state estimation of power system using hybrid whale-tunicate optimized unscented Kalman filter based on wide area measurement systems, Electric Power Systems Research, 230, (2024); Goleijani, Sassan, Neural network-based power system dynamic state estimation using hybrid data from SCADA and phasor measurement units, International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems, 28, 2, (2018); International Conference on Mechanical Engineering Measurement Control and Instrumentation, (2021); Yang, Mengxiu, GNSS and accelerometer data fusion by variational Bayesian adaptive multi-rate Kalman filtering for dynamic displacement estimation of super high-rise buildings, Engineering Structures, 325, (2025); Dagal, Idriss, Hierarchical multi step Gray Wolf optimization algorithm for energy systems optimization, Scientific Reports, 15, 1, (2025); Liu, Jingxuan, A hybrid meteorological data simulation framework based on time-series generative adversarial network for global daily solar radiation estimation, Renewable Energy, 219, (2023); Yuan, Yubai, Optimal Transport based Cross-Domain Integration for Heterogeneous Data, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 120, 551, pp. 1449-1462, (2025); Cao, Yuzhe, DDRGS2S: A novel spatiotemporal correlation-based deep learning model for wind power prediction, Energy, 338, (2025); Wang, Hong, Cross-modal knowledge guided model for abstractive summarization, Complex and Intelligent Systems, 10, 1, pp. 577-594, (2024)","J.

Digital twin technology, creating real-time virtual replicas through continuous data integration, represents a transformative shift in managing acute conditions, resource allocation, and outcome prediction in emergency medicine. Aim: This review examines the current applications, benefits, challenges, and future directions of digital twin technology in emergency care and medicine, highlighting its potential to revolutionise emergency healthcare delivery. Method: A comprehensive narrative literature review was conducted using PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Studies published between January 2015 and June 2025 focusing on digital twin applications in emergency departments, trauma care, critical care, and prehospital emergency services were included. Grey literature, conference proceedings, and technical reports were also reviewed to capture emerging developments. Results: Digital twins demonstrate significant utility across multiple emergency care domains including patient monitoring, resource allocation, workflow optimisation, predictive analytics, and training simulations. Key applications include real time patient condition prediction, emergency department capacity management, trauma response coordination, and personalised treatment planning. Despite promising outcomes, implementation challenges persist, including data integration complexities, computational requirements, and regulatory considerations. Conclusion: Digital twin technology holds substantial promise for enhancing emergency care delivery through improved decision support, resource optimisation, and predictive capabilities. Continued research, standardisation efforts, and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential for successful clinical integration and widespread adoption. © 2025 The Authors","Digital twin; Emergency department; Emergency medicine; Healthcare technology; Predictive analytics","Civil defense; Data integration; Decision making; Decision support systems; Digital twin; Emergency services; Integration; Medicine; Patient treatment; Predictive analytics; Resource allocation; Technological forecasting; Acute cares; Critical care units; Emergency care; Emergency departments; Emergency medicine; Healthcare technology; Hospital service; Real- time; Resources allocation; Time-critical; Emergency rooms; advance care planning; clinical decision making; cognitive load; data integration; digital twin; emergency care; emergency medicine; emergency ward; evidence gap; health care delivery; hospital discharge; human; injury; intensive care; medical education; medical technology; outcome assessment; patient care; patient monitoring; personalized care; resource allocation; resource management; Review; shared decision making; simulation training; total quality management; treatment outcome; treatment planning; digital technology; emergency health service; hospital emergency service; Digital Technology; Emergency Medical Services; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans","","","","","","","J Faculty Med, (2024); Cureus, (2024); Li, Haoran, Advancing Emergency Care With Digital Twins, JMIR Aging, 8, (2025); Gopal, Gayatri, Digital transformation in healthcare - Architectures of present and future information technologies, Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, 57, 3, pp. 328-335, (2019); Yazdi, Mohammad, Advances in Computational athematics for Industrial System Reliability and Maintainability, Springer Series in Reliability Engineering, Part F2334, pp. 1-190, (2024); Vallée, Alexandre, Digital twin for healthcare systems, Frontiers in Digital Health, 5, (2023); Lǎzǎroiu, George, Generative artificial intelligence-driven medical digital twin technologies in blockchain Internet of Things wearable sensor and computer vision-based extended reality healthcare metaverse, Engineering Management in Production and Services, 17, 3, pp. 27-50, (2025); Chaparro-Cárdenas, Silvia Liliana, A Technological Review of Digital Twins and Artificial Intelligence for Personalized and Predictive Healthcare, Healthcare (Switzerland), 13, 14, (2025); Adibi, Sasan, Enhancing Healthcare through Sensor-Enabled Digital Twins in Smart Environments: A Comprehensive Analysis, Sensors, 24, 9, (2024); J Health Care Sci, (2024)","D.B.

Effectively fusing these diverse sources is essential for achieving resilient, efficient, and sustainable operations. In this paper, we present a Fusion-based Unified Security and Energy efficiency approach for Industrial Systems (FUSE-IS), a novel multi-modal data fusion framework. FUSE-IS integrates deep learning-based threat detection, differential privacy mechanisms, and carbon-aware resource scheduling. It enhances security, privacy, and energy efficiency in industrial energy environments. Unlike traditional solutions that address these objectives in isolation, FUSE-IS employs a unified data fusion approach that combines these solutions. As a result, it enabled real-time adaptive decision-making for threat mitigation, data protection, and carbon-optimized computing. Experimental results demonstrate that FUSE-IS achieves 98.5 % detection accuracy with only 1.2 % false positives, while reducing energy consumption by 24 % and carbon emissions by 20 % compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains strong privacy guarantees (ϵ = 0.9) with minimal accuracy degradation (0.7 %). A case study on DDoS mitigation illustrates FUSE-IS's ability to dynamically adjust defense strategies based on carbon intensity fluctuations, resulting in a 27 % emission reduction during the attack window. © 2025 The Authors","Energy efficiency optimization; Multisource data fusion; Renewable energy integration; Smart grid security","Carbon; Data fusion; Data privacy; Differential privacy; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Modal analysis; Network security; Energy; Energy efficiency optimizations; Heterogeneous data; Industrial energy system; Industrial systems; Multi-modal data; Multisource data; Multisource data fusion; Renewable energy integrations; Smart grids security; Decision making","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; (2022A-097-G); (2024039); University of Nottingham Ningbo China, UNNC, (B0166); University of Nottingham Ningbo China, UNNC; Department of Science and Technology of Liaoning Province, (2025JH2/101330069); Department of Science and Technology of Liaoning Province","This work is partially supported by the Yongjiang Technology Innovation Project (2022A-097-G), Zhejiang Department of Transportation General Research and Development Project (2024039), National Natural Science Foundation of China grant (UNNC ID: B0166), and Applied Basic Research Program of the Department of Science and Technology of Liaoning Province (2025JH2/101330069).","undefined, (2024); Khalil, Ruhul Amin, Deep Learning in the Industrial Internet of Things: Potentials, Challenges, and Emerging Applications, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 14, pp. 11016-11040, (2021); J Inform Secur Applic, (2023); Rehman, Ateeq Ur, FEDge-HAR: An Optimized Private Mobile Edge-Enabled IoT Paradigm for Privacy of Human Activity Recognition, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 11, 24, pp. 40909-40920, (2024); Comput Secur, (2023); Humayed, Abdulmalik, Cyber-Physical Systems Security - A Survey, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 4, 6, pp. 1802-1831, (2017); Altan, Gökhan, SecureDeepNet-IoT: A deep learning application for invasion detection in industrial Internet of Things sensing systems, Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies, 32, 4, (2021); Hussain, Alaa, Machine Learning in IoT Security: Current Solutions and Future Challenges, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 22, 3, pp. 1686-1721, (2020); Khan, Fazlullah, Trustworthy and Reliable Deep-Learning-Based Cyberattack Detection in Industrial IoT, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 19, 1, pp. 1030-1038, (2023); De, Suparna, Deep Generative Models in the Industrial Internet of Things: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 18, 9, pp. 5728-5737, (2022)","F.

However, traditional rehearsal methods, such as military chess simulations, are inefficient and inflexible, with particularly pronounced limitations in command and decision-making. The overwhelming volume of information and high decision complexity hinder the realization of autonomous and agile command and control. To address this challenge, an intelligent warfare simulation framework named Command-Agent is proposed, which deeply integrates large language models (LLMs) with digital twin battlefields. By constructing a highly realistic battlefield environment through real-time simulation and multi-source data fusion, the natural language interaction capabilities of LLMs are leveraged to lower the command threshold and to enable autonomous command through the Observe–Orient–Decide–Act (OODA) feedback loop. Within the Command-Agent framework, a multi-model collaborative architecture is further adopted to decouple the decision-generation and command-execution functions of LLMs. By combining specialized models such as DeepSeek-R1 and MCTool, the limitations of single-model capabilities are overcome. MCTool is a lightweight execution model fine-tuned for military Function Calling tasks. The framework also introduces a Vector Knowledge Base to mitigate hallucinations commonly exhibited by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that Command-Agent not only enables natural language-driven simulation and control but also deeply understands commander intent. Leveraging the multi-model collaborative architecture, during red-blue UAV confrontations involving 2 to 8 UAVs, the integrated score is improved by an average of 41.8% compared to the single-agent system (MCTool), accompanied by a 161.8% optimization in the battle loss ratio. Furthermore, when compared with multi-agent systems lacking the knowledge base, the inclusion of the Vector Knowledge Base further improves overall performance by 16.8%. In comparison with the general model (Qwen2.5–7B), the fine-tuned MCTool leads by 5% in execution efficiency. Therefore, the proposed Command-Agent introduces a novel perspective to the military command system and offers a feasible solution for intelligent battlefield decision-making. © 2025 China Ordnance Society","Digital twin battlefield; Large language models; Military command; Multi-agent system","Autonomous agents; Command and control systems; Computer simulation languages; Decision making; Digital twin; Intelligent agents; Military applications; National security; Natural language processing systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Collaborative architectures; Decisions makings; Digital twin battlefield; International affairs; Language model; Large language model; Military command; Multi-modelling; Multiagent systems (MASs); Warfare simulations; Multi agent systems","","","","","","","Tao, Fei, Digital Twins and Cyber–Physical Systems toward Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: Correlation and Comparison, Engineering, 5, 4, pp. 653-661, (2019); Bennington, Robert W., Joint Simulation System (JSIMS) an overview, IEEE Proceedings of the National Aerospace and Electronics Conference, 2, pp. 804-809, (1995); Wittman, Robert L., Case tool integration and utilization within the joint theater level simulation (JTLS), Winter Simulation Conference Proceedings, pp. 1147-1151, (1995); Proceedings of the 15th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, (2010); Ma, Weiyu, Large Language Models Play StarCraft II: Benchmarks and A Chain of Summarization Approach, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 37, (2024); Arxiv Preprint Arxiv 240201118, (2024); Masri, Sari, Large Language Models (LLMs) as Traffic Control Systems at Urban Intersections: A New Paradigm, Vehicles, 7, 1, (2025); Bakhtin, Anton, Human-level play in the game of Diplomacy by combining language models with strategic reasoning, Science, 378, 6624, pp. 1067-1074, (2022); Foundation Models for Decision Making Problems Methods and Opportunities, (2023); Brief Analysis of Deepseek R1 and Its Implications for Generative Ai, (2025)","M.

However, in military target detection—where battlefield samples are exceptionally sparse—the cross-domain generalization of models trained on synthetic data remains empirically unverified. This research aims to explore the mechanisms underlying the cross-domain generalization of synthetic data, with a particular emphasis on tank target detection from unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV)perspectives. A key contribution of this study is the development of the synthetic tank(ST)1. 0 dataset, which comprises three distinct subsets(ST1, ST2, and ST3), each containing 1 600 images. These subsets are differentiated by their data sources and exhibit varying levels of simulation precision and scenario realism. This tiered design enables the deconstruction of the“domain gap”to quantify the effect of different types of synthetic data on model generalization. Ultimately, this research seeks to provide quantitative and qualitative insights into how synthetic data can be leveraged to train object detectors for practical deployment in modern weapon systems. Method To rigorously evaluate the cross-domain generalization of models trained on synthetic data, this study proposes a multilayered validation framework and a structured experimental design. The three-level validation framework systematically assesses performance across domains: 1)synthetic domain: models are tested on reserved synthetic subsets(e. g. , models trained on ST1 are evaluated on the ST1 test set), establishing a performance benchmark in a controlled “ideal” setting to quantify basic synthetic-domain capabilities. 2)Real domain: performance is evaluated using public real-world military tank datasets comprising 41 images, with 11 sourced from ImageNet and 30 from Open Images V7. This step quantifies the initial synthetic-to-real domain discrepancy, elucidating the challenges in transitioning from controlled synthetic environments to real-world scenarios. 3) Combat domain: models are evaluated on a proprietary dataset consisting of UAV-acquired imagery collected from combat areas. This dataset contains 1 000 images depicting complex combat scenarios and is designed to serve as a rigorous benchmark for assessing model generalization and battlefield adaptability. To mitigate architecture-specific biases, we evaluate three representative heterogeneous object detectors: cascade R-CNN is a two stage anchor-based model that enhances proposal accuracy through cascaded regression and classification. YOLOv10 is a single-stage detector optimized for latency-sensitive applications while maintaining competitive precision. RT-DETR is a real-time Transformer-based architecture that leverages global self-attention to model long-range dependencies. Further⁃more, we incorporate a contemporary state-of-the-art detector, YOLOv12, as an additional performance benchmark. The experimental design is structured around three research inquiries: 1)synthetic domain discrepancy: this inquiry analyzes how model performance varies when trained on ST1, ST2, or ST3 and evaluated using the three-level validation framework, directly assessing the influence of different synthetic domains on generalization. 2)Mixed synthetic strategies: this aspect investigates the effects of training on mixed datasets, aiming to determine whether combining samples from multiple synthetic domains can enhance model robustness and generalization capabilities. 3)Data augmentation efficacy: this inquiry examines the effectiveness of using data from one synthetic domain to augment training on another. This approach systematically assesses whether cross-domain data augmentation can further improve generalization and mitigate domain-specific biases. Result Experimental investigations provided insights into the intricate relationship between synthetic data and real-world model performance. First, across all evaluated architectures, model performance—as measured by average precision —declined significantly when moving from controlled synthetic environments to real-world scenarios and further to the highly unpredictable combat domain. This trend clearly highlights the pronounced effect of the domain gap. Second, among the three detectors, RT-DETR consistently exhibited greater cross-domain robustness, with performance degrading more gradually in real-world and combat domains in comparison with the other detectors. Third, the generalization capability of models can be substantially enhanced through the incorporation of high-quality synthetic data. Such data are characterized by three critical attributes: photorealistic fidelity, adaptability to target-domain attributes, and close alignment with the feature distribution of real-world data. These qualities collectively ensure that synthetic data not only visually resemble real data but also effectively capture the underlying characteristics and variability of the target domain, thereby facilitating improved model robustness and transferability across diverse operational scenarios. Fourth, model performance can be further improved by incorporating high-quality synthetic data through data mixing or augmentation strategies. These methods effectively reduce overfitting on dataset-specific characteristics by introducing data distributions that closely mirror those of the target domain. Conclusion Research has demonstrated that synthetic data can partially alleviate the scarcity of real-world data in the military domain, providing critical support for the practical deployment of weapon systems. However, synthetic data continue to exhibit inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization. Future research should prioritize the collaborative construction of multisource heterogeneous datasets and the deep integration of domain generalization techniques while broadening the research scope to encompass a wider array of military target categories and model architectures. Furthermore, investigating the security boundaries of intelligent data fusion in decision-making processes is essential to establish more scientific and reliable methodologies for constructing military object detection datasets. © 2026, Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG.

To improve the accuracy and efficiency of ballistic trajectory prediction and firing condition inversion, this paper proposes an intelligent prediction framework that fuses deep learning with ensemble optimization. First, a TCN-BiGRU-Attention model is designed for the localization of enemy launch points. Subsequently, a Particle Swarm Optimization - Extreme Learning Machine - Adaptive Boosting (PSO-ELM-AdaBoost) ensemble algorithm is adopted to rapidly derive the optimal firing conditions for striking the identified enemy launch points. Simulation results demonstrate that the TCN-BiGRU-Attention model reduces the comprehensive prediction error regarding range and lateral deviation to 7.89 m in the enemy launch point localization task. Furthermore, the PSO-ELM-AdaBoost algorithm exhibits superior performance in the firing condition inversion task; the prediction errors for the initial firing angle and initial velocity are only 0.06° and 0.058 m/s, respectively, representing accuracy improvements of 50% and 18% compared to the traditional ELM method. By constructing a dual-stage ""trajectory prediction-parameter inversion"" architecture, this study reduces the single-computation time to the millisecond level, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. These results indicate that the proposed framework possesses potential applicability under simulation validation conditions, providing methodological references and theoretical support for the design of sensing data fusion, real-time reasoning, and decision support modules in future C4ISR and Military Internet of Things (MIoT) systems. © 2014 IEEE.","Attention; Convolutional Neural Network; Extreme Learning Machine; Gated Recurrent Unit; Launch Condition Prediction; Launch Point Prediction; Particle Swarm Optimization","Computational efficiency; Data fusion; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Deep learning; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Military operations; Neural networks; Real time systems; Attention; Condition prediction; Convolutional neural network; Extreme learning machine; Gated recurrent unit; Launch condition prediction; Launch conditions; Launch point prediction; Learning machines; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","","","(22KJB590001); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2024M754148, GZB20240980); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; (2022JCJQLB06105); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62203191); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers: 62203191), the Basic Science (Natural Science) Research Projects in Higher Education Institutions (Grant numbers: 22KJB590001), the National Defence Key Laboratory of Science and Technology (Grant numbers: 2022JCJQLB06105), the Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (Grade B) of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant numbers: GZB20240980), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant numbers: 2024M754148).

This paper aims to realize the intelligent closed loop of the whole chain of ""perception - simulation - evaluation - decision - feedback""of the multi-scale water system of ""watershed - city - reservoir"". The core of the framework is multi-field fusion physical information neural Network (MF-PINN). Through the collaboration of multiple subnetworks of Graph Neural Network (GNN), spatio-temporal Transformer and Physical constraint Recurrent Network (RC), physical laws such as Saint Venant's equation and Manning's formula are embedded. At the same time, multi-source heterogeneous data such as Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing and GIS were fused to realize high-precision and efficient hydrological and hydrodynamic simulation. And through the real-time interaction between Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and MF-PINN, a multi-objective optimization scheduling strategy was generated. Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) as a typical research area, four scenarios of ""urban waterlogging prediction, reservoir inflow flood prediction, flood control scheduling decision, and soil and water conservation benefit evaluation""were carried out. The results show that the Intersection over Union (IoU) of MF-PINN reaches 0.92 in the simulation of urban waterlogging area, and the Nash Efficiency Coefficient (NSE) of reservoir inflow flood prediction exceeds 0.85. The computational efficiency of MF-PINN is more than 15 times higher than that of the traditional physical model (such as SWMM). Compared with the traditional rule, the DRL-driven intelligent scheduling strategy reduces disaster by 15%∼20%, and improves the utilization rate of water resources by 10% after flood. The research confirms that the framework breaks through the limitations of the traditional model of ""single scale fragmentation and low efficiency""and the isolated AI application of ""physical instability and decision-making disconnection""through the deep integration of physical mechanism and artificial intelligence, and provides the core technical support for the construction of digital twin of water system and smart water. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Digital twin; Guangdong-hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA); Intelligent scheduling; Multi-source data fusion; Physical-mechanism neural network (PINN); water disaster prevention","Climate change; Data fusion; Decision making; Deep learning; Digital twin; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Flood control; Floods; Neural networks; Reservoirs (water); Soil conservation; Soils; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Waterworks; Bay areas; Guangdong-hong kong-macao great bay area; Hong-kong; Intelligent scheduling; Multi-source data fusion; Multi-Sources; Neural-networks; Physical mechanism; Physical-mechanism neural network; Source data; Water disaster prevention; Water disasters; Computational efficiency","","","","","","","Journal of Environmental Science; Chinese Stereoscopic Imaging and Image Analysis; Journal of Heilongjiang University of Engineering Chinese English Russian; Science and Technology Innovation, (2026); Jilin Water Resources, (2026); Journal of Internet of Things; Zte Communications; Journal of Environmental Science; Electric Power Automation Equipment; Aerospace Medical Journal, (2025)","C.

This connectivity facilitates real-time communication, data sharing, and collaboration among military assets, enhancing situational awareness, decision-making processes, and overall operational effectiveness. The domain for IoBT encompasses a broad range of military assets, from drones and ground vehicles to soldier-worn wearables, sensors, and munitions. These assets are capable of collecting and transmitting critical information from the battlefield, including location data, status updates, environmental conditions, and the movements of adversaries. IoBT networks depend on robust communication networks, secure data transmission protocols, advanced data analytics for processing vast datasets, and seamless integration with command-and-control infrastructures. However, IoBT devices and systems function in dynamic and challenging battlefield conditions which present unique communication challenges. This study aims to review research efforts that provide current state-of-the-art solutions, their limitations, and emerging technologies.

The proposed system introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based control architecture combining fuzzy inference, neuro-emotional learning, and distributed multi-agent coordination. At the core of the approach is a Bidirectional Fuzzy Brain Emotional Learning Prediction (BFBEL-P) model, which integrates fuzzy logic and an online adaptive neural structure to enable trajectory forecasting without pre-training or prior knowledge of the environment. From an engineering perspective, this AI model is deployed in UAV swarm navigation, where robust decision-making, predictive coordination, and obstacle avoidance are essential for target interception missions. In contrast to conventional prediction methods, such as curve fitting, nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), and deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the BFBEL-P framework offers fast convergence, low computational cost, and high adaptability. The system incorporates multi-threaded data fusion across the swarm to achieve consensus-driven predictions and maintain situational awareness, even under sensor failures or occlusions. Simulation results show that BFBEL-P improves short-term prediction accuracy by 82.2%, reduces prediction time by 15%, and achieves a 100% tracking success rate across benchmark scenarios. These results establish BFBEL-P as a reliable AI technique for distributed control in real-world UAV swarm applications, offering a promising tool for search-and-rescue, surveillance, and defense operations. © 2025 The Authors","Adaptive predictive models; Artificial intelligence for trajectory prediction; Distributed information fusion; Dynamic target tracking; Fuzzy neural networks; Obstacle avoidance; Quadrotor systems; Robotic swarms","Aircraft control; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Data fusion; Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Distributed parameter control systems; Drones; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Information fusion; Intelligent agents; Intelligent robots; Multi agent systems; Prediction models; Predictive control systems; Swarm intelligence; Target drones; Trajectories; Adaptive predictive model; Artificial intelligence for trajectory prediction; Distributed information fusion; Dynamic target; Dynamic target tracking; Fuzzy-neural-networks; Obstacles avoidance; Predictive models; Quadrotor systems; Robotic swarms; Targets tracking; Trajectory prediction; Collision avoidance; Fuzzy neural networks","","","","","","","Adriaensen, Steven, Efficient Bayesian Learning Curve Extrapolation using Prior-Data Fitted Networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, (2023); Alsanwy, Shehab, A CNN-LSTM Based Model to Predict Trajectory of Human-Driven Vehicle, Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, pp. 3097-3103, (2023); Altché, Florent, An LSTM network for highway trajectory prediction, IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Proceedings, ITSC, 2018-March, pp. 353-359, (2017); Ukraine and the Problem of Restoring Maneuver in Contemporary War, (2024); Chen, Jin, FB-BiGRU: A Deep Learning model for AIS-based vessel trajectory curve fitting and analysis, Ocean Engineering, 266, (2022); Du, Shuai, Visual positioning system for marine industrial robot assembly based on complex variable function, Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences, 7, 2, pp. 485-492, (2022); Gupta, Agrim, Social GAN: Socially Acceptable Trajectories with Generative Adversarial Networks, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2255-2264, (2018); Jiang, Rui, Spatial-Temporal Attentive LSTM for Vehicle-Trajectory Prediction, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 11, 7, (2022); Khan, Md Mohiuddin, Autonomous detection of collective behaviours in swarms, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 57, (2020); Lee, Der Hau, End-to-end deep learning of lane detection and path prediction for real-time autonomous driving, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 17, 1, pp. 199-205, (2023)","V.P.

This type of data requires special attention in various industries. For instance, in the travel and hospitality sector, businesses monitor customer reviews, travel forums, and social media to assess service quality, satisfaction, and emerging trends. In public safety, national security, and biosurveillance, monitoring online forums, social media, and news outlets is essential for identifying threats, criminal activity, or public safety concerns. Additionally, the challenge of efficiently monitoring unstructured text streams, such as business emails, is a significant issue for large organizations. In this paper, we propose a method that combines natural language processing and text visualization techniques with traditional process monitoring algorithms to enhance the analysis and understanding of text streams. Our method involves mapping text streams onto a bivariate plot, followed by the application of monitoring techniques on a sequence of statistics derived from these plots. This sequential analysis reveals valuable insights into temporal patterns and fluctuations. We integrate, in the proposed method, two robust real-time monitoring procedures—Cumulative Sum and Pruned Exact Linear Time—both widely used for change point detection, allowing the framework to support also retrospective analysis for extracting critical insights. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through simulations and two real-world case studies. The first case study involves the BBC, where the framework is used to detect extreme events through published articles. The second, provided by a shipbroker in Greece, applies the framework to monitor a large volume of emails. Ultimately, the proposed solution provides a comprehensive approach to dynamically monitoring time-varying unstructured text streams, offering organizations a powerful tool for informed decision-making and improved market intelligence. © The Author(s) 2025.","CUSUM; Natural language processing; PELT; Process monitoring of textual data; Text data streams; Text visualization techniques","Crime; Data assimilation; Data integration; Data streams; Metadata; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Reviews; Spatio-temporal data; CUSUM; Data stream; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; PELT; Process monitoring of textual data; Text data; Text data stream; Text visualization; Text visualization technique; Textual data; Visualization technique; Customer satisfaction","","","","","Hellenic Academic Libraries Link, ΣΕΑΒ","Open access funding provided by HEAL-Link Greece.

Existing casualty management tools, such as the Medical Planners Toolkit and Joint Medical Planning Tool, provide static estimates and lack predictive capabilities for evacuation and medical resupply. The Automated Battlefield Trauma System (ABTS) was developed to address these limitations by automating casualty categorization, resource estimation, and Medical Common Operating Picture reporting. METHODS Tested during the US Army I Corps' Warfighter Exercise (WFX) 25-02, ABTS used casualty data derived from the Russo-Ukrainian conflict to estimate critical resource needs for medical units across different echelons. Integrated with Warfighter Simulation data, ABTS provided automated dashboards to track casualty categories, estimate died-of-wounds rates, and predict resource shortages. Initially relying on Excel-based dashboards, late-stage integration with Palantir's Maven Smart Systems enabled enhanced real-time data visualization and decision support for commanders. RESULTS Key takeaways from the proof of concept include the following: (1) automation significantly improves casualty care management in LSCO; (2) ABTS enhances predictive logistics for evacuation and medical resupply; (3) it serves as a critical risk management tool for commanders; and (4) integration with warfighting functions is essential for operational effectiveness. While successful, future iterations must refine casualty modeling, enhance data integration with emerging artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, and expand interoperability with Joint and allied forces. CONCLUSION The Automated Battlefield Trauma System demonstrated its potential to transform battlefield casualty management by leveraging automation and predictive analytics. Continued development will refine its capabilities, improve real-time data integration, and ensure its applicability across military operations, enhancing survivability and operational efficiency in LSCO environments. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The intelligent navigation system is the core of USVs, responsible for environmental perception, decision-making, and motion control, which collectively enable autonomous mission execution and integration into systematic operations. This study provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental technologies underpinning USV intelligent navigation, critically evaluates existing challenges, and proposes future research directions to advance and expand the application of intelligent navigation technologies for USVs. The research aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps, providing a foundation for the further development of autonomous maritime systems. [Method]This research provides a comprehensive review of the current state of intelligent navigation technologies for USVs, focusing on three critical areas: environmental perception, decision-making and planning, and motion control. (a) In the domain of environmental perception, the primary sensing modalities include visible light, infrared, sonar, electromagnetic signals, navigation radar, and LiDAR. With advancements in multi-source information fusion technology, perception techniques have evolved from relying on single sensors to utilizing multi-sensor fusion, transitioning from object-level fusion to feature-level fusion. Despite these advancements, achieving accurate and efficient environmental perception remains a key challenge. The ability to provide real-time, comprehensive environmental awareness is essential for USVs to navigate autonomously in complex maritime conditions. (b) For decision-making and planning, a variety of methodologies, including operations research, optimization algorithms, and AI-based approaches, have been employed to generate optimal decisions under multiple constraints, such as mission parameters, payload configurations, and environmental factors. Existing technologies facilitate global path optimization, target tracking, and emergency collision avoidance under predefined conditions. However, challenges remain in multi-objective adversarial decision-making and path planning in highly dynamic and adversarial environments, especially under strong external interferences. The ability to enhance decision-making robustness in these scenarios is crucial for advancing autonomous USV capabilities. (c) In motion control, various algorithms such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, model predictive control (MPC), model-free adaptive control (MFAC), linear quadratic regulators (LQR), robust control, and sliding mode control have been applied to achieve accurate trajectory tracking, course keeping, and speed regulation. Current advancements allow for precise control under design conditions; however, adaptive control remains a challenge in scenarios with extreme environmental variations. Moreover, effective control of roll and pitch motions remains underdeveloped, limiting USV stability in high sea states. Motion control techniques serve as the foundation of USV intelligent navigation, ensuring the successful implementation of autonomous navigation systems.[Results]The study identifies key limitations. In environmental perception, while current technologies allow for target detection and identification in open seas, their accuracy significantly decreases under adverse weather conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, and high sea states. Real-time wave field perception remains inadequate, further compromising navigation safety in dynamic operational conditions. Decision-making and planning algorithms, though effective in structured mission scenarios, struggle with the complexity of dynamic constraints, adversarial interactions, and unexpected environmental disturbances in real operations. Motion control strategies, while efficient under nominal operating conditions, require enhanced adaptability to handle sudden environmental shifts and complex vessel dynamics. The inability to manage roll and pitch movements effectively limits the operational capability of USVs in high sea states. [Conclusions]To address these challenges, the study proposes four key technological advancements and research directions. First, the development of high-precision six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion modeling for USVs will provide a robust framework for intelligent navigation algorithms. Second, the integration of large-scale AI models for multi-modal perception and decision-making will enhance autonomous situational awareness and adaptive response capabilities. Third, the advancement of high-sea-state adaptive navigation technologies through real-time wave observation and predictive motion modeling will significantly improve USV stability and safety in complex maritime environments. Additionally, the incorporation of real-time optimization techniques will enhance navigation efficiency under operational constraints. These technological developments will not only expand the application scope of USVs but also significantly improve their autonomous navigation capabilities. The study emphasizes the necessity of interdisciplinary research efforts that integrate AI-driven models, control theory, and maritime engineering to accelerate the development of fully autonomous USVs capable of performing in diverse operational conditions. © 2025 Editorial Department of Chinese Journal of Ship Research.

We propose an Adaptive Multi-Modal Vision Transformer (AMVT) framework that employs hybrid transformer + CNN fusion, spatio-temporal attention, and multi-modal sensor fusion, hybrid CNN + Transformer fusion that requires both modalities to be present at all times, multi-modal sensor fusion, as well as a variety of spatio-temporal and intensity attention mechanisms to achieve high precision, segmentation in varying conditions. AMVT segments differently depending on the dynamic feedback loops provided by the environment in low light, fog, occlusion, etc. The Adaptive Real Time Object Refinement (AROR) module based on the use of edge enhanced LiDAR data is a novel scheme to improve the object boundaries, whereas the Self Adaptive Sensor Fusion Network (SASFN) dynamically weights RGB, LiDAR and radar input data to obtain the best detection accuracy. For inference with low latency, the model is optimized for Edge AI, on which it achieves less than 10 ms per frame for segmentation with no loss of accuracy. It is evaluated against new benchmark datasets and shows over 90% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) superior to current deep learning based methods in dynamic object detection. Further, a Meta-Learning Adversarial Defense (MLAD) module quenches adversarial attacks in the real world. Finally, this research offers a scalable, efficient, and resilient segmentation framework for next generation's autonomous driving systems that resolves the key problems in autonomy perception and decision making. Future work is to extend AMVT for working under extreme environmental conditions as well as to learn reinforcement learning based on adaptive driving policies. © 2025 IEEE.","Adaptive Multi-Modal Vision Transformer; Adaptive Real Time Object Refinement; multi-modal sensor fusion; Self-Adaptive Sensor Fusion Network; spatio-temporal attention","Autonomous vehicles; Computer vision; Decision making; Deep learning; Human computer interaction; Hybrid sensors; Learning systems; Object detection; Object recognition; Optical radar; Reinforcement learning; Sensor data fusion; Smart sensors; Adaptive multi-modal vision transformer; Adaptive real time object refinement; Adaptive sensor fusion; Multi-modal; Multi-modal sensor fusion; Multimodal sensor; Object refinement; Real- time; Self-adaptive sensor fusion network; Sensor fusion; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal attention; Image segmentation","","","","","","","Alabyad, Nesma, From Vision to Precision: The Dynamic Transformation of Object Detection in Autonomous Systems, 6th International Conference on Computing and Informatics, ICCI 2024, pp. 332-344, (2024); Madake, Jyoti, A Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Research in Mobility Technologies for Visually Impaired People, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 82496-82520, (2023); IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, (2023); Ramesh, K.

This paper presents an IoT-based framework for Public Safety and Earthquake Disaster Management that leverages the power of real-time sensing, communication, and data analytics to enhance preparedness, response, and recovery. The proposed system integrates a distributed network of seismic and environmental sensors with low-power microcontrollers and wireless communication modules to monitor seismic activity, structural integrity, and environmental conditions. These devices continuously collect data and transmit it to a centralized cloud platform for real-time processing and analysis using machine learning algorithms. In the event of an anomaly or detected seismic event, automated alerts are sent to emergency responders, public authorities, and citizens via mobile applications, SMS, and public announcement systems. The framework also includes a predictive analytics module for early warning and risk assessment, enabling proactive evacuation and resource mobilization. Furthermore, the system supports post-disaster damage assessment through UAV-based image acquisition and integration with GIS data. Emphasis is placed on interoperability, scalability, and low latency communication using protocols such as MQTT and LoRaWAN. The proposed IoT-based disaster management system significantly enhances situational awareness, reduces response time, and ensures efficient coordination among stakeholders during emergencies. This approach holds promise for improving public safety and resilience in earthquake-prone regions by leveraging smart technology for intelligent disaster management and real-time decision-making.

This review aimed to comparatively analyze the functionality, technological characteristics, and applicability of wearable biosensors used for nutritional and physiological monitoring in military and high-performance contexts. A total of 26 scientific articles (2015–2025) indexed in the Web of Science – Core Collection were included based on defined eligibility criteria. Data extraction focused on monitored parameters, transduction technologies, biosensor type, application context, and study design. Each device was assessed using a functional scoring system evaluating portability, accuracy, and operational utility. The results revealed high average scores for portability and field applicability, especially among electrophysiological and optical biosensors. However, most devices focused on cardiovascular, respiratory, and thermoregulatory monitoring, with limited integration of nutrition-specific biomarkers such as glucose, lactate, or salivary analytes. Only a few systems provided truly multimodal tracking. These findings emphasize a significant technological gap in the integration of comprehensive metabolic monitoring within wearable platforms. The analysis also highlights critical innovation priorities: development of autonomous, multisensory biosensors; enhanced energy autonomy; and increased data fusion capacity. In conclusion, wearable biosensors offer promising tools for strengthening physiological resilience, supporting preventive strategies, and improving real-time decision-making in military theaters.

As military applications need to be more secure and the reliable actions need to be taken. For accurate decision making, a huge amount of information from the sensor network is required. Data processing and communication to the user end of the vast amount of data degrades the system performance. Data fusion is a technique that produces the output that represents the information from the multiple sources. This output helps in the decision-making process more efficiently.

However, the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) presents novel opportunities to enhance both the reliability and granularity of these systems. In this paper, we propose WARRIOR (Wireless Autonomous Resilient Reconnaissance and Intelligence Operational Relay), an IoT enabled BFT solution designed to improve soldier safety and situational awareness on the battlefield. WARRIOR integrates low-power sensor nodes, wearable devices, edge processing capabilities, and secure cloud infrastructure to achieve intelligent data fusion and rapid decision making. By leveraging dynamic routing, context aware protocols, and a multi-tier security framework, WARRIOR addresses critical constraints such as limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity, and adversarial threats. Experimental results from a prototype implementation and simulations demonstrate that WARRIOR achieves near-realtime updates, improved position accuracy (within 2-3 meters), and robust resilience against node failures. Our findings suggest that the integration of IoT paradigms into BFT systems can fundamentally transform operational strategy, reduce casualties, and enhance interoperability for joint missions. © 2025 IEEE.","Blue Force Tracking; edge computing; IoT; security; situational awareness; soldier safety; wireless sensor networks","Behavioral research; Edge computing; Internet of things; Military communications; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Real time systems; Wearable sensors; Blue force trackers; Blue Force Tracking; Blue Force Tracking systems; Security; Sensors network; Situational awareness; Soldier safety; Tactical decision makings; Wireless sensor; Decision making","","","","","","","Chen, Shanzhi, A vision of IoT: Applications, challenges, and opportunities with China Perspective, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 1, 4, pp. 349-359, (2014); Samie, Farzad, Iot technologies for embedded computing: A survey, Proceedings of the 11th IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis, CODES 2016, (2016); Xu, Lida, Internet of things in industries: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 10, 4, pp. 2233-2243, (2014); Román, Rodrigo, Securing the Internet of things, Computer, 44, 9, pp. 51-58, (2011); Güngör, Vehbi Çağrı, Industrial wireless sensor networks: Challenges, design principles, and technical approaches, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 56, 10, pp. 4258-4265, (2009); Jain, Saurabh, Blockchain and Autonomous Vehicles: Recent Advances and Future Directions, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 130264-130328, (2021); Baccelli, Emmanuel, RIOT: An Open Source Operating System for Low-End Embedded Devices in the IoT, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5, 6, pp. 4428-4440, (2018); Mane, Priyanka Makrand, IoT Framework for Modern Battlefield : Implementation of Soldiers Health Integration for Enhanced Location Deployment (SHIELD) System, 2024 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Computing and Machine Intelligence, ICMI 2024 - Proceedings, (2024); Olasupo, Tajudeen Olawale, Wireless communication modeling for the deployment of tiny iot devices in rocky and mountainous environments, IEEE Sensors Letters, 3, 7, (2019); Computer Communications Workshops INFOCOM Wkshps 2013 IEEE Conference on, (2013)","P.

The overall framework of this method includes situational awareness module, information fusion module, intelligent decision-making module and task execution module. Through the cooperation of all modules, real-time awareness of battlefield situation, efficient information fusion, intelligent decision-making and accurate task execution can be realized. In the aspect of situation awareness and information fusion, UAV obtains real-time battlefield situation information through various sensors, and uses D-S evidence theory to fuse multi-source data, effectively dealing with redundancy and conflict between data, and improving the accuracy and reliability of target detection. In the design of intelligent decision-making algorithm, a decision-making algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed, and the operation strategy of UAV group is optimized by Q-learning method, so that it can learn independently and make the best decision in complex environment. In the stage of task allocation and target cooperation, the task allocation method and consistency algorithm based on auction mechanism are adopted to realize efficient resource allocation and cooperative operation of UAV group and ensure the efficient completion of tasks. The experiment compares the rule-based decision-making algorithm, the traditional Q-learning algorithm and the method proposed in this paper by constructing typical combat scenarios such as static target attack, dynamic target tracking and complex electromagnetic environment. The results show that this method is superior to the traditional methods in task completion rate, response time, resource consumption rate and collaborative error, especially in dynamic and complex scenes.

Digital Twin Simulation (DTS) enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and strategic planning for effective disaster mitigation. Traditional disaster management approaches often suffer from delayed decision-making, lack of real-time data integration, and inefficient resource allocation. These limitations hinder swift response efforts, exacerbating the impact of disasters on affected communities. To address these challenges, we propose an AI-Driven Digital Twin Simulation (AI-DTS) framework for real-time disaster response and resource allocation. AI-DTS integrates artificial intelligence, digital twins, and the Metaverse to create a dynamic, data- driven environment for monitoring disasters, predicting their impact, and optimizing emergency response strategies. The framework utilizes AI-driven predictive analytics, IoT-enabled real-time data collection, and immersive simulations to enhance situational awareness. The proposed method allows crisis responders, policymakers, and emergency management teams to collaborate within an interactive digital space, ensuring efficient decision-making. AI-DTS enables rapid assessment of disaster scenarios, optimizes resource distribution, and provides simulated training environments to enhance preparedness. Experimental evaluations indicate that AI-DTS significantly improves response time, optimizes resource allocation by 30%, and enhances situational awareness by integrating real-time data into crisis response strategies. The findings demonstrate that the AI-DTS framework minimizes disaster impact, where the management of disaster was set to making the operational efficiency. © 2025 IEEE.","AI-Driven Disaster Management; Digital Twin Simulation; Metaverse; Real-Time Crisis Response","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Civil defense; Data integration; Decision making; Digital twin; Disaster prevention; Emergency services; Environmental management; Human resource management; Information management; Resource allocation; Risk management; Virtual reality; AI-driven disaster management; Crisis response; Decisions makings; Digital twin simulation; Disaster management; Metaverses; Real- time; Real-time crisis response; Real-time data; Resources allocation; Predictive analytics","","","","","","","Lyu, Zhihan, Impact of Digital Twins and Metaverse on Cities: History, Current Situation, and Application Perspectives, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 24, (2022); Progress in Electronics and Communication Engineering, (2025); Digital Communications and Networks, (2024); Sccts Journal of Embedded Systems Design and Applications, (2024); Coding Architecture Designing Toolkits, (2023); Santhosh, Jayagopalan, Image Driven Multi Feature Plant Management with FDE Based Smart Agriculture with Improved Security in Wireless Sensor Networks, Wireless Personal Communications, 127, 2, pp. 1647-1663, (2022); Unpublished; Uchida, Norihiko, Device-to-device communication based DTN for disaster information system by using emergent user policy and locational information, Journal of Internet Services and Information Security, 9, 3, pp. 41-51, (2019); Kulkarni, Chaitanya Shrikant, Hybrid disease prediction approach leveraging digital twin and metaverse technologies for health consumer, BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, 24, 1, (2024); Zhang, Jian, The AI-assisted Traditional Design Methods for the Construction Sustainability: A Case Study of the Lisu Ethnic Minority Village, Natural and Engineering Sciences, 9, 2, pp. 213-233, (2024)","M.

A comprehensive review of available services is conducted, highlighting their features, advantages, and limitations across various domains, including marketing, jurisprudence, medicine, and military applications. The study particularly focuses on the integration of data from messengers and public communication channels, given their increasing role in disseminating real-time information. The proposed approach combines traditional data collection services with alternative sources such as Telegram, Facebook, and YouTube, offering a more holistic and representative information environment. This integration facilitates the automated detection of patterns, trends, and anomalies, thereby enhancing decision-making processes in dynamic and data-intensive sectors. The results of experimental research confirm the viability of utilizing even unconventional information sources in analytical systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in detecting disinformation, forecasting potential threats, and automating routine analytical tasks. Furthermore, the paper introduces a conceptual model that integrates hyper-automation technologies with IIP to optimize data collection, preprocessing, and analysis. The model leverages robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven classification techniques to enhance efficiency and scalability. Experimental validation of the proposed model demonstrates its potential for real-world implementation, particularly in scenarios requiring rapid adaptation to evolving information landscapes. The findings underscore the significance of hyper-automated systems in addressing contemporary challenges in data intelligence.

Tactical tourniquets, early surgical haemostasis and massive transfusion protocols have all contributed to a significant decrease in war casualties' mortality. Large scale combat scenarios pose new and major challenges, as the volume of casualties is predicted to exceed available resources. Combat Medical Early Warning Systems (CMEWS) and wearable biosensors could present promising solutions in this context. An Early Warning System consists of three key components: data collection of vital signs, analysis through an Early Warning Score and a corresponding medical response. Biosensors, on the other hand, enable continuous monitoring of physiological parameters. Their miniaturisation, connectivity and reliability make them promising tools, though challenges such as accuracy, cost and data integration remain. Integrated CMEWS, combining biosensors with automated decision-making algorithms, could revolutionise the management of war casualties. These systems would assist in the early identification of severe war casualties and triage, assisting health services in casualty flow management. They have the potential for providing a shared, real-time overview of casualties' status for all healthcare providers. Additionally, the integration of these systems into the battlefield would facilitate improved coordination across medical and command structures, enhancing patient management even in remote or high-risk environments. However, the adoption of integrated CMEWS and biosensors faces challenges, including data security concerns, infrastructure limitations and the need for significant investment and training. Despite these hurdles, their potential to enhance casualty care, particularly in high-intensity conflict settings, is evident and could transform both military and civilian emergency medical care. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.","ACCIDENT & EMERGENCY MEDICINE; INTENSIVE & CRITICAL CARE; Military Personnel; TRAUMA MANAGEMENT; Trauma management; Wearable Electronic Devices","algorithm; army; battle injury; biosensor; controlled study; data integration; early warning score; emergency care; emergency medicine; health care personnel; human; information security; intensive care; investment; military medicine; military personnel; miniaturization; mortality; patient care; patient triage; reliability; review; surgical hemostasis; tourniquet; vital sign; warfare; wearable device; wearable electronic device","","","","","","","Smith, Gary B., The ability of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) to discriminate patients at risk of early cardiac arrest, unanticipated intensive care unit admission, and death, Resuscitation, 84, 4, pp. 465-470, (2013); Bartkowiak, Bartlomiej, Validating the Electronic Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage (eCART) Score for Risk Stratification of Surgical Inpatients in the Postoperative Setting: Retrospective Cohort Study, Annals of surgery, 269, 6, pp. 1059-1063, (2019); Arabi, Yaseen M., Electronic Sepsis Screening Among Patients Admitted to Hospital Wards: A Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial, JAMA, 333, 9, pp. 763-773, (2025); Escobar, Gabriel J., Automated identification of adults at risk for in-hospital clinical deterioration, New England Journal of Medicine, 383, 20, pp. 1951-1960, (2020); Moon, A., An eight year audit before and after the introduction of modified early warning score (MEWS) charts, of patients admitted to a tertiary referral intensive care unit after CPR, Resuscitation, 82, 2, pp. 150-154, (2011); Bellomo, Rinaldo, A controlled trial of electronic automated advisory vital signs monitoring in general hospital wards, Critical Care Medicine, 40, 8, pp. 2349-2361, (2012); Ludikhuize, Jeroen, Measuring adherence among nurses one year after training in applying the Modified Early Warning Score and Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation instruments, Resuscitation, 82, 11, pp. 1428-1433, (2011); Bedoya, Armando D., Minimal Impact of Implemented Early Warning Score and Best Practice Alert for Patient Deterioration, Critical Care Medicine, 47, 1, pp. 49-55, (2019); Heller, Axel R., Detection of Deteriorating Patients on Surgical Wards Outside the ICU by an Automated MEWS-Based Early Warning System with Paging Functionality, Annals of Surgery, 271, 1, pp. 100-105, (2020); McGaughey, Jennifer, Early warning systems and rapid response systems for the prevention of patient deterioration on acute adult hospital wards, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2021, 11, (2021)","Q.

A Fire Control Officer is responsible for assessing threats and assigning the most appropriate weapon to neutralize them. However, the decision-making process can be prone to errors, risking resource wastage and endangering DA protection. To address this problem, this research proposes a hybrid approach that combines a knowledge-driven fuzzy inference system with machine learning models to optimize resource allocation while incorporating expert knowledge in the decision-making process. Since sensory data obtained from multiple radars may be incomplete or incorrect, a fuzzy knowledge graph-based system is used for data fusion and providing it to the connected modules. Feature selection is optimized by including the most important parameters, such as the vitality of defended assets and threat score, in the threat evaluation. The results from these subsystems are visualized using a Geographical Information System, allowing for real-time mapping of the GBAD environment and displaying the results in a user-friendly web interface. The proposed system has undergone rigorous testing and evaluation, resulting in an efficient and accurate weapon assignment model with a low RMSE value of 0.037. Overall, this Intelligent Decision Support System provides an effective solution for optimizing decision-making processes in GBAD environments and can significantly improve DA protection. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Fuzzy Inference System (FIS); Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD); Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS); Knowledge Graphs (KG); Threat Evaluation Weapon Assignment (TEWA); Weapon Assignment (WA)","Antennas; Data fusion; Decision making; Decision support systems; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Network security; Fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy inference systems; Ground-based air defences; Ground-based air defense; Intelligent decision support system; Intelligent decision-support systems; Knowledge graph; Knowledge graphs; Threat evaluation; Threat evaluation weapon assignment; Weapon assignment; Weapons assignment; Graphic methods","","","","","","","Ahner, Darryl K., Optimal multi-stage allocation of weapons to targets using adaptive dynamic programming, Optimization Letters, 9, 8, pp. 1689-1701, (2014); Ahuja, R.

However, these systems face challenges ensuring security and resilience against adversarial attacks. This research addresses these challenges and introduces a novel Dampster–Shafer data fusion-based Adversarial Deep Learning (DS-ADL) Model for ITS in fog cloud environments. Our proposed model focuses on three levels of adversarial attacks: original image level, feature level, and decision level. Adversarial examples are generated at each level to evaluate the system's vulnerability comprehensively. To enhance the system's capabilities, we leverage the power of several vital components. Firstly, we employ Dempster–Shafer-based Multimodal Sensor Fusion, enabling the fusion of information from multiple sensors for improved scene understanding. This fusion approach enhances the system's perception and decision-making abilities. For feature extraction and classification, we utilize ResNet 101, a deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in computer vision tasks. We introduced a novel Monomodal Multidimensional Gaussian Model (MMGM-DD) based Adversarial Detection approach to detect adversarial examples. This detection mechanism enhances the system's ability to identify and mitigate adversarial attacks in real-time. Additionally, we incorporate the Defensive Distillation method for adversarial training, which trains the model to be robust against attacks by exposing it to adversarial examples during the training process. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we utilize two datasets: Google Speech Command version 0.01 and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). Evaluation metrics include latency delay and computation time (fog–cloud), accuracy, MSE, loss, and F-score for attack detection and defense. The results and discussions demonstrate the effectiveness of our Dampster–Shafer data fusion-based Adversarial Deep Learning Model in enhancing the robustness and security of ITS in fog–cloud environments. The model's ability to detect and defend against adversarial attacks while maintaining low-latency fog–cloud operations highlights its potential for real-world deployment in ITS. © 2023","Adversarial learning; Dampster–Shafer; Data fusion; Deep learning; Intelligent transportation system","Benchmarking; Data fusion; Decision making; Distillation; Feature extraction; Fog; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Learning systems; Speech recognition; Traffic signs; Advanced technology; Adversarial learning; Cloud environments; Dampster-Shafer; Deep learning; Fusion model; Intelligent transportation systems; Learning models; Safe mobility; Three-level","","","","","(42-830-1443); King Abdulaziz University, KAU; Ministry of Education, India, MoE","This research work was funded by Institutional Fund Projects under grant no.

As climate change increases the frequency and severity of floods, effective prediction and management strategies are urgently required. This report explores the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques for enhancing flood prediction and real-time data collection, while emphasizing the critical role of cybersecurity in protecting these systems. Accurate flood forecasting relies on vast datasets from high-resolution satellite imagery, IoT sensors, and advanced simulation models. However, these data sources and ML-driven systems are vulnerable to cyber threats such as data breaches, adversarial attacks, and sensor spoofing, which can compromise prediction accuracy and decision-making.

In safety-critical sectors, maintaining situational awareness is essential for performance and error prevention. Situational awareness (SAW) is crucial for the success of activities in many different domains, such as surveillance, humanitarian aid, and search and rescue efforts. SAW is however susceptible to enemy attacks. By giving users enhanced coverage, it increases survivability and mission capability. Recently, Smart gadgets used data to address crisis scenarios and provide real-time tracking to protect law enforcement personnel out in the field. Despite these developments, it might be challenging for first responders to get a precise feel of their surroundings due to an abundance of field data. Security teams need to be able to quickly transform this data into actionable intelligence using a few instruments at their disposal, including body cameras, fingerprint scanners, and facial recognition software. Officers can cut through the noise to acquire actual real-time situational awareness by integrating heterogeneous information into a cohesive platform. Therefore, the proposed work examines potential mitigation measures while considering hostile threats and assaults against SAW systems. Additionally, information and alarms can be instantly sent between operators and field officers using vital interface features. The optimization of the AutoML system is proposed for fusion of sensor data. AutoML classification with Bayesian and ASHA (Asynchronous successive halving algorithm) is used for situational forecasting and decision-making awareness, IoT is used to monitor data gathered from Kaggle and sensor readings, while thingspeak cloud is used to monitor sensor output. © 2023 IEEE.","AutoML; Cloud monitoring; IoT; Real-time tracking; Sensors; situation awareness; Thing speak","Face recognition; Internet of things; Safety engineering; Sensor data fusion; Automl; Cloud monitoring; Error prevention; First responders; IoT; Performance; Real time tracking; Situation awareness; Situational awareness; Thing speak; Decision making","","","","","","","Chong, Cheeyee, Architectures and algorithms for track association and fusion, IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, 15, 1, pp. 5-13, (2000); Multisensor Data Fusion, (1990); Luo, Ren Chyuan, Multisensor fusion and integration: Approaches, applications, and future research directions, IEEE Sensors Journal, 2, 2, pp. 107-119, (2002); Journal of Military Technology, (2025); Proc of the International Conference on Military Technology Washington, (2019); Journal of Military Strategy, (2022); Abdulhafiz, Waleed A., Bayesian approach to multisensor data fusion with Pre- and Post-Filtering, 2013 10th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control, ICNSC 2013, pp. 373-378, (2013); Gao, Junbin, Some remarks on Kalman filters for the multisensor fusion, Information Fusion, 3, 3, pp. 191-201, (2002); Sensor Fusion Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks, (2003); Ceruti, Marion G., Data management challenges and development for military information systems, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 15, 5, pp. 1059-1068, (2003)","R.

Recent advances in sensors, modeling and simulation and availability of open-source software and hardware for data integration has created an environment of remotely monitoring that was not possible a few years ago. This paper examines a niche cost-effective, portable Unmanned Surface Vessel that has been designed to capture the bathymetric profile of shallow water basins using single beam echosounder. Bathymetry is the measurement of the depth of water in oceans, rivers, or lakes. Bathymetric maps look a lot like topographic maps, which use lines to show the shape and elevation of land features. Today, echo sounders are used to make bathymetric measurements. Global shallow water bathymetry maps offer critical information to inform activities such as scientific research, environment protection, and marine transportation. Accurate mapping of shallow bathymetry is critical for understanding and characterizing coastal environments providing a foundation for measuring underwater light density, mapping and monitoring and planning marine operations and transportation. Methods for estimating shallow water bathymetry have suffered from a variety of trade-offs and limitations. Conventional methods such as shipborne sounding or airborne LiDAR have limited spatial coverage. The unit described in this paper has been designed and has been trained to acquire data in a predefined set path, minimizing the human intervention and the associated errors. A successful trial run was done for mapping the bed profile of the river basin in India. The vessel has been upskilled for capturing sonar data sets, with water quality parameters and soil samples using an automated auger. The vessel functions using the combined various open-source software and hardware tools for data assimilation, while the captured data sets are real- time transferred using IOT to Ground Controlled Station. The tropical river basin chosen is a part of Netravati River located in Dakshina Kannada District, Karnataka, India. This area is a part of the monsoon belt, and the Netravati riverbed is subjected to heavy sand deposition during a part of the year. The data on the excessive sand deposition is of immense value to the district and state administration. This study has been carried out at a frequency of 30 days and is provided as an input during non- monsoon period for district administration for outlining removal of excessive sand deposition monitoring of water quality in the estuarine ecosystem. The work done is a one-of-a-kind pilot study developed in-house using the recent advances seen in the world of open-source platforms. This paper demonstrates a unique application that is of value to the state administration in decision making and in addition contributes to environmental monitoring of the riverbed. © © 2022 by ASME.","Bathymetry; Echo-Sounder and Open Source; Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV)","Cost effectiveness; Data integration; Economic and social effects; Floods; Hydrographic surveys; Mapping; Maps; Military applications; Optical radar; Rivers; Underwater acoustics; Water quality; Watersheds; Echo sounders; Echo-sound and open source; Open-source; Open-source hardwares; Sand deposition; Shallow waters; Sound source; Unmanned surface vessel; Unmanned surface vessels; Water basins; Bathymetry","","","","","National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, NITK","We wish to acknowledge Department of Water Resources and Ocean Engineering and Centre for System Design, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal. for providing the support, resources to make this project possible.

The aerospace and defense sectors have a number of stochastic optimization problems that would benefit from the application of ML; however, people often have difficulties interpreting solutions arrived at via ML, which undermines trust, producing an obstacle to widespread adoption in these sectors. This paper introduces the Self-Explaining Decision Architecture (SEDA) for ML-based decision-making systems capable of generating intuitive explanations for their decisions in real time. SEDA makes use of a feature extraction subsystem and a sequence interpretation subsystem to identify patterns in data followed by a decision generation subsystem that determines appropriate actions based on those patterns. Internal state information from each of these subsystems is used to generate explanations of the system's decisions. Using this information to create explanations provides insight as to the data elements the system focused on when making decisions as well as the reasoning that was used. As a proof-of-concept, we present a first implementation of SEDA using start-of-the-art deep learning components including a combined convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network with attention mechanisms and demonstrate its use on both standard and custom datasets. © 2021 IEEE.","Automated Routing; Data Fusion; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Self-Explaining AI; System Architecture","Behavioral research; Command and control systems; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Deep learning; Network architecture; Optimization; Real time systems; Stochastic systems; Aerospace sectors; Automated routing; Command and control; Defense sectors; Machine-learning; Routings; Self-explaining AI; Stochastic optimization problems; Systems architecture; Data fusion","","","","","","","Han, Houzeng, An emergency seamless positioning technique based on ad hoc UWB networking using robust EKF, Sensors (Switzerland), 19, 14, (2019); Zhang, Zhiyu, Adaptive extended Kalman filter with correntropy loss for robust power system state estimation, Entropy, 21, 3, (2019); Eichstadt, Sascha, On the evaluation of uncertainties for state estimation with the Kalman filter, Measurement Science and Technology, 27, 12, (2016); Zhou, Siyu, A deep q-network (DQN) based path planning method for mobile robots, 2018 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation, ICIA 2018, pp. 366-371, (2018); Li, Yibing, A UAV Path Planning Method Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, 2020 USNC-URSI Radio Science Meeting (Joint with AP-S Symposium), USNC/URSI 2020 - Proceedings, pp. 93-94, (2020); Cacchiani, Valentina, Heuristic approaches for flight retiming in an integrated airline scheduling problem of a regional carrier, Omega (United Kingdom), 91, (2020); Ben Ahmed, Mohamed, A two-level optimization approach for robust aircraft routing and retiming, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 112, pp. 586-594, (2017); Chen, Chiuhung, Multiobjective Evolutionary Scheduling and Rescheduling of Integrated Aircraft Routing and Crew Pairing Problems, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 35018-35030, (2020); Assaad, Zena, Considerations for Assuring Software Systems of Autonomous Aircraft, 2020 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2020, pp. 3018-3024, (2020); Adebayo, Julius, Sanity checks for saliency maps, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2018-December, pp. 9505-9515, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","AESS; AIAA; AIAA Digital Avionics Technical Committee (DATC); et al.; IEEE; Southwest Research Institute (SWRI)","40th IEEE/AIAA Digital Avionics Systems Conference, DASC 2021","2021-10-03 through 2021-10-07","San Antonio","174202","21557195","1424411084; 9781479950010; 9781424403783; 9781538641125; 9781424440788; 9781665486071; 9781424466160; 9781467316996; 9781665434201; 9781728106496","ADACF","","English","AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122829480"

The significance and scope of urban surveillance has increased manyfold in recent years due to the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Internet of things (IoTs), and multitude of sensors. In this article, we propose FogSurv - a fog-assisted surveillance architecture and framework leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and information/data fusion for enabling real-time SA and monitoring. We also propose an AI- and data-driven information fusion model for FogSurv to help provide (near) real-time SA, threat assessment, and automated decision-making. We further present a latency model for AI and information fusion processing in FogSurv. We then discuss several use cases of FogSurv that can have a huge impact on multifarious fronts of national significance ranging from safeguarding national security to monitoring of critical infrastructures. We conduct an extensive set of experiments to demonstrate that FogSurv using AI and data fusion help provide near real-time inferences and SA. Experimental results demonstrate that FogSurv provides a latency improvement of 37% on average over cloud architectures for the selected benchmarks. Results further indicate that combining AI with data fusion as in FogSurv can provide a speedup of up to 9.8 × over AI without data fusion while also maintaining or improving the inference accuracy. Additionally, results show that AI combined with fusion of different image modalities obtained through UAVs in FogSurv results in improved average precision of target detection for surveillance as compared to AI without data fusion for different target scales and environment complexity. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; deep neural networks; fog computing; information fusion; situational awareness; unmanned aerial vehicles; Urban surveillance","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Architecture; Decision making; Fog; Fog computing; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Information fusion; Monitoring; National security; Network architecture; Sensor data fusion; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Data driven; Information data; Near-real time; Real- time; Situational awareness; Situational monitoring; Surveillance architecture; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Urban surveillance; Deep neural networks","","","","","Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA8750-15-3-6003, FA9550-15-0001, FA9550-20-F-0005); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL","This work was supported in part by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Information Directorate (RI) through the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program©R under Contract FA8750-15-3-6003, Contract FA9550-15-0001, and Contract FA9550-20-F-0005.","Las Vegas Shooting, (2017); List of Us Mass Shootings, (2018); Carminati, Marco, Prospects of Distributed Wireless Sensor Networks for Urban Environmental Monitoring, IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, 34, 6, pp. 44-52, (2019); Hossein Motlagh, Naser Hossein, UAV-Based IoT Platform: A Crowd Surveillance Use Case, IEEE Communications Magazine, 55, 2, pp. 128-134, (2017); Chen, Ning, Dynamic urban surveillance video stream processing using fog computing, Proceedings - 2016 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Multimedia Big Data, BigMM 2016, pp. 105-112, (2016); Wang, Jianyu, Elastic urban video surveillance system using edge computing, SmartIoT 2017 - Proceedings of the Workshop on Smart Internet of Things, (2017); Pavlidis, I., Surveillance systems: From the laboratory to the commercial world, Proceedings of the IEEE, 89, 10, pp. 1478-1496, (2001); Hu, Ling, IoT-Driven Automated Object Detection Algorithm for Urban Surveillance Systems in Smart Cities, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5, 2, pp. 747-754, (2018); Liu, Gaocheng, Object Tracking in Vary Lighting Conditions for Fog Based Intelligent Surveillance of Public Spaces, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 29283-29296, (2018); Liu, Bingwei, Information fusion in a cloud computing era: A systems-level perspective, IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, 29, 10, pp. 16-24, (2014)","A.

In part, this is due to the high volume of incoming data that are available to the operational community. However, better exploitation of these data streams can be accomplished through techniques that focus on the semantics of the incoming stream, to discover information-based alerts that generate knowledge that is only obtainable when considering the totality of the streams. In this paper, we present an agile data architecture for real-time data representation, integration, and querying situations over heterogeneous data streams using Semantic Web Technologies, with the goal of improved knowledge interoperability. We apply the framework to the maritime ship traffic domain to discover real-time traffic alerts by querying and reasoning across multiple streams. © 2019 IEEE.","","Data integration; Decision making; Information systems; Information use; Military communications; Semantic Web; Waterway transportation; Data architectures; Decision making process; Heterogeneous data; Maritime environment; Operational community; Real time traffics; Semantic web standards; Semantic Web technology; Data communication systems","","","","","","Funding text 1: This work is part of the MIMIR (Mission-relevant Information Management for Integrated Response) project, which seeks to develop ideas and techniques for seamless integration of data streams of the many IoT sensors infrastructure.

Command by intent is a paradigm that empowers subordinate units to exercise measured initiative to meet mission goals and accept prudent risk within commander's intent. It improves agility of military operations by allowing exploitation of local opportunities without an explicit directive from the commander to do so. This paper discusses what the paradigm entails in terms of architectural decisions for data fusion systems tasked with real-time information collection to satisfy operational mission goals. In our system, information needs of decisions are expressed at a high level, and shared among relevant nodes. The selected nodes, then, jointly operate to meet mission information needs by forwarding and caching relevant data without explicit directives regarding the objects to fetch and sources to contact. A preliminary evaluation of the system is presented using a target tracking application, set in the context of a NATO-based mission scenario, called Anglova. Evaluation results show that delegating some decision authority to the data fusion system (in terms of objects to fetch and sources to contact) allows it to save more network resources, while also increasing mission success rate. The system is therefore particularly well-suited to operation in partially denied or contested environments, where resource bottlenecks caused by adversarial activity impair one's ability to collect real-time information for mission-critical decision making. © 2018 ISIF","Command-by-intent; Decision-centric; IoBT","Data fusion; Decision making; Information fusion; Military operations; Risk assessment; Software architecture; Target tracking; Architectural decision; Battlefield information; Command-by-intent; Decision-centric; IoBT; Mission-critical decisions; Real-time information; Real-time information collections; Real time systems","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS 13-20209, CNS 16-18627); National Science Foundation, NSF; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (W911NF-17-C-0099); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Army Research Laboratory, ARL, (W911NF-09-2-0053, W911NF-17-2-0196); Army Research Laboratory, ARL","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Research reported in this paper was sponsored in part by the Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreements W911NF-09-2-0053 and W911NF-17-2-0196, in part by DARPA under award W911NF-17-C-0099, and in part by NSF under grants CNS 16-18627 and CNS 13-20209.

To solve the hidden terminal problem, collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS), which benifits from spatial diversity, has been studied intensively in CR networks. For current CSS schemes, secondary users (SUs) are generally assumed to send sensing information honestly, however, misbehaved SUs may report false sensing data to mislead and compromise the system, which is called spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks. In order to defense against malicious SSDF attacks, certain evidence-theory-based secure sensing approaches have been proposed. However, in most of the current evidence-theory-based CSS schemes, only real-time evidence information is utilized to estimate the sensing reliability of cognitive users, like the difference in SNR or similarity degree. Inadequate consideration causes CSS system being vulnerable to SSDF attacks, and the correctness of global decision making cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a credible CSS scheme based on evidence theory. It evaluates the credibility of each SU with two indexes, which are the statistical reputation factor and the real-time reliability factor, respectively. In addition, considering the transmitted data rises with the number of SUs increasing, we propose a rational mass distribution (RMD) approach to adjust evidence theory to binary hypothesis test in spectrum sensing context. As a consequence, both the data volume to be transmitted and the workload at data fusion center has been reduced. Simulation results have proved that the proposed scheme is effective and robust to defense against distinctive SSDF attack patterns. © 2018 Electromagnetics Academy.

To capture the numerous and varied decision-making requirements involved in such evacuation management, the integration of multi-model and data resources is urgently needed. This paper proposes a framework for such an integrated emergency evacuation management system. Its purpose aims to make multiple models run in concert in order to model a large-scale traffic evacuation emergency management process for an entire lifecycle. Ontological representation is employed as the underlying approach to support the knowledge integration of urgent scenarios, response tasks, models, and data in a systematic manner. With the help of semantic ontologies, the system can automatically search and combine associated models and data. © 2015 ACM.","Large-scale traffic evacuation; Multi-model integration; Ontology","Civil defense; Data integration; Decision making; Disasters; Emergency traffic control; Integration; Ontology; Risk management; Search engines; Semantics; Emergency evacuation; Evacuation management; Evacuation simulation; Knowledge integration; Large-scale traffic evacuation; Multi-model integration; Ontological representation; Real-time identification; Information management","","","","","(2015BAK12B01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (70601015, 70833003, 91024032, 91224008, 91324022); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was partially funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 91324022, No. 91224008, No. 91024032, No. 70601015, No. 70833003) and the Project of National Key Technologies RandD Program of China (No. 2015BAK12B01).","Alizadeh, Rahim, A dynamic cellular automaton model for evacuation process with obstacles, Safety Science, 49, 2, pp. 315-323, (2011); Chari, Kaushal, Model composition in a distributed environment, Decision Support Systems, 35, 3, pp. 399-413, (2003); Chechik, Marsha, A relationship-based approach to model integration, Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering, 8, 1, pp. 3-18, (2012); Hess, Daniel Baldwin, Multi-modal mass evacuation in upstate New York: A review of disaster plans, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, 4, 3, (2007); Iyer, Bala R., Model management decision environment: A Web service prototype for spreadsheet models, Decision Support Systems, 40, 2, pp. 283-304, (2005); Li, Anna C.Y., Shelter location and transportation planning under hurricane conditions, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 48, 4, pp. 715-729, (2012); 10th International Conference on Cybernetics and Information Technologies Systems and Applications, (2013); Madhusudan, Therani, A declarative approach to composing web services in dynamic environments, Decision Support Systems, 41, 2, pp. 325-357, (2006); An Operational Research Based Integrated Approach for Mass Evacuation Planning of A City, (2014); Nagarajan, Magesh, Disseminating a warning message to evacuate: A simulation study of the behaviour of neighbours, European Journal of Operational Research, 220, 3, pp. 810-819, (2012)","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc acmhelp@acm.org","","1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on the Use of GIS in Emergency Management, EM-GIS 2015","2015-11-03","Seattle","122414","","9781595930361","","","English","Proc.

This information needs to be coordinated in order to make decisions at all levels of the emergency management. This paper focuses on a foundation for efficient management of the emergency. Efficient management of the emergency is obstructed with many factors such as information unavailability for decision making and for situational awareness, stress, information overload, unstructured data from different sources, and data in different formats. So, to avoid the factors which cause obstruction for efficient emergency management, data from different databases has to be integrated in a semantic way. The research challenge addressed in this paper is to formulate a reference architecture for data integration to optimize the operations of emergency management. The paper establishes the need for IT reference architecture for efficient operations of emergency management based on real time data integration.","Data integration; Emergency management; Information provision and decision making; IT reference architecture","Architecture; Civil defense; Data integration; Decision making; Disasters; Information science; Information systems; Risk management; Semantics; Effective management; Efficient managements; Emergency management; Emergency responders; Information overloads; Information provision; Reference architecture; Situational awareness; Information management","","","","","","","Guide to Emergency Management and Related Terms Definitions Concepts Acronyms Organizations Programs Guidance Executive Orders Legislation, (2008); Big Data Metadata Management in Smart Grids Big Data and Internet of Things A Roadmap for Smart Environments, (2014); Hristidis, Vagelis, Survey of data management and analysis in disaster situations, Journal of Systems and Software, 83, 10, pp. 1701-1714, (2010); Proceeding of the 24rth International Congress on Condition Monitoring and Diagnostics Engineering Management, (2011); Tanasescu, Vlad, A semantic web services GIS based emergency management application, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 4273 LNCS, pp. 959-966, (2006); Emrich, Christopher T., GIS and emergency management, The SAGE Handbook of GIS and Society, pp. 321-344, (2011); Nguyen, Trinh Hoang, A framework for data integration of offshore wind farms, Renewable Energy, 60, pp. 150-161, (2013); 24th Conference on Information Technology in Construction, (2007); Review of Emergency Management Information Standards, (2008)","","Powell, P.; Nunes, M.B.; Isaias, P.; Rodrigues, L.","IADIS secretariat@iadis.org","Turismo de Portugal - Madeira Islands","8th IADIS International Conference on Information Systems, IS 2015","2015-03-14 through 2015-03-16","Madeira","114450","","9789898533333","","","English","Proc.

As the incident progresses, the ability to predict where additional resources will be needed is crucial to both response and recovery. Decision making and prediction in this context requires combining (fusing) incoming data streams; presenting relevant information from these streams in a form appropriate for each user; and using data from similar historical events to predict resource needs and incident evolution. This paper discusses the role of data fusion, data integration, and data mining in decision making for municipal or regional emergency managers. It also explores the implementation of web-based decision support tools. Finally, the paper makes recommendations for improving information management and streamlining decision support. © 2013 IEEE.","critical infrastructure protection; data fusion; data mining; decision support; emergency operations","Critical infrastructure protection; Data stream; Decision support tools; Decision supports; Emergency operations; Incomplete information; Multiple data sources; Time-critical; Critical infrastructures; Data fusion; Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Information management; Managers; National security; Public works; Security systems; Data mining","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1303269)","","New York Post, (2012); Fusion Center Guidelines Developing and Sharing Information and Intelligence in A New Era, (2006); Considerations for Fusion Center and Emergency Operations Center Coordination, (2010); Esteban, Jaime, A review of data fusion models and architectures: Towards engineering guidelines, Neural Computing and Applications, 14, 4, pp. 273-281, (2005); Data Fusion Lexicon, (1991); Thomopoulos, Stelios C.A., Sensor integration and data fusion, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 1198, pp. 178-191, (1990); PAU, L.

In medicine, however, oncology recapitulates polemology, the science of warfare: The medical establishment is transitioning from highly toxic poisons that kill rapidly dividing normal and malignant cells with little specificity to tailored therapies that target the tumors with the lethality of the therapeutic warhead. From the advent of the information age with the incorporation of high-tech intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance has resulted in ""data fusion"" where a wide range of information collected in near real-time can be used to redesign most of the treatment strategies currently used in the clinic. The medical community has begun to transition from the 'black box' of tumor therapy based solely on the clinical response to the 'glass box' of dynamic imaging designed to bring transparency to the clinical battlefield during treatment, thereby informing the therapeutic decision to 'retreat or repeat'. The tumor microenvironment is dynamic, constantly changing in response to therapeutic intervention, and therefore the therapeutic assessment must map to this variable and ever-changing landscape with dynamic and non-static imaging capabilities. The path to personalized medicine will require incorporation and integration of dynamic imaging at the bedside into clinical practice for real-time, interactive assessment of response to targeted therapies. The application of advanced real time imaging techniques along with current molecularly targeted anticancer therapies which alter cellular homeostasis and microenvironment can enhance therapeutic interventions in cancer patients and further improve the current status in clinical management of patients with advanced cancers. © Ivyspring International Publisher.","Cancer; Cancer therapy; Drug delivery; Imaging; MicroRNA","1 fluoro 3 (2 nitro 1 imidazolyl) 2 propanol f 18; 3' fluorothymidine; [2 (2 nitro 1[h] imidazol 1 yl) n (2,2,3,3,3 pentafluoropropyl)acetamide]; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; axitinib; carbon monoxide; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; fluorouracil; folinic acid; irinotecan; microRNA; oxaliplatin; rrx 001; toxic substance; tracer; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; water; advanced cancer; antioxidant activity; biotechnology; cancer cell; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer epidemiology; cancer staging; cancer therapy; cell division; cell killing; cell specificity; clinical decision making; clinical practice; clinical protocol; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhanced ultrasound; contrast enhancement; data analysis; detoxification; drug delivery system; drug treatment failure; dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; elastography; health care facility; homeostasis; human; information processing; kidney carcinoma; lethality; malignant neoplastic disease; medical society; metastatic colorectal cancer; molecular biology; molecularly targeted therapy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oncological parameters; oncology; pancreas cancer; patient care; personalized medicine; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); phylogeny; positron emission tomography; radiography; real time dynamic imaging; review; target cell; treatment outcome; tumor microenvironment; ultrasound; Cancer; drug delivery.; imaging; Humans; Individualized Medicine; MicroRNAs; Molecular Imaging; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasms","","3' fluorothymidine, 25526-93-6; axitinib, 319460-85-0; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18, 63503-12-8; fluorouracil, 51-21-8; folinic acid, 58-05-9; irinotecan, 100286-90-6; oxaliplatin, 61825-94-3; water, 7732-18-5; MicroRNAs, 0","","","","","Ilivitzki, Anat, Early interim FDG PET/CT prediction of treatment response and prognosis in pediatric Hodgkin disease - Added value of low-dose CT, Pediatric Radiology, 43, 1, pp. 86-92, (2013); Ding, Xiuping, Feasibility of shrinking field radiation therapy through 18F-FDG PET/CT after 40 Gy for stage III non-small cell lung cancers, Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, 13, 1, pp. 319-323, (2012); Bartsevich, Victor V., Regulation of the MDR1 gene by transcription repressors selected using peptide combinatorial libraries, Molecular Pharmacology, 58, 1, pp. 1-10, (2000); Marthinet, Eric, Modulation of the typical multidrug resistance phenotype by targeting the MED-1 region of human MDR1 promoter, Gene Therapy, 7, 14, pp. 1224-1233, (2000); Tiberghien, Françoise, Aureobasidins: Structure-activity relationships for the inhibition of the human MDR1 P-glycoprotein ABC-transporter, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 43, 13, pp. 2547-2556, (2000); Ladas, Elena J., Antioxidants and cancer therapy: A systematic review, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 22, 3, pp. 517-528, (2004); Oronsky, Bryan T., The scarlet letter of alkylation: A mini review of selective alkylating agents, Translational Oncology, 5, 4, pp. 226-229, (2012); Ning, Shoucheng, Dinitroazetidines are a novel class of anticancer agents and hypoxia-activated radiation sensitizers developed from highly energetic materials, Cancer Research, 72, 10, pp. 2600-2608, (2012); Scicinski, Jan J., Preclinical evaluation of the metabolism and disposition of RRx-001, a novel investigative anticancer agent, Drug Metabolism and Disposition, 40, 9, pp. 1810-1816, (2012); Taneja, Samir S., Re: Comparative effectiveness of axitinib versus sorafenib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (AXIS): A randomised phase 3 trial, Journal of Urology, 188, 2, pp. 412-413, (2012)","R.
