Nevertheless, the pivotal clutter-suppression component employing Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) has long been plagued by performance degradation due to training sample scarcity in heterogeneous terrain environments. In this article, aimed at addressing this challenge and further extending the WAS-GMTI technique by integrating state-of-the-art Sparse Recovery (SR) theory, we propose a general Sparse-based WAS-GMTI (S-WAS-GMTI) framework for multichannel airborne radar applications. The framework was originally developed using a tensor representation to ensure both computational efficiency and scalability to high-dimensional echo data processing. Next, to face real-time deployment requirements, two Reduced-Dimensional (RD) versions S-WAS-GMTI framework are systematically designed to optimize computational efficiency. Simultaneously, given the high computational cost associated with SR optimization, we also propose Fourier-based overcomplete dictionary construction methods and a fast Fourier Transform-based tensor Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) method, resulting in several orders of magnitude improvement in solving efficiency compared to traditional SBL SR methods. More significantly, diverging from our prior work, we employ our recently developed advanced multi-channel airborne radar system to experimentally validate the proposed S-WAS-GMTI. Extensive real-measured datasets conclusively demonstrate the superior performance of S-WAS-GMTI relative to the existing WAS-GMTI processing. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","Airborne radar; sparse recovery space-time adaptive processing (SR-STAP); subarray; wide-area surveillance ground moving target indication (WAS-GMTI)","Aircraft radar equipment; Computation theory; Echo suppression; Learning systems; Radar measurement; Radar signal processing; Radar target recognition; Radar theory; Space time adaptive processing; Space-based radar; Tensors; Airborne radar systems; Ground moving target indication; Multi channel; Space-time adaptive processing; Sparse bayesian; Sparse recovery; Sparse recovery space-time adaptive processing; Subarray; Wide area surveillance; Wide-area surveillance ground moving target indication; Computational efficiency","","","","","","This work was supported in part by the XXXX.

The proposed integration of polarization modulation with push-broom scanning reduces the system volume by approximately 70% and achieves a total weight of around 1.5 kg, compared with traditional technology. The developed Fourier transform-based demodulation algorithm achieves accurate reconstruction of polarimetric spectral image information, with a linear polarization measurement error of less than 2.87% verified by experiments. What are the implications of the main findings? Retrieval of Earth’s atmospheric composition and optical parameters The identification of sensitive bands reduces the number of redundant experiments and guides polarization-based material discrimination. Polarimetric spectral imaging systems have unique application advantages in environmental remote sensing, military target recognition, astronomy, medicine, etc., because of their ability to acquire multidimensional information. However, traditional systems are constrained by complex structures and low spectral resolution, making them unlikely to achieve their full potential. This study proposes a novel polarimetric spectral imaging method for information acquisition to address these shortcomings. The method integrates a polarization modulator (composed of two retarders and one polarizer) into the incident optical path of a push-broom imaging spectrometer for hardware integration. The modulator statically encodes the full polarization spectral information of the measured light into output power spectra, which the spectrometer records as raw spectral image data. Target polarimetric spectral imaging information is then reconstructed from the raw data to realize sensor functions. The system structure, data reconstruction principles, laboratory experiments with typical polarized light sources, and preliminary outdoor experiments verified the system’s correctness and reliability. The results facilitate further expansion of the application scope of polarimetric spectral imaging systems. © 2025 by the authors.","data reconstruction; outdoor experiments; polarimetric spectral imaging; polarization modulator; push-broom imaging spectrometer","Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Mathematical transformations; Optical data processing; Optical sensors; Optical signal processing; Optical variables measurement; Polarimeters; Polarization; Polarographic analysis; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Data reconstruction; Imaging sensors; Imaging spectrometers; Outdoor experiment; Polarimetric spectral imaging; Polarization modulators; Push-broom imaging spectrometer; Spectral imaging; Spectral imaging system; Spectral polarization; Spectrometers; article; drug analysis; human; human cell; imaging system; nonhuman; pharmaceutics; pharmacology; polarization; reliability; remote sensing; sensor; spectral imaging; spectrometer","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKPs; Anhui University, (K110432069); Anhui University","This research was funded by Anhui University (grant number: K110432069) and the 2021 National Key Research and Development Program.

Global Health Engagements are intended to both help partner nations achieve the capacity, capability, and interoperability necessary to provide care to their own and also delivering an appropriate standard of care to U.S. service members, when needed. As standards and capabilities vary globally, planning GHEs is increasingly data-driven, relying on sources focused on GHE information requirements as well as those focused on GHE-supportive information needs. Current challenges to the use of GHE data in planning and crisis management are its lack of availability, standardization, integration, and visualization. Solving these challenges requires improved data curation, analysis, and user interface design to properly optimize engagements and care delivery. Materials and Methods Our research focused on supporting the Center for Global Health Engagement’s (CGHE) ability to effectively plan, execute, and track a range of these engagements across the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. We leveraged Machine Learning (ML) capabilities including Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist users in making sense of large and disparate datasets. Our solution focused on automating the ingestion of data from unstructured text (GHE surveys), establishing a unified and standardized data format, developing interactive analytic tools, and presenting the results through user-specific visualizations to support decision-making and risk-informed course of action recommendations. Results To curate, analyze, and visualize GHE data, we developed a prototype ML algorithm that employs an LLM for global health tactical-level hospital data ingestion, curation aggregation, and analysis and displays results for patient distribution in response to a crisis scenario using a 3D geospatial mapping visualization tool. The resulting capability uses an advanced, adaptive User Interface to visualize outputs from the ML algorithm, including providing explanations in a human-readable format on how the algorithm arrived at these outputs. Conclusion The results provide practical applications for proof of concept of AI assistance in supporting global health data processing and analysis, with applications extending to the biosurveillance, medical countermeasures, and medical logistics domains. This study has direct implications for understanding partner healthcare capabilities and integrating them into military healthcare plans to support military and medical decision-making for operational planning, crisis management and conflict healthcare delivery and the planning and execution of future health engagements. © The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2025.

Flex power is able to adjust the GPS signal power for better anti-interference performance. It has been shown that flex power causes changes in satellite Differential Code Bias (DCB). Therefore, we use a flex power detection method and a filter-based DCB estimation method. Based on the Multi-Global Navigation Satellite System Experiment (MGEX) data in 2023, we analyzed in detail the flex power status of GPS satellites and its impact on satellite DCB. The experimental results show that in 2023, the main enhancement areas of the GPS satellite flexible power supply are from 31°W to 153°E and from 57°N to 57°S. The military codes of L1 and L2 are enhanced while the civilian codes are kept unchanged. For example, for G10, flex power enhancement is enabled for approximately 12 h per day from Day of Year (DOY) 002 to DOY 006 in 2023, and flex power enhancement is enabled all day from DOY 115 to DOY 117 in 2023. On average, power enhancements are enabled 53.98% of the time in a year. As for the effects of flex power on DCB variations, both C1C-C1W and C2C-C2W DCB changed significantly during flex power, with the G10 satellite DCB changing from 0.5 to 1.3 ns and from 1.1 to 1.6 ns. Besides, it can be noticed that while flex power is enabled or disabled in a very short period of time, DCB will take serval hours to become stable. Therefore, we propose to use the filtering method to estimate the satellite DCB and adjust the filtering parameter process noise based on the flex power real-time detection to improve the DCB estimation accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Differential code bias; Flex power; GPS; High temporal resolution; Pseudo-range bias","Forward error correction; IIR filters; Image thinning; Military data processing; Military satellites; Differential code bias; Flex power; Global positioning; High temporal resolution; Is-enabled; Positioning system; Power; Pseudo-range bias; Pseudorange; Range bias; Global positioning system; detection method; GPS; image resolution; modernization; remote sensing; satellite data; signal-to-noise ratio","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42274023); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Academy of Space Technology, CAST, (YESS20210184); China Academy of Space Technology, CAST","This research is financially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42274023) and Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (No. YESS20210184).","Factorization Methods for Discrete Sequential Estimation, (1977); Deng, Yuanfan, Estimation and analysis of the multi-frequency and multi-channel DCB for BDS-3, Cehui Xuebao/Acta Geodaetica et Cartographica Sinica, 50, 4, pp. 448-456, (2021); Esenbuğa, Özge Gizem, Recent flex power changes, GPS Solutions, 27, 3, (2023); Gong, Xiaopeng, Evaluation and calibration of BeiDou receiver-related pseudorange biases, GPS Solutions, 22, 4, (2018); Gong, Xiaopeng, Improving GPS and Galileo precise data processing based on calibration of signal distortion biases, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 174, (2021); Gong, Xiaopeng, The long-term characteristics of GNSS signal distortion biases and their empirical corrections, GPS Solutions, 26, 2, (2022); Gu, Shengfeng, BDS-3 differential code bias estimation with undifferenced uncombined model based on triple-frequency observation, Journal of Geodesy, 94, 4, (2020); Interface Specification is GPS 200 Navstar GPS Space Segment Navigation User Segment Interfaces, (2018); Jiménez-Baños, David, The measured effects of GPS flex power capability collected on sensor station data, Programme and Abstract Book - 5th ESA Workshop on Satellite Navigation Technologies and European Workshop on GNSS Signals and Signal Processing, NAVITEC 2010, (2010); Li, Zishen, Two-step method for the determination of the differential code biases of COMPASS satellites, Journal of Geodesy, 86, 11, pp. 1059-1076, (2012)","Y.

Early outbreak detection and response remain hampered by fragmented surveillance systems, which often lack interoperability and limit data accessibility. Materials and Methods To address the major limitations of current measles surveillance systems - including data fragmentation and lack of standardization - we developed Measles Tracker, an integrated near-real-time data hub that centralizes and harmonizes measles surveillance data in the United States using publicly available sources. The system aggregates data from multiple layers, including: (1) official reports from public health agencies, (2) epidemiological surveillance bulletins, and (3) outbreak reports, mainly captured through news websites or via news aggregators. The platform architecture implements (1) geospatial normalization of key epidemiological variables (case counts, vaccination coverage, age-stratified incidence) and (2) dynamic visualization interfaces to support coordination of evidence-based response. Results Measles Tracker enhances situational awareness by integrating disparate data streams in near real-time, enabling rapid geospatial detection of outbreak clusters, mapping vaccination gaps, and supporting dynamic risk stratification of vulnerable populations. It is intended exclusively as a complementary tool to official public health systems, providing educational and situational awareness without interfering with contact tracing, vaccination, or outbreak control activities. Conclusions As a centralized, scalable tool, Measles Tracker advances measles surveillance by leveraging digital epidemiology principles. Future iterations will incorporate additional data streams (eg, climate variables, genomic surveillance) and advanced analytics (eg, machine learning for risk prediction, network models for transmission dynamics) to further optimize outbreak preparedness and resource allocation. This framework underscores the transformative potential of integrated data systems in global measles elimination efforts. © 2025 The Author(s).","infectious disease tracking; measles; public health data; real-time monitoring; surveillance","measles vaccine; Article; awareness; biogeography; child; clinical dashboard; contact examination; data aggregation; data processing; digitization; epidemic; epidemiological monitoring; evidence based practice; geographic distribution; geographic mapping; health data; human; incidence; interactive dashboard; Internet; kindergarten; machine learning; major clinical study; mass medium; measles; measles vaccination; people by vaccination status; public health; resource allocation; trend study; United States; vaccination coverage; vaccine hesitancy; vulnerable population","","","","","","","Kozlakidis, Zisis, Global health and data-driven policies for emergency responses to infectious disease outbreaks, The Lancet Global Health, 8, 11, pp. e1361-e1363, (2020); Badker, Rinette, Challenges in reported COVID-19 data: Best practices and recommendations for future epidemics, BMJ Global Health, 6, 5, (2021); Wang, Guannan, Comparing and integrating US COVID-19 data from multiple sources with anomaly detection and repairing, Journal of Applied Statistics, 50, 11-12, pp. 2408-2434, (2023); Patel, Minal K., Progress toward regional measles elimination - Worldwide, 2000-2019, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 69, 45, pp. 1700-1705, (2020); Guerra, Fiona M., The basic reproduction number (R0) of measles: a systematic review, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 17, 12, pp. e420-e428, (2017); Hinman, Alan R., Elimination of indigenous measles from the United States, Reviews of Infectious Diseases, 5, 3, pp. 538-545, (1983); Birkhead, Guthrie S., New York State's two-dose schedule for measles immunization, Public Health Reports, 106, 3, pp. 338-344, (1991); Thomas, Ann R., Timing and effectiveness of requirements for a second dose of measles vaccine, Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, 18, 3, pp. 266-270, (1999); Hinman, Alan R., Evolution of measles elimination strategies in the United States, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 189, SUPPL. 1, pp. S17-S22, (2004); Phadke, Varun K., Association between vaccine refusal and vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States A review of measles and pertussis, JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association, 315, 11, pp. 1149-1158, (2016)","M.M.

It is a dynamic and complex fluid system that not only sustains life but also serves as the medium through which many modern technologies operate. The atmosphere is responsible for weather patterns, climate regulation, and the distribution of natural resources, all of which are vital for human survival and societal progress. Remote sensing, optical communication, astronomical observation, and high-energy laser applications all rely on atmospheric transmission properties. Understanding and predicting atmospheric conditions is therefore essential for both scientific advancement and practical applications in fields ranging from meteorology to national defense. Moreover, the atmosphere influences global ecosystems and biodiversity, affecting agriculture, water resources, and energy production. As such, comprehensive research into the atmospheric environment is imperative for addressing contemporary challenges such as climate change, resource management, and environmental sustainability. Atmospheric optical turbulence, characterized by small-scale fluctuations in the refractive index of air, represents one of the most significant challenges in atmospheric optics. These fluctuations are primarily caused by temperature variations and air mixing processes, creating dynamic disturbances that affect light propagation through the atmosphere. The consequences include wavefront distortion, beam wandering, intensity scintillation, and degradation of spatial coherence. These phenomena directly limit the performance of high-energy laser systems, compromise the stability of free-space optical communication links, and reduce the resolving power of ground-based astronomical telescopes. The refractive index structure parameter C2<inf>n</inf> has become the standard metric for quantifying optical turbulence intensity, making its accurate measurement and prediction critical for optical system design and operation. Detection and prediction of atmospheric optical turbulence profiles have garnered significant attention due to their practical importance. For high-energy laser applications, knowledge of turbulence distribution enables adaptive optics systems to compensate for wavefront distortions, dramatically improving beam quality and effective range. In astronomical observations, understanding turbulence profiles allows for site selection optimization and implementation of multi-conjugate adaptive optics. For free-space optical communications, especially in satellite-to-ground links, turbulence profile information facilitates link budget calculations and helps optimize system parameters to maintain communication reliability. The military significance is equally profound, as turbulence directly impacts target acquisition, tracking, and pointing capabilities in laser weapon systems. Various methods have been developed to measure and predict atmospheric optical turbulence profiles, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Traditional approaches include temperature fluctuation methods using micro-temperature sensors and acoustic sounders, which provide direct measurements but suffer from limited range or efficiency. Optical observation techniques employing differential image motion monitors and multi-aperture scintillometers offer passive detection capabilities but are constrained by specific observation targets. Lidar-based methods have emerged as particularly promising, utilizing differential image motion, differential light column, and scintillation techniques to provide high-resolution vertical profiles with extended detection ranges. Complementing these detection technologies, prediction methodologies based on profile models, numerical weather prediction systems, and neural network approaches have made significant progress in forecasting C2<inf>n</inf> profiles. These prediction capabilities are especially valuable for planning operations in remote or harsh environments where continuous instrumental measurements are challenging or impossible. Progress Detection and prediction methods for the atmospheric refractive index structure constant C2<inf>n</inf> have been thoroughly examined. The overall detection methods for C2<inf>n</inf> were first presented (Fig. 1), detailing the characteristics of temperature pulsation methods and sodar detection techniques. The device structures of passive optical detection schemes were analyzed (Fig. 2), and a comparative analysis of parameters such as resolution and accuracy was conducted (Table 1). Among the various passive detection approaches, the Fang’s research team at Tsinghua University intensively studied wide-field wavefront sensors for turbulence detection with good results. Subsequently, it was noted that lidar detection technologies are generally more flexible than passive detection methods. Therefore, a focus was placed on the working principles, development processes, and accuracy indicators of lidar turbulence detection techniques, such as differential image motion and differential column image motion lidar. A comparison of parameters such as resolution and detection height was also provided (Table 2). Additionally, the principles and current research status of optical turbulence fusion detection technology were analyzed. Zhu et al. of Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics at Chinese Academy of Sciences have conducted in-depth research on various turbulence detection schemes. Following this, turbulence prediction technologies were introduced, including the available regions and data sources for various profile models (Tables 3 and 4). The working principles and research progress of weather forecast models such as WRF and neural network models were also discussed. Finally, conclusions were drawn, and future research directions were analyzed, highlighting trends in multi-source data fusion for detection technologies and the application of turbulence profiles for adaptive optics system correction. Conclusions and Prospects This review examines current turbulence detection and prediction technologies, detailing their characteristics and applicable limitations to inform optimal technology selection for diverse applications. In summary, turbulence profile acquisition will increasingly integrate multiple technologies, leading to miniaturized, intelligent detection hardware and advanced data processing algorithms that utilize neural networks for high-precision detection. Additionally, turbulence prediction will evolve towards comprehensive coverage and high temporal-spatial resolution, enabling accurate forecasting of C2<inf>n</inf> profiles. The integration of C2<inf>n</inf> profiles with adaptive optics systems offers significant potential for improving laser system performance and enhancing imaging quality in various applications. © 2025 Chinese Optical Society.

The study aims to assess the scale of destruction using satellite imagery, geoinformation technologies, and automated data processing algorithms. The research consists of two analytical case studies. The first case examines the destruction of buildings in Moshchun (Kyiv region) by comparing satellite images taken before and after the full-scale invasion. To improve the accuracy of damage assessment, the analysis results were verified using aerial imagery obtained after the de-occupation of the area. It was determined that the number of destroyed or damaged buildings in the village due to hostilities amounted to 663, of which 590 were completely destroyed. The second case focuses on determining the extent of building destruction in Mariupol by comparing multi-temporal satellite images with vector building layers that reflect the state of urban development before the onset of hostilities. The analysis was conducted using image processing algorithms and geospatial analysis implemented in the Python environment.

Traditional OSDI frameworks often rely on social media data, which are susceptible to misinformation and credibility issues. This study proposes a novel AI-driven framework utilizing automated data collection from 444 large-scale online news portals, including CNN, BBC, CBS News, and The Guardian, to enhance data reliability. Over a 514-day period (27 September 2023 to 26 February 2025), 1.25 million news articles were collected, of which 17,884 were autonomously classified as disaster-related using Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models. The analysis identified 185 distinct countries and 6068 unique locations, offering unprecedented geospatial and temporal intelligence. Advanced clustering and predictive analytics techniques, including K-means, DBSCAN, seasonal decomposition (STL), Fourier transform, and ARIMA, were employed to detect geographical hotspots, cyclical patterns, and temporal dependencies. The ARIMA (2, 1, 2) model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 823,761, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. Key findings highlight that the USA (6548 disasters), India (1393 disasters), and Australia (1260 disasters) are the most disaster-prone countries, while hurricanes/typhoons/cyclones (5227 occurrences), floods (3360 occurrences), and wildfires (2724 occurrences) are the most frequent disaster types. The framework establishes a comprehensive methodology for integrating geospatial clustering, temporal analysis, and multimodal data processing in OSDI. By leveraging AI automation and diverse news sources, this study provides a scalable, adaptable, and ethically robust solution for proactive disaster management, improving global resilience and preparedness. © 2025 by the authors.","AI; disaster intelligence; geospatial and temporal intelligence; news media data mining; open-source disaster intelligence; predictive disaster modeling","","","","","","","","Sufi, Fahim K., Knowledge Discovery of Global Landslides Using Automated Machine Learning Algorithms, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 131400-131419, (2021); Arxiv, (2020); Murayama, Taichi, Modeling the spread of fake news on Twitter, PLoS ONE, 16, 4 April, (2021); Amatya, Pukar Man, Landslide mapping using object-based image analysis and open source tools, Engineering Geology, 282, (2021); J Econ Technol, (2024); Zhou, Jinyan, Visual and Linguistic Double Transformer Fusion Model for Multimodal Tweet Classification, Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2023-June, (2023); Koshy, Rani, Multimodal tweet classification in disaster response systems using transformer-based bidirectional attention model, Neural Computing and Applications, 35, 2, pp. 1607-1627, (2023); Ji, Ziwei, Survey of Hallucination in Natural Language Generation, ACM Computing Surveys, 55, 12, (2023); Arxiv, (2023); Ranjan Sahoo, Somya Ranjan, Real-time detection of fake account in twitter using machine-learning approach, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1086, pp. 149-159, (2021)","F.

By leveraging the spectral dimension, it provides insights into the material structure and chemical composition of observed targets. Imaging spectroscopy generates a three-dimensional dataset, combining two-dimensional spatial data with one-dimensional spectral data. This approach not only captures the spatial characteristics of targets but also performs continuous spectral analysis for each resolvable spatial pixel. The integration of imaging and spectroscopy facilitates a higher-dimensional representation of target features, offering a robust and scientifically comprehensive foundation for precise detection, accurate identification, and reliable verification of targets. Consequently, it holds significant application potential in domains such as space exploration, aerial remote sensing, astronomical observation, environmental monitoring, and resource surveying. Advanced spectral techniques form the foundation of imaging spectroscopy, with Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS) standing out due to its inherent advantages, including multi-channel detection (Fellgett advantage), high throughput (Jacquinot advantage), and high wavenumber precision (Connes advantage). In addition, FTS excels in performance characteristics such as minimal stray light interference, broad free spectral range, high spectral resolution, and high signal-to-noise ratio. Since its inception, FTS has attracted substantial research interest and has become a critical tool for structural analysis and molecular characterization in fields like physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, environmental science, and materials science. Progress We begin by detailing the optical path configurations and modulation principles of Michelson, Mach-Zehnder, and Sagnac interference structures, highlighting their application in various modulation techniques. The interference imaging principles and data structures of temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal modulated Fourier transform spectral imaging (FTSI) are then elucidated in alignment with their data acquisition modalities (Fig. 10). A comprehensive review of FTSI’s historical development and current research status is provided, highlighting representative studies that discuss the interference structures employed as well as the resulting spectral and imaging performance. Spatiotemporal modulated FTSI, noted for its static structure and high throughput, represents a primary focus for technological advancement. For example, the Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics, and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences has conducted extensive research in this field. Using a step mirror Michelson interferometer, the institute has developed prototypes such as the image-field modulated Fourier transform hyperspectral imager (Fig. 40) and the panoramic bispectral infrared imaging interferometric spectral measurement and inversion instrument (Fig. 41). These innovations are designed to meet the critical demands for real-time, online monitoring and analysis of industrial pollution emissions and emergency safety incidents. Finally, the prospective trajectories of FTSI technology are explored, providing strategic guidance for the selection and design of FTSI instruments tailored to practical applications. Conclusions and Prospects Fourier transform spectral imaging technology, leveraging diverse interference modulation structures and imaging modalities, manifests in multiple implementation forms. Each form offers unique strengths and limitations, necessitating careful selection based on specific tasks, operational conditions, and performance expectations. Ultra-precision optics, large-format detectors, high-speed readout circuits, and advanced data processing methods continue to evolve. FTSI instruments are anticipated to adopt architectures that are solid-state, integrated, lightweight, miniaturized, and even micro-miniaturized. Future detection paradigms will likely emphasize static, high-throughput, high-stability, high-reliability, real-time detection, online analysis, and intelligent processing. Expected system enhancements include wider fields of view, broader spectral ranges, higher spatial and spectral resolutions, improved wavenumber accuracy, elevated signal-to-noise ratios, greater sensitivity, and expanded dynamic ranges. These advancements are set to drive transformative influences across a spectrum of military, defense, and civilian applications, solidifying FTSI as a cornerstone technology for the future. © 2025 Chinese Optical Society.

This article focuses on the non-military use of UAVs to support governance at the lowest level of local government in Poland - municipalities (gminas). The study had a pilot and inventory-based character. Its main objective was to determine whether municipalities are using UAVs, for what purposes, and under what conditions. The statutory responsibilities of municipalities served as a framework for assessing areas of application. In particular, the study examined whether UAVs support basic data collection or more advanced functions such as informing, analysis and control, planning support, or decision-making. To facilitate the assessment, the UAV Maturity Model for Local Government (UMMfLG) was developed. Data were collected from 22 municipalities located in the northern part of the Silesian Voivodeship in Poland. The findings suggest that UAV usage remains at an early stage of the UMMfLG. However, the observed trends indicate that adoption is likely to expand in the future. Current barriers include a lack of technical knowledge, organizational and financial constraints, and limited access to complementary technologies such as image processing software or Geographic Information Systems (GIS). © 2025 The Authors.

It provides a critical solution to the bottleneck in space-to-ground data transmission bandwidth and addresses delays associated with data processing in traditional models. This technology plays a vital role in various domains，particularly in military reconnaissance，where it enables the acquisition of high-resolution imagery for intelligence gathering，and in disaster emergency monitoring，where it allows for the timely detection and assessment of disasters. However，current onboard processing hardware systems exhibit significant limitations in terms of functional coverage and their ability to handle complex tasks. Most existing research focuses on individual processing steps or relatively simple tasks，making it difficult to adequately meet the demands of modern spaceborne missions. These missions often require the integration of multiple functions and high-performance processing capabilities that current systems cannot provide. To overcome these limitations，this paper presents the design of a large-scale onboard processing system for spaceborne SAR. The proposed system supports a variety of operations，including data preprocessing，SAR imaging，ship detection，refocusing，target recognition，and geometric correction. Of particular note are two advanced capabilities：wide-area ship detection and recognition. A multi-task compatible approach based on multi-node collaborative reconstruction underpins the system’s design. This method informs the development of a detailed hardware architecture comprising several dedicated processing boards. The interactive master control board manages data input，preprocessing，and distribution，serving as the central hub for system-wide data flow. The detection board is responsible for target detection and refocusing tasks，aiming to accurately identify and re-image blurred moving targets. The imaging board，equipped with dedicated System-on-Chip（SoC）chips，performs high-speed SAR imaging to ensure the production of high-quality，high-resolution images. The recognition board handles false alarm rejection and target recognition，providing classification information for detected objects. Specialized data flow and pipeline designs have been developed to support wide-area ship detection and recognition functions. In the wide-area ship detection process，preprocessed data is distributed to the appropriate boards，followed by SAR imaging，target detection，false alarm rejection，moving target localization，and geometric correction. For wide-area ship recognition，the process includes additional steps，refocusing and recognition，after detection to enable precise identification. The system’s functionality and performance were verified through a series of experiments using a simulated signal source to generate spaceborne SAR echo data. The experimental results demonstrate that the SAR imaging function meets the required standards in terms of resolution，peak sidelobe ratio（PSLR），and integrated sidelobe ratio（ISLR）. The system achieves a target detection rate of 93.7%，with a false alarm density of 2.96 per 10000 square kilometers. In terms of processing efficiency， the wide-area ship detection function reaches a 1∶2 near-real-time processing level，whereas the wide-area ship recognition function achieves a 1∶2.5 near-real-time level. In conclusion，the proposed system exhibits excellent processing quality and impressive imaging speed，offering a valuable reference for the future development of large-scale onboard processing technologies for spaceborne SAR applications. © 2025, Editorial Board of Journal of Signal Processing.

However, designing such a network for onboard deployment is challenging, as it must achieve high performance while maintaining low computational and memory requirements and ensuring real-time processing capabilities. UAVs typically operate at high altitudes, providing broad ground coverage; however, this results in key objects—such as humans, vehicles, and obstacles—appearing smaller in the imagery, thereby complicating their accurate identification. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight semantic segmentation network and a network-agnostic loss specifically designed for UAV imagery. The dual sparsity transformer (DST) incorporates two forms of sparsity: data-based sparsity, which reduces computational complexity, and content-based sparsity, which filters out irrelevant information to generate more refined aggregated features. The novel loss leverages predicted contours to capture complex patterns, boundaries, and small objects, imposing a higher penalty for misclassifications in these areas. This encourages the network to prioritize the accurate detection of challenging-to-distinguish objects. Our approach exhibits remarkable accuracy and real-time throughput for 4k resolution images on a mobile GPU, highlighting its effectiveness for onboard deployment in UAV systems. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Lightweight neural network; remote sensing; semantic segmentation; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Antennas; Complex networks; Image enhancement; Real time systems; Semantic Segmentation; Semantic Web; Semantics; Aerial vehicle; Dual sparsities; Images segmentations; Lightweight neural network; Neural-networks; Real- time; Remote-sensing; Semantic segmentation; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle images; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); artificial neural network; data processing; image resolution; remote sensing; semantic standardization; unmanned vehicle","","","","","","","Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision Eccv, (2018); Yu, Changqian, BiSeNet V2: Bilateral Network with Guided Aggregation for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation, International Journal of Computer Vision, 129, 11, pp. 3051-3068, (2021); Fu, Jun, Dual attention network for scene segmentation, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019-June, pp. 3141-3149, (2019); Fan, Mingyuan, Rethinking BiSeNet For Real-time Semantic Segmentation, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 9711-9720, (2021); An Image is Worth 16x16 Words Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale, (2020); Carion, Nicolas, End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12346 LNCS, pp. 213-229, (2020); Zheng, Sixiao, Rethinking Semantic Segmentation from a Sequence-to-Sequence Perspective with Transformers, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 6877-6886, (2021); Zhu, Lei, BiFormer: Vision Transformer with Bi-Level Routing Attention, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2023-June, pp. 10323-10333, (2023); Jiao, Jiayu, DilateFormer: Multi-Scale Dilated Transformer for Visual Recognition, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 25, pp. 8906-8919, (2023); Park, Namuk, HOW DO VISION TRANSFORMERS WORK?, ICLR 2022 - 10th International Conference on Learning Representations, (2022)","M.

This paper presents a method for acquiring and processing hyperspectral data to enhance its applicability in deep learning analysis. We explore visualization strategy under controlled experimental conditions. A key contribution of this study is the introduction of three evaluation criteria: entropy, correlation, and Jaccard score for assessing band pertinence during pre-processing. These criteria help optimize data selection by filtering out noisy or redundant spectral bands, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of subsequent analysis. Our results demonstrate that strategic band selection enhances camouflage detection in military and security applications, particularly by leveraging the hyperspectral differentiation of natural and artificial materials. The proposed methodology streamlines hyperspectral data processing, making it more effective for integration with artificial neural networks in various domains, including surveillance, environmental monitoring, and target recognition. © 2025 IEEE.","AI; camouflage detection; cybernetics; hyperspectral imaging; remote sensing; spectral analysis","Camouflage; Deep learning; Environmental engineering; Filtration; Hyperspectral imaging; Military applications; Network security; Neural networks; Security systems; Strategic materials; Camouflage detection; Data cleaning; Evaluation criteria; Experimental conditions; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral Data; Remote-sensing; RGB imaging; Spectral analyze; Spectral information; Remote sensing; Spectrum analysis","","","","","","","Raouhi, El Mehdi, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Applications in Smart Farming: A Systematic Review, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 14, 6, pp. 1150-1165, (2023); Zhang, Chenglong, Unsupervised band selection of medical hyperspectral images guided by data gravitation and weak correlation, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 240, (2023); Kutílek, Patrik, Camera System for Efficient non-contact Measurement in Distance Medicine, Proceedings of the 2020 19th International Conference on Mechatronics - Mechatronika, ME 2020, (2020); Vogtli, Marius, Hyperthun'22: A Multi-Sensor Multi-Temporal Camouflage Detection Campaign, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2023-July, pp. 2153-2156, (2023); Widdicombe, Bryce, Target detection from limited number of spectral bands using a signature-based machine learning, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 11865, (2021); Popov, Mykhailo O., Method for Minefields Mapping by Imagery from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Advances in Military Technology, 17, 2, pp. 211-229, (2022); A Manifold Learning Approach to Target Detection in High Resolution Hyperspectral Imagery, (2015); Euro Security Features, (2025); Jang, Hye-ji, Ultraviolet Light-Assisted Decontamination of Chemical Warfare Agent Simulant 2-Chloroethyl Phenyl Sulfide on Metal-Loaded TiO2/Ti Surfaces, ChemistryOpen, 13, 8, (2024); Applied Spectroscopy Reviews, (2021)","J.

This technique is widely used in remote sensing, environmental monitoring, military reconnaissance, and other fields. Existing HAD methods face high computational costs, feature redundancy, and poor segmentation, which results in high-dimensional data processing and detection efficiency. To address these issues, this article proposes an isolation forest (iForest) method based on OCF and Otsu (OOIF), which is based on the assumption that anomalous pixels are more easily isolated than normal pixels. Specifically, when constructing the isolation tree (iTree) structure, OOIF first uses the optimal clustering framework (OCF) to select band combinations that are information-rich and low-correlated. Secondly, this method introduces Otsu's method to optimize the selection of hyperplane intercepts for iTree partitioning. By calculating the slope that maximizes data separation, the accuracy of each split is further enhanced. Experimental results show that the algorithm performs better than the comparative algorithms on multiple datasets. © 2025 IEEE.","anomaly detection; hyperspectral image; isolation forest","Computational efficiency; Data handling; Forestry; Geology; Hyperspectral imaging; Pixels; Remote sensing; Anomaly detection; Environmental Monitoring; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral anomaly detection; Hyperspectral image; Isolation forest; Optimal clustering; Remote-sensing; Spectral characteristics; Surrounding environment","","","","","","","Reed, Irving S., Adaptive Multiple-Band CFAR Detection of an Optical Pattern with Unknown Spectral Distribution, IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 38, 10, pp. 1760-1770, (1990); Hou, Zengfu, Collaborative representation with background purification and saliency weight for hyperspectral anomaly detection, Science China Information Sciences, 65, 1, (2022); Li, Lu, Low-Rank and Sparse Decomposition with Mixture of Gaussian for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 51, 9, pp. 4363-4372, (2021); Fan, Ganghui, Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection with Robust Graph Autoencoders, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 60, (2022); Gao, Lianru, BS3LNet: A New Blind-Spot Self-Supervised Learning Network for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 61, (2023); Lin, Sheng, Dynamic Low-Rank and Sparse Priors Constrained Deep Autoencoders for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 73, pp. 1-18, (2024); He, Xu, Anomaly Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery via Tensor Low-Rank Approximation With Multiple Subspace Learning, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 61, (2023); Zhang, Kunzhong, Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Images, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), pp. 437-440, (2019); Li, Shutao, Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection with Kernel Isolation Forest, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 58, 1, pp. 319-329, (2020); Wang, Rong, Multiple Features and Isolation Forest-Based Fast Anomaly Detector for Hyperspectral Imagery, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 58, 9, pp. 6664-6676, (2020)","J.

Our distributed resilient remote sensing platform, a robust real-time distributed data processing system, addresses these challenges by leveraging Apache Storm framework. Our platform integrates Microsoft HoloLens and distributed computing components to support enhanced situational awareness and efficient data handling in critical operational environments. While Apache Storm’s default configurations struggled with recovery during node failures and network disconnections, we addressed these limitations through the design, development, and evaluation of our distributed resilient mobile sensing platform. The paper further discusses the methods used to test and evaluate the platform’s resiliency under different failure scenarios, demonstrating the system’s rapid recovery and sustained functionality, even under significant stress. Additionally, we explore parameter tuning techniques aimed at improving the platform’s recovery speed, specifically in scenarios involving node failures and network disconnection. The results show a significant reduction in recovery time, validating the platform’s robustness and scalability in real-world applications.

Traditional methods relying on ground data-processing centers suffer from poor timeliness and high communication resource consumption. In-orbit processing is gaining popularity, but developing fast and accurate ship detection methods with limited resources remains challenging. This study proposes SDNet, a lightweight network with super-resolution enhancement, and detail completion, for in-orbit detection of tiny ships. The main detector branch uses the adaptive cross-stage partial convolution (ACPC) module to form an efficient backbone. The feature pyramid network (FPN) combines with the cross-level wavelet transform multi-head attention (CWTMA) module for ship feature extraction. The absolute IoU (AIoU) loss aids in bounding box regression. The auxiliary branch uses the residual wavelet transform (RWT) module to generate a shallow super-resolution network, enhancing the main detector’s focus on the ship area. During inference, this auxiliary branch is removed to avoid additional computation. SDNet achieves 84.2% and 91.1% accuracy on Levir-Ship and HRSID datasets, which are 1.8% and 1.1% higher than DRENet. It outperforms other lightweight detectors in both accuracy and efficiency. For 512x512 input images, it has 4.86M parameters and requires 7.9G FLOPs. © 2025 The Author(s).

Real-time LiDAR is especially useful in applications that require immediate feedback or decision-making, such as post-earthquake emergency analysis, autonomous vehicles, precision agriculture, military applications, and infrastructure monitoring. For instance, rapid and real-time assessment of structural damage following disasters like earthquakes ensures the effective use of resources by directing first responders to priority areas. We focused on minimizing the time losses in pre-flight preparation and post-flight data processing processes at the low-altitude LiDAR mapping. To eliminate time losses, LiDAR data, which can be accessed via a web browser, were visualized as a real-time 3D point cloud. The X3D file format was used in this visualization process. To realize the accessibility and sharing of the data, HTML5 technologies were used, and the data were transferred to the cloud system in real time. Thus, a user-friendly system was developed that can make these data available to researchers simultaneously. We designed and developed a platform-independent web-based real-time LiDAR (WebRT-LiDAR) mapping system. As an application, the performance of the WebRT-LiDAR mapping system was evaluated by integrating it into a drone (low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) platform. The data received with this system can be stored in databases suitable for the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based systems. In this way, the system provides information, predictions, and capabilities that can be used in situations that require instant feedback or decision-making. In this context, the performance of the WebRT-LiDAR system can be further improved and tested in different scenarios, such as disaster management, war strategy, and efficient agriculture in future studies. © 2025 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","3D point cloud; real-time laser image detection and ranging; remote sensing; web-based UAV-LiDAR; X3D","Data curation; Deforestation; Emergency services; Military data processing; Military mapping; Optical radar; Photointerpretation; Reforestation; Target drones; Urban transportation; 3D point cloud; Image detection; Laser images; Real- time; Real-time laser image detection and ranging; Remote-sensing; Web based; Web-based UAV-laser image detection and ranging; X3D; Decision making","","","","","Kocaeli Üniversitesi, (FDK-2021-2561); Kocaeli Üniversitesi","This work was supported by the Kocaeli University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit (Grant no.

This has sparked significant growth in the private Earth observation (EO) industry. Despite the deployment of satellite constellations with improved spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions, there remains a bottleneck in data transmission and downlink capabilities, hindering efficient information extraction. Emerging technologies in artificial intelligence (AI), inter-satellite communication, and edge processing are promising to address these challenges, revolutionizing satellite missions and operations. The integration of intelligent payloads in various recent satellite demonstrators is marking progress towards autonomous satellite constellations. To meet the growing demand for autonomous and intelligent remote sensing, initiatives like the MOVIQ project are crucial. MOVIQ aims to enhance data processing efficiency and advance EO capabilities through agile satellite platforms, high-resolution optical payloads, fault-tolerant AI processors, advanced applications and streamlined integration and optimization frameworks.

Simultaneously, it addresses the challenge of GNSS signal interference, enhances the accuracy and efficiency of image retrieval, and meets the real-time processing needs of UAVs. In complex environments where GNSS signals are disrupted or rejected, traditional positioning methods prove ineffective. The fast cascade retrieval method we proposed significantly strengthens retrieval accuracy and efficiency by comprehensively utilizing local image features and adopting a two-level retrieval strategy. The method demonstrates feasibility and practicality in real-time processing, which provides reliable positioning support for UAVs in surveying and mapping, firefighting, agriculture, transportation, rescue, and military applications. This research holds crucial practical significance and immediate necessity. Methods We propose a fast cascade retrieval method for UAV images under GNSS rejection conditions, which achieves rapid positioning through a two-stage retrieval process (Fig. 1). Initially, a subset of aerial image datasets from Vienna, Austria, and Chicago, USA, along with corresponding commercial satellite image data, is selected for the experiment. To ensure data consistency and comparability, these images are cropped and size-normalized for subsequent retrieval. Subsequently, hash codes and feature point data are extracted from satellite images to construct hash and feature point databases, respectively, thereby improving retrieval efficiency and avoiding redundant calculations. In the initial retrieval stage, the wavelet hashing method is employed by incorporating spatial information. This method extracts low-frequency spatial components from the image using wavelet transform, generates hash codes, and utilizes these codes for rapid retrieval. The specific steps are as follows. First, the satellite image undergoes wavelet transformation to extract low-frequency components, and then the resulting hash codes are stored in the hash database. Similarly, the UAV image is processed to generate corresponding hash codes, which are used for rapid matching to identify candidate sets of satellite images similar to that of UAVs. In the secondary retrieval stage, an improved superpoint fast feature retrieval network (ISFFRN, Fig. 2) is employed to further retrieve and rank images based on local features of both UAV and satellite images. The steps involve using the ISFFRN to extract local feature points from UAV and candidate satellite images, followed by matching these feature points and calculating the number of matched pairs. The retrieval results are then sorted based on the number of matching point pairs to determine the final retrieval outcomes. The entire experiment is conducted using the Jetson AGX Orin hardware device to evaluate the method’s feasibility and real-time performance on an actual airborne platform. Results and Discussions The fast cascade retrieval method for UAV images with GNSS rejection proposed in this paper performs well on Jetson AGX Orin hardware devices, with an average processing time controlled within 0.5 s to meet the requirements of real-time positioning tasks. In the first retrieval stage, the wavelet hashing method is used to generate hash codes by extracting low-frequency spatial information from the image, and a candidate set of similar satellite images is quickly selected through matching (Figs. 4 and 5). Experimental results demonstrate that the wavelet hashing algorithm effectively captures global features and texture information from the image, which exhibits good adaptability and robustness. In the second retrieval stage, the ISFFRN is employed to determine the final retrieval results by extracting local feature points from UAV images and candidate satellite images, followed by matching and sorting. Experiments show that the ISFFRN completes the retrieval based on the ToCP@1 index (Figs. 6 and 7), confirming the feasibility of the ISFFRN for heterogeneous image retrieval (Fig. 8). Regarding performance evaluation, the entire experimental process is conducted on image data from Vienna, Austria, and Chicago, USA, utilizing Jetson AGX Orin hardware equipment, with experiment times recorded (Tables 4 and 5). Experimental results show that the cascade retrieval method can successfully achieve fast retrieval of UAV images. In the first search, ToCP@1 is 0, which indicates that the correct UAV image is not directly matched by the first satellite image after sorting the search results. However, ToCP@6 is 50%, which indicates that the correctly matched satellite image ranks second among the first six retrieved images. Although it does not achieve direct matching initially, it significantly narrows down the retrieval range and successfully locates the target image in subsequent results. In the second retrieval, ToCP@1 is 100% following the screening from the first retrieval. This demonstrates the cascade retrieval method’s effectiveness in accurately identifying and retrieving the correct satellite image, which ranks first in the similarity ranking. In summary, the fast cascade retrieval method for UAV images under GNSS rejection conditions achieves real-time airborne retrieval of UAV images by leveraging both global and local image features. The method comprehensively considers the characteristics of multi-source remote sensing images and effectively addresses the challenge of fast UAV image retrieval in GNSS-rejected environments. Conclusions Aiming at the problem of UAV positioning with GNSS rejection, we propose a fast cascade retrieval method that combines global and local features of satellite and UAV images. Its feasibility is verified using airborne equipment. Experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage cascade retrieval method achieves an average processing time of under 0.5 seconds on Jetson AGX Orin hardware, which meets the real-time requirements for GNSS RF and makes it suitable for real-time positioning of airborne equipment. In the first retrieval stage, the wavelet hash image retrieval algorithm, which integrates spatial information, shows robustness under the ToCP@6 index. However, adjustments to the hash length are necessary to ensure accuracy when dealing with images of varying scales. In the secondary retrieval, the ISFFRN successfully completes retrieval under the ToCP@1 index, thus confirming the feasibility of ISFFRN in heterogeneous image retrieval. To conclude, by leveraging both global and local image features, our method achieves real-time airborne retrieval of UAV images, which effectively tackles the challenge of fast UAV image retrieval in GNSS-denied environments. It exhibits high accuracy and robustness, meeting experimental expectations. © 2024 Chinese Optical Society.

Robot finds applications in industries for large-scale production, healthcare for computer-aided surgeries, security for surveillance of electrical power system equipment, and the military for carrying out dangerous reconnaissance. Most robotic systems employed for different operations use a wheeled mode of locomotion which has limitations over rough terrains and the issue of communication setup of the system. This work developed a hexapod, a six-legged robotic system, to overcome these identified challenges. The robot was developed in tandem with a telemetry system for surveillance. Although, automating the surveillance process using robotic systems has been in the works for some time. However, this work developed a telemetry hexapod robotic system for enhanced surveillance for the security of power systems equipment and other critical infrastructures using a Raspberry Pi for fast, secure data transmission, and precise system synchronization. An inverse kinematics approach was used to determine joint configurations for better positions of each endpoint. A digital camera was integrated into the robot to relay real-time images of adversaries of power system components intelligently. In addition, the system incorporates data processing capability. In the result obtained, the developed telemetry hexapod robotic system receives instructions over a distance slightly above 300 m. It establishes effective control of the telemetry system without any hindrance of a limited range as observed in Bluetooth-controlled systems. The system's performance includes an average efficiency of 98.2 %, latency of 0.48 s at the peak distance, and an endurance of 4 h. Further analysis of the system shows that the corresponding increase in the latency with the distance is negligible. The system performed better than other related systems considered in the literature. The correct implementation of the developed telemetry hexapod robotic system further enhances mobility, stability in rough terrain, reliable communication system. Also, it brings about a notable reduction in component theft in electrical power systems. © 2024 The Author(s)","Central pattern generator (CPG); Hexapod robot; Inverse kinematics; Raspberry Pi; Telemetry","","","","","","National Research Foundation, NRF, (150574)","This work is based on the research supported wholly / in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Numbers: 150574)\u201D; and Tshwane University of Technology - Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment and Centre for Energy and Electric Power.","Wang, Guanyu, Minimizing the Energy Consumption for a Hexapod Robot Based on Optimal Force Distribution, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 5393-5406, (2020); Oliveira, L.

It involves the deployment of a constellation of low-orbit satellites, including Carcará I and Carcará II SAR-based microsatellites with dual purposes, addressing both military and civilian needs. The Lessonia-1 satellites provide real-time data for disaster response and management. They monitor natural events such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods, landslides and enhancing surveillance of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and border control operations. By capturing SAR images, Lessonia-1 satellites enhance situational awareness during emergencies, enabling timely interventions and resource allocation. SAR technology enables satellites to penetrate cloud cover, providing valuable observations of terrain, even in regions like the Amazon rainforest. Space Operations Center (COPE) has been tasked to acquire imagery from Lessonia-1 SAR to support joint operations to mitigate natural disasters, for instance, flooding and wildfires. This paper aims to explore the characteristics and implementation of the Lessonia-1 SAR Project, operating in X band, with VV polarization imagery in different imaging modes and resolutions to support the wildfire and flooding events in Brazil.

The research was conducted in a mixed forest stand in the Březina military training area, where the position of trees and their DBHs (Diameter Breast Heights) were recorded. The study compared the effectiveness of different methods, including UAV RGB imaging, UAV-LiDAR, and handheld mobile laser scanning (HMLS), in detecting tree positions and estimating DBH. The results indicate that HMLS data provided the highest number of detected trees and the most accurate positioning relative to the reference measurements. UAV-LiDAR showed better tree detection compared to UAV RGB imaging, though both aerial methods struggled with canopy penetration in densely structured forests. The study also found significant variability in DBH estimation, especially in complex forest stands, highlighting the challenges of accurate tree detection in diverse environments. The findings suggest that while current non-contact methods show promise, further refinement and integration of data sources are necessary to improve their applicability for assessing forest passability in military or rescue contexts. © 2024 by the authors.","DBH; forest passability; HMLS; military operation; off-road vehicle; terrain vehicle; TLS; UAV","Air mobility; Deforestation; Fighter aircraft; Meteorological radar; Military data processing; Military helicopters; Military mapping; Military vehicles; Optical radar; Reforestation; Road vehicles; Synthetic aperture radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Breast height; Diameter breast height; Forest passability; Handheld mobile laser scanning; Handhelds; Laser scanning; Off-road vehicles; Passability; Terrain vehicles; TLS; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Off road vehicles; forest canopy; lidar; mapping; stand structure; tree; unmanned vehicle; Contacting; Data Processing; Detection; Methods; Scanning; Trees","","","","","","","State of Europes Forests 2020, (2020); Ecosystems and Human Well Being Synthesis, (2005); Rybanský, Marian, Determination the ability of military vehicles to override vegetation, Journal of Terramechanics, 91, pp. 129-138, (2020); Barone, P.

With continuous advancements in deep learning algorithms and models, LiDAR point cloud processing has also progressed toward intelligence. However, due to the higher dimensionality of point cloud data, deep learning networks require more computational and inferential resources in their design and processing than two-dimensional data processing. This limits the direct deployment of point cloud processing deep learning models on many edge devices. Therefore, compressing point cloud processing deep learning models and achieving hardware-accelerated deployment have emerged as popular research directions. To comprehensively analyze current research progress on compressing and deploying point cloud processing deep learning models, we presented the first comprehensive review focusing on the compression of these models both domestically and internationally. First, we classified compression methods for point cloud processing deep learning models and outlined general approaches used in the compression process. Second, we summarized and compared relevant literature on compression techniques for point cloud processing deep learning model across five aspects: model pruning, quantization, distillation, tensor decomposition, and compactness. Additionally, we discussed methods for hardware acceleration of point cloud processing deep learning models and explored the synergy between software and hardware acceleration. Finally, we provided insights and conclusions about the future prospects of compressing and deploying point cloud processing deep learning models. © 2024 Universitat zu Koln.

Each participant was instrumented with two inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a GPS watch. Custom code synchronized accelerometer and positional data without a priori sensor synchronization, calibrated orientation of the IMUs in the tibial reference frame, detected and separated only periods of walking or running, and computed acceleration and spatiotemporal outcomes. GPS positional data were georeferenced with geographic information system (GIS) maps to extract terrain features such as slope, altitude, and surface conditions. This paper reveals the ease at which similar data can be gathered among relatively large groups of people with minimal setup and automated data processing. The methods described here can be adapted to other populations and similar ground-based activities such as skiing or trail running. © 2024 by the authors.","data fusion; GIS; GPS; hiking; inertial measurement unit; military; ruck march; wearable sensor","Accelerometers; Inertial navigation systems; Information fusion; Metadata; Military data processing; Military mapping; Network security; Sensor data fusion; Spatio-temporal data; Acceleration rates; Gait parameters; Gait pattern; Geographic information; Heart-rate; Hiking; Inertial measurements units; Military; Ruck march; Terrain features; Global positioning system; acceleration; accelerometry; adult; devices; female; gait; geographic information system; heart rate; human; male; movement (physiology); physiology; procedures; running; tibia; walking; Acceleration; Accelerometry; Adult; Female; Gait; Geographic Information Systems; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Movement; Running; Tibia; Walking","","","","","Office of Naval Research, ONR, (62333); Office of Naval Research, ONR","AS, EW, BG and NH are employees of the U.S. Government.

In order to make the military aircraft inspection model run efficiently on the equipment with limited computing power, the lightweight improvement of YOLOv8n is carried out from two aspects: network design and model compression. In the aspect of network design, firstly, FAS_C2f is used to replace the C2f module in the original backbone network, which reduces the computational redundancy and speeds up the network feature extraction. Secondly, the network structure is optimized according to the scale characteristics of military aircraft targets to alleviate the problem of small target information loss caused by excessive downsampling. Thirdly, Inner-SIoU is used as a new localization regression loss function to improve the learning ability of small target samples and accelerate the convergence of regression bounding box. In terms of model compression, channel pruning based on LAMP fraction is used to compress the redesigned model to further reduce parameters and model size. With channel-wise knowledge distillation (CWD), the accuracy of the model is restored to the level close to that before pruning. The experimental results show that on the open military aircraft data set MAR20, the mAP of the lightweight model is 97.2%, the volume is only 0.7 MB, which is 88.3% smaller than the original model, and the FPS is increased by 14 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirements of military aircraft target detection. © 2024 Journal of Computer Engineering and Applications Beijing Co., Ltd.; Science Press.

One of the most popular examples of VGI is the collaborative OpenStreetMap (OSM) project which covers a wide range of themes or characteristics associated with the real world. One of these themes is the feature “waterway” that represents watercourses. The quality of OSM data characteristics is a topic that has been published by many authors in recent years, particularly on the analysis of the completeness indicator. However, few references are found in the literature about studies that analyse the completeness of OSM watercourses or even watercourses obtained by other sources. All this motivated the authors to develop a study that aims to analyse the completeness of these specific lines that have so much relevance to hydrologists. The study presents an analysis of the variation over time in completeness/coverage of the OSM “waterway” feature in the period between 2014 and 2023 in a mountainous region included in the Mondego River basin, located in the Inland of Portugal. The methodology applied is supported by classical methods of measuring the completeness of lines that may be found in the literature. The total length of the watercourses was calculated and compared in percentage terms with the total length of the reference watercourses for dates under analysis. The watercourses of the military official hydrography of the 1/25,000 scale were used as a reference. The relation of the OSM completeness with some indicators related to terrain surface (altitude, slope, and location/proximity settlements) was also analysed. The choice of these indicators was motivated by the fact that the study area has strong mountain characteristics and is crossed by the main Portuguese river. The analysis was performed using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) data and satellite image of Geographic Information System software. The results show that the completeness of this OSM feature (waterway) has a slight increase, considering the amplitude of the studied period (nine years) and the fact that, nowadays, digital mobile devices enable easy access to satellite images, allowing the digitalization of geographic entities or objects of the real world remotely. Regarding the indicator altitude, slope, and location/proximity of the settlements, we believe that there is no influence of these indicators on the evolution of the completeness of the OSM waterways in the study area. © 2024 by the authors.","completeness; OpenStreetMap; VGI; waterway","Computer software selection and evaluation; Damage detection; Directed-energy weapons; Fighter aircraft; Military data processing; Photomapping; Proximity indicators; Radar cross section; River basin projects; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tachometers; Completeness; Geographic information; Openstreetmap; Portugal; Real-world; Satellite images; Study areas; Total length; Voluntary geographic information; Waterway; Rivers","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UID/05488/2020, UIDB/00308/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology under the project grant: (i) UID/05488/2020 and (ii) UIDB/00308/2020 (with the DOI 10.54499/UIDB/00308/2020).","Bao, Linan, Water extraction in SAR images using features analysis and dual-threshold graph cut model, Remote Sensing, 13, 17, (2021); Jiang, Hao, An automated method for extracting rivers and lakes from Landsat imagery, Remote Sensing, 6, 6, pp. 5067-5089, (2014); Al-Bakri, Maythm M., Assessing the accuracy of 'crowdsourced' data and its integration with official spatial data sets, Accuracy 2010 - Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Spatial Accuracy Assessment in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, pp. 317-320, (2010); Biljecki, Filip, Quality of crowdsourced geospatial building information: A global assessment of OpenStreetMap attributes, Building and Environment, 237, (2023); Girres, Jean François, Quality Assessment of the French OpenStreetMap Dataset, Transactions in GIS, 14, 4, pp. 435-459, (2010); Iso 19157 2013 Geographic Information Data Quality, (2013); Barrington-Leigh, Christopher P., The world’s user-generated road map is more than 80% complete, PLoS ONE, 12, 8, (2017); Goodchild, Michael F., Geographic information systems and science: Today and tomorrow, Annals of GIS, 15, 1, pp. 3-9, (2009); Proceedings of the 31st International Cartographic Conference Icc 2023; Hecht, Robert, Measuring completeness of building footprints in openstreetmap over space and time, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 2, 4, pp. 1066-1091, (2013)","E.S.V.

Among the relative effects of factors influencing the quantity and quality of health of newborns, the factors of military aggression are of great importance. The purpose of the study is to analyze and assess the consequences of a full-scale war with the Russian Federation for the medical provision and health of newborns. Research materials and methods. The research materials were data from scientific literature and medical statistics on the activities of health care institutions and institutions subordinated to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, which provide medical care for newborns at all stages of their development. The methods of system approach, bibliosemantic, comparative analysis and statistical data processing were applied. The results of the study: A comprehensive study of the impact of the factors of the full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, conducted at the population level, proved their negative impact on the frequency of low birth weight newborns from 5,99 % in 2021 to 6,09 % in 2023, OR with 95 % CI 1,04 (1,01-1,07), p<0,0012, the number of born sick and sick newborns from 196,93 to 269,47 ‰, OR with 95 % CI 1. 48 (1,46-1,50), p<0,0001 against the background of rapid decrease in the number of newborns (31,5 % loss rate) and preservation of sufficient resources for neonatology service. According to the data of geospatial analysis, a greater influence of negative consequences of military aggression was found in the regions with active hostilities and temporary occupation (I group) compared to the rear territories (II group) according to the frequency of low birth weight newborns – 6, 2 % in the I group and 6.05 % in the II group, OR with 95 % CI 1.16 (1.1-1.2), p<0.0001, and the frequency of sick and diseased newborns – 311.8 and 227.9 ‰, OR with 95 % CI 1.53 (1.49-1.57), p<0.0001. A violation of the logistics of medical care for newborns in the regions of the I group in comparison with the regions of the II group is shown, in particular, according to the data on the indicators of mortality (1,7 and 2,51 ‰, the rate of loss 30,68 %), lethality (0,55 and 1,1 %, the rate of loss 50,0 %) of newborns and early neonatal mortality (2,84 and 3,1 ‰, the rate of loss 8,38 %). Conclusions. In the course of the study, the hypothesis of the negative impact of military aggression on the main measures of newborn health was confirmed – the incidence of low birth weight and sick newborns with a greater impact on these indicators in regions of active hostilities and temporary occupation. © 2024 Bukovyna State Medical University.

By exploiting the data from remote sensing sensors, we aim to develop methodologies that can assist airport operations, including managing the risk of wildlife threats to runway safety, infrastructure maintenance, and foreign object debris (FOD) detection. Drones equipped with remote sensing sensors provide valuable insight into surface diagnostics, helping to assess aprons, taxiways, and runways. In addition, drones can enhance airport security with effective surveillance and threat detection capabilities, as well as provide data to support existing air traffic control models and systems. In this paper, we aim to present our experience with the potential airport applications of UAV high-resolution RGB, thermal, and LiDAR sensors.

Monitoring changes in coastline contours is an actual topic in the field of environmental, geological and information research. However, tasks of this kind are complex and require using modern methods of data processing and analysis, including Earth remote sensing data. One of the modern approaches to solving this class of problems is using machine learning methods, which is the focus of the research in this article. The object of the authors' research is the western coast of the Crimean Peninsula, the study of which by traditional methods has become impossible due to the temporary occupation of the Crimean Peninsula since 2014. In the last decade, the Crimean coastline could have undergone significant changes as a result of anthropogenic activities (including those related to military operations) and landslide-abrasive processes. In this study, the authors limit the study to changes in the coastline of the western part of the Crimean Peninsula over the last decade. Methods. Authors used CNN models (U-Net model) to effectively recognize the coastline and its boundaries in satellite images without the need for manual vectorization. Results. The research involved developing Python code to automatically generate reports including network accuracy (0.95) and loss function (0.19), facilitating the evaluation of different approaches and methods. Additionally, the study created scripts for using the trained network in the task of semantic segmentation and translating the result of the segmentation model into a vectorized result of the coastline contours of the Crimean Peninsula, which was represented as a probability raster. Conclusions. The use of this approach is useful for monitoring changes in the coastline of rivers, seas and lakes throughout Ukraine. © Okhrimchuk Roman, Demidov Vsevolod, Sliusar Kateryna, Lukomskyi Vladyslav, 2024.","Coastline; Convolutional Neural Network; Crimean Peninsula; U-Net model","","","","","","","","Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark, (2025); Dystantsiini Doslidzhennia Zemli Navch Posibnyk Vydavn Tsentr Lnu Im I Franka, (2010); Bayram, Bülent, THE EFFICIENCY of RANDOM FOREST METHOD for SHORELINE EXTRACTION from LANDSAT-8 and GOKTURK-2 IMAGERIES, ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 4, 4W4, pp. 141-145, (2017); Boyko, Kateryna, Quantitative regional landslide hazard prediction using GIS within the Southern coast of Crimea, 14th EAGE International Conference on Geoinformatics - Theoretical and Applied Aspects, Geoinformatics 2015, (2015); Odeskyi Natsionalnyi Universytet Imeni I I, (2021); Demir, Nusret, INTEGRATED SHORELINE EXTRACTION APPROACH with USE of RASAT MS and SENTINEL-1A SAR IMAGES, ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 4, 2W4, pp. 445-449, (2017); Int J Curr Eng Tech, (2017); Elnabwy, Mohamed T., An approach based on landsat images for shoreline monitoring to support integrated coastal management - A case study, ezbet elborg, nile delta, Egypt, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 9, 4, (2020); Ge, Xizhi, Object-oriented coastline classification and extraction from remote sensing imagery, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 9158, (2014); Goldstein, Evan B., A review of machine learning applications to coastal sediment transport and morphodynamics, Earth-Science Reviews, 194, pp. 97-108, (2019)","","","Kyiv University Publishing and Printing Center","","","","","","17282713","","","","English","Visnyk.

In the civil field, it can be employed to analyze the situations of airport flights and ships in ports and thus facilitate timely adjustment and avoid congestion. In the military field, enemies' military deployment is analyzed by the photographed images, and feasible plans are made to ensure successful military operations. Therefore, object detection of remote sensing images has research significance and application prospect. Compared with the traditional detection algorithms, the detection method based on the convolutional neural network has become the mainstream object detection of remote sensing images. The method based on deep learning can yield better accuracy than the traditional object detection methods of visible light remote sensing images, and it is unnecessary to manually design rules, which has a relatively unified standard and enhances the model robustness. However, there are still many defects in introducing the object detection model dealing with natural images directly into remote sensing tasks. Starting from the oriented object detection difficulties of remote sensing, we design an oriented object detection algorithm for optical remote sensing images to improve the feature extraction and feature recognition ability of multi-scale and multi-directional remote sensing small targets in complex backgrounds. Methods Aiming at the poor performance of general algorithms for remote sensing oriented object detection, we propose an oriented object detection model based on SWA training strategy and feature recombination. The model is optimized based on the Rotated RPN algorithm. On the one hand, the feature recombination mechanism is introduced to make the model focus on effective features, which can reduce unnecessary computing resources and improve the model accuracy. On the other hand, based on RPN, the rotating RPN is introduced, and the position and angle parameters are regressed by the midpoint offset method to generate high-quality directed candidate frames. For the required feature inconsistency between classification and regression tasks, a polarized attention detector is employed, and the training strategy is improved. Meanwhile, the model is trained by cyclic mode to alleviate the problem that the traditional training strategy will converge to the boundary region of the optimal solution. Specifically, we conduct the following improvements based on Rotated RPN. 1) Given the problems in the object detection tasks of remote sensing images, such as a large number of small targets, a large proportion of background, and a large change in target size, the feature pyramid can not extract effective information during extracting and fusing features, which degrades detection performance. Therefore, we consider making changes in the feature pyramid to strengthen the feature extraction ability of the feature pyramid and the ability to fully fuse information of various sizes. Additionally, the reshape module is designed and integrated into the Carafe model as a deep horizontal connection of FPN. 2) To solve the problems of angle discontinuity and edge order exchange in the critical angle of the common directed box representation, we introduce the midpoint offset method to define the directed box. An adaptive attention module is designed in front of the suggested area generation module to enhance the ability of effective feature representation and further strengthen the ability of feature extraction and characterization. 3) The features required for the classification task should have the same response to different angles, which is because the focus of the classification task should be on the target itself. Thus, it should be highly responsive to the effective information inside the prediction frame, while the features required for the regression task should be sensitive to the angle change. Meanwhile, more attention should be paid to the boundary area of the target and less attention is to the information inside the prediction frame for realizing accurate angle and position prediction and reducing interference. Therefore, to avoid feature interference between different tasks and extract key features, we introduce a polarization attention module to the shared convolution layer at the front end of the dual-branch detector and adopt different response functions to distinguish the representation ability of different features. The classification head and regression head employ an activation function and an inhibition function respectively. 4) In view of the limitation that the traditional training strategy may converge to the boundary region of the optimal solution, we introduce the SWA cyclic training strategy, obtain the corresponding weights by adopting the SGD method to train more epochs, and average these results to acquire results closest to the optimal solution. Results and Discussions To verify the algorithm performance, we select two remote sensing oriented annotation datasets Dior-R and HRSC2016 to compare the algorithm performance. Several typical one-stage and two-stage oriented object detection models are selected and compared with this model. On the Dior-R dataset, our algorithm yields the best accuracy of 64. 49%, 4. 95% higher than that of the benchmark model (Table 5). On the HRSC2016 dataset, the proposed algorithm achieves the best accuracy of 90. 83%, which is 11. 75% higher than that of the benchmark model (Table 7). Additionally, we analyze the performance improvement after introducing the feature recombination module, focus shift method, adaptive attention module, polarized attention detector, and SWA training strategy respectively. The experimental results show that the algorithm has sound detection performance for remote sensing oriented objects in complex backgrounds. Conclusions To improve the detection performance of oriented objects in remote sensing images, we propose an oriented object detection model based on feature recombination and polarized attention. The experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively detect oriented objects in remote sensing images, and has good performance in all kinds of scenes. © 2024 Chinese Optical Society.

This research examines super-resolution approaches, with a specific emphasis on three Deep Learning Neural Models: Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN). The study does a rigorous comparison investigation of these models, with the goal of determining their effectiveness in producing high-resolution aerial photographs. In order to conduct a thorough evaluation of these models, a wide range of datasets is utilised, which includes MNIST, Fashion MNIST, DIV2K, and DOTA. This extensive range of options enables a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance across a wide range of data complexities, ranging from simple geometric forms to complicated real-world aerial landscapes. This research offers detailed analysis of the datasets, allowing for a thorough examination of the strengths and shortcomings of the models. It provides valuable insights into how these models might be applied to real-world military situations. The results of this study have important consequences for military intelligence.

The flood inundation range can be obtained by using traditional simulation methods, but these methods still have shortcomings. This work proposes an optimization method for traditional methods. Methods: This study aims to introduce an effective solution for the rapid and accurate extraction of flood inundation areas, emphasizing the enhancement of extraction speed and dynamic monitoring throughout the flood event. The solution uses a normalized difference water index (NDWI), a refined threshold method, and a filtering process for microwave (radar) images. Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi-spectral Image) images served as the primary data sources. The Sentinel-2 images were preprocessed to extract pre-flood water bodies, while the Sentinel-1 SAR images were processed using the proposed filtering method to identify post-flood inundation areas. Results: The application and validation of this framework are demonstrated through the case of the 2020 flood event in Tongling, Anhui Province. The framework’s performance was validated through comparison with ground truth data, yielding high kappa accuracies of 98% for optical images and 89% for Synthetic Aperture Radar. The findings highlight the framework’s ability to capture high-accuracy changes in flood inundation areas and to characterize the dynamic process of flood inundation area changes. Discussion: This study contributes to the field by enhancing the extraction speed and scope of water bodies from SAR images and improving the quality of microwave remote sensing data processing. It offers valuable insights for emergency rapid response and situational awareness in the context of extreme weather events and associated flood disasters. © © 2024 Teng, Luo, Li, Xing, Shao, Wang and Wang.","flood; inundation extraction; remote sensing images; sentinel-1 SAR images; sentinel-2 MSI images; tongling","data processing; disaster management; extreme event; flood damage; microwave imagery; multispectral image; remote sensing; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; Anhui; China; Tongling","","","","","(202203AC100001)","The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

However, the traditional fire detection system is often based on centralized data processing and decision making, which is easy to be affected by single point of failure and communication delay. In this paper, a wheeled robot system for fire situational awareness based on federated learning is proposed to improve the efficiency and reliability of fire detection and emergency response. The system consists of IoT systems in smart cities and wheeled robots that detect anomalies in the environment in real time through collaborative learning and autonomous movement of robots. In terms of robot architecture, we have adopted an innovative design scheme combining five-bar linkage legs structure and dual-wheel foot structure, so that the robot can walk freely in complex terrain, such as corridors and steps. The experiment shows that FSAR system has good performance in fire target detection, which is similar to the performance of centralized learning. Moreover, in the real world, the actual performance of the robot is consistent with the simulation results, and the robot can ensure the stability of the attitude under the condition of acceleration. © 2024 IEEE.","circuit board design; dual-wheeled robot; federated learning; situation awareness","Adversarial machine learning; Collaborative robots; Fire alarm systems; Fire detectors; Industrial robots; Integrated circuit design; Intelligent robots; Machine learning; Microrobots; Network security; Robot learning; Board design; Centralised; Circuit board design; Circuit boards; Dual-wheeled robot; Performance; Robots system; Situation awareness; Situational awareness; Wheeled robot; Federated learning","","","","","","","Xu, Hanyue, Decentralized and Distributed Learning for AIoT: A Comprehensive Review, Emerging Challenges, and Opportunities, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 101016-101052, (2024); Hu, Guoqiang, Cloud robotics: Architecture, challenges and applications, IEEE Network, 26, 3, pp. 21-28, (2012); Rezaeifam, Sanam, Fire emergency response systems information requirements' data model for situational awareness of responders: A goal-directed task analysis, Journal of Building Engineering, 63, (2023); Arxiv, (2024); Wang, Chien Yao, CSPNet: A new backbone that can enhance learning capability of CNN, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2020-June, pp. 1571-1580, (2020); Xu, Hanyue, Multi-Level Split Federated Learning for Large-Scale AIoT System Based on Smart Cities, Future Internet, 16, 3, (2024); McMahan, H.

Corbin was a Revolutionary War heroine who spent her final years following the war living in the Village of Highland Falls, NY. After learning the remains previously interred at the United States Military Academy Cemetery at West Point in 1926 were not the remains of Margaret Corbin, but in fact an unknown male, we felt compelled to rediscover Corbin's true interment site. After reviewing two volumes of 1926 Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) firsthand accounts and research from the United States Military Academy Library Archives, we identified a potential research area on a land parcel previously owned by J.P. Morgan. Using the LMX200, three sites were explored with a total of six-line scans covering approximately 600ft. The EKKO_Project v6 software was used to process the collected data with a combination of default and manual program settings to further interpret the data. Thus, allowing us to identify several structural anomalies that are consistent in depth with historical burial sites especially when taking nearly 225 years' worth of erosion, flooding, and land use changes into account. However, to more conclusively confirm our results further testing of the site must be completed in the form of soil sampling to test for organic matter, an Electromagnetic survey and/or a resistivity survey to further corroborate our GPR findings. © 2024 IEEE.","Captain Molly; DAR; Daughters of the American Revolution; Geoarchaeology; Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR); Historical archaeology; Margaret Corbin; Molly Corbin; Near Surface Geophysics; Remote Sensing; Revolutionary War","Antenna grounds; Biographies; Economic geology; Electromagnetic prospecting; Geological surveys; Magnetic prospecting; Military data processing; Military mapping; Seismic prospecting; Soil surveys; Soil testing; Captain molly; Daughter of the american revolution; Geoarcheology; Ground Penetrating Radar; Historical archeology; Margaret corbin; Molly corbin; Near-surface geophysics; Remote-sensing; Revolutionary war; Ground penetrating radar systems","","","","","","Special thanks to LTC (Ret) Jennifer Voigtschild (West Point s Command Historian), Ronnie Coffee (Village of Highland Falls Historian), and Mr. John Willis for the 1891 Putnam County land parcel map from his personal collection used to reference our potential burial site location to previous historical land plots owned by J.P.

For high-cost military systems, standard signal processing techniques can be used by tracking systems, however, low-cost systems require simpler approaches. We developed a fast detector-agnostic tracker for improving situational awareness using electro-optical video data. Our approach uses low computational techniques such as YOLO, match filters, and shape transforms to segment objects of interest in an image. From two or more successive detections, we initialize an alpha-beta filter that predicts the location of the target of interest in the image. Next, we segment subsequent frames to a search area around the predicted region. This increases the sensitivity of the detector by improving the average signal-to-noise ratio and it also decreases the false alarm rate. The reduction in the size of the processing area can improve the detection speed per frame by an order of magnitude relative to a full-sized frame. By using algorithms with input from variable-size object a such as YOLO, this algorithm can be adapted to track virtually any object captured in a video. © 2024 SPIE.","Alpha-Beta Filter; Classification; Detection; Electro-optical; Hough Transform; Image Processing; Low Resolution; Tracking; YOLO","Image enhancement; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Military data processing; Military mapping; Remote sensing; Video recording; Wiener filtering; Alpha-beta filter; Detection; Electro-optical; Image object recognition; Images processing; Low resolution images; Lower resolution; Object Tracking; Tracking; YOLO; Hough transforms","","","","","DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, DEVCOM ARL","This research was funded by DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory.

It is in high demand for many applications like 3D site documentation, military applications, wind turbine site evaluation, and solar plant planning. LiDAR data is employed to study the solar plant’s feasibility in selecting the optimum location, power budget, azimuth and tilt angles, and the best solar panel orientations. The cloud points are collected and used to construct an LAZ file for the targeted location in Baghdad, Iraq. The abbreviation LAZ stands for LASzip, which is a compressed version of the LAS (LIDAR Aerial Survey) file format. LAZ files store LiDAR data and are commonly used for compressing significant cloud points files to 90% smaller than LAS files while retaining all the original data. Furthermore, the compression algorithm is lossless, meaning there is no data loss during the compression process. The LAZ file contains information about the site and the solar radiation around one year.

Among the available methods, radar remote sensing is increasingly used due to its advantages of being rarely affected by cloud cover and allowing image acquisition during both day and night. The growing availability over the past decade of free synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, such as Sentinel-1 images, enabled the widespread use of C-band images for ship detection. There is, however, a broad range of SAR data processing methods proposed in the literature, challenging the selection of the most appropriate one for a given application. Here, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on ship detection methods using C-band SAR data from 2015 to 2022. The review shows a partition between traditional and deep learning (DL) methods. Earlier methods were mainly based on constant false alarm rate or polarimetry, which require limited computing resources but critically depend on ships' physical environment. Those approaches are gradually replaced by DL, due to the growth of computing capacities, the wide availability of SAR images, and the publication of DL training datasets. However, access to these computing capacities may not be easy for all users, which could become a major obstacle to their development. While both methods have the same objective, they differ both technically and in their approaches to the problem. Traditional methods mainly focus on ship size in spatial units (meters), whereas DL methods are mainly based on the number of ship pixels, regardless of image resolution. These latter methods can result in a lack of information on ship size and, therefore, a lack of knowledge that could be useful to specific applications, such as fisheries and protected area management. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Maritime domain awareness; remote sensing; small ship; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); vessel detection","Conservation; Data handling; Deep learning; Ellipsometry; Environmental protection; Fisheries; Image resolution; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Search engines; Ships; Tracking radar; C-bands; Marine vehicles; Maritime domain awareness; Radar polarimetry; Remote-sensing; Ship detection; Small ship; Synthetic aperture radar; Vessel detection; data set; detection method; image analysis; literature review; radar imagery; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; ship technology; synthetic aperture radar; vessel","","","","","(21019812)","Funding text 1: The authors thank the R\u00E9gion Occitanie, France (project #21019812, Recherche et Soci\u00E9t\u00E9s -2021), for funding this work under the project DECOSAR.; Funding text 2: This paragraph of the first footnote will contain the date on which you submitted your paper for review, which is populated by IEEE.

Among neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning offer numerous advanced algorithms for object detection in remote sensing imagery, which is pivotal in military and civilian contexts. CNNs excel in extracting features from training samples. However, traditional CNN models often lack specific signal assumptions tailored to remote sensing data at the feature level. In this paper, we propose a novel approach aimed at effectively representing and correlating information within CNNs for remote sensing object detection. We introduce object tokens and incorporate global information features in embedding layers, facilitating the comprehensive utilization of features across multiple hierarchical levels. Consideration of feature maps from images as two-dimensional signals, matrix image signal processing is employed to correlate features for diverse representations within the CNN framework. Moreover, hierarchical feature signals are effectively represented and associated during end-to-end network training. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that the CNN model incorporating feature representation and association outperforms CNN models lacking these elements in object detection from remote sensing images. Additionally, integrating image signal processing enhances efficiency in end-to-end network training. Various signal processing approaches increase the process ability of the network, and the methodology could be transferred to other specific and well-defined task. © © 2024 Rao, Wu, Li, Zhang, Bao and Peng.","convolutional neural networks; dynamic association; feature mining; object detection; remote sensing imagery","algorithm; artificial neural network; data mining; data set; remote sensing; signal processing","","","","","","","Ahmed, Mohammed Altaf, Fuzzy wavelet neural network driven vehicle detection on remote sensing imagery, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 109, (2023); al-Badri, Ahmed Husham, Classification of weed using machine learning techniques: a review—challenges, current and future potential techniques, Journal of Plant Diseases and Protection, 129, 4, pp. 745-768, (2022); Aldea, Emanuel, Robust crack detection for unmanned aerial vehicles inspection in an a-contrario decision framework, Journal of Electronic Imaging, 24, 6, (2015); Ayesha, Bibi Erum, Ship Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery for Arbitrarily Oriented Object Detection, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 782 LNNS, pp. 457-466, (2023); Carion, Nicolas, End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 12346 LNCS, pp. 213-229, (2020); Chen, Chihau, On the roles of advanced signal processing in remotely sensing, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 7477, (2009); Cheng, Gong, Automatic landslide detection from remote-sensing imagery using a scene classification method based on boVW and pLSA, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 34, 1, pp. 45-59, (2013); Cheng, Gong, Effective and Efficient Midlevel Visual Elements-Oriented Land-Use Classification Using VHR Remote Sensing Images, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 53, 8, pp. 4238-4249, (2015); Cheng, Gong, A survey on object detection in optical remote sensing images, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 117, pp. 11-28, (2016); Cheng, Gong, Multi-class geospatial object detection and geographic image classification based on collection of part detectors, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 98, pp. 119-132, (2014)","Z.

Building a high-fidelity digital model of the land surface environment in real time is the key foundation for realizing the virtual mapping of the geographic environment and then forming a digital twin geographic environment. However, current methods for constructing these models suffer from several challenges such as slow speed, low timeliness, and limited application in large scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a new real-time dense point cloud generation and digital model construction method based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. The proposed algorithm remarkably improves the speed and accuracy of land surface model construction compared with existing algorithms and improves the degree of online data collection and real-time modeling. The algorithm is based on a general simultaneous localization and mapping framework. The technical chain from data acquisition, data processing, feature extraction and matching to 3D point cloud generation, digital model reconstruction, and result analysis is unobstructed. The algorithm breaks through the key technologies in scene reconstruction such as online data acquisition and pose problem solving, real-time dense point cloud generation, digital surface model, and digital orthophoto map construction. According to the experimental results of the dataset containing different land surface environments such as cities, farmland, mountains, and deserts, the algorithm proposed in this paper can process high-quality land surface environment dense point clouds and digital models while being 30—50 times faster than existing algorithms such as Pix4DMapper. On average, it can process a high-resolution image in less than 1 second, whereas the interval for general aerial survey drones is 1—2 seconds. Furthermore, the application of the algorithm proposed in this paper to emergency rescue work of mountain flood disasters can assist in the real-time reconstruction of inaccessible areas, survey the area and location of washed-out and sediment areas, and support emergency rescue work. The proposed real-time dense point cloud generation and digital model construction method based on UAV platforms represents a considerable advancement in the field of geographic information systems. It can revolutionize various geographic fields, including disaster warning and management, emergency response, military applications, and agricultural and urban planning. Additionally, due to the breakthrough of the algorithm, it solves the core problem of real-time mapping from reality to virtual in the construction of digital twins in geographic environments. Therefore, it can empower digital twins and provide a digital foundation for digital twin applications in geographic environments.

It has the advantages of a small size, light weight, high gain, low noise, and fast response. Therefore, it has wide application prospects in military equipment, astronomical observation, remote-sensing mapping, and space detection. In the EBCMOS working process, the photoelectrons generated from the photocathode by the external photoelectric effect are accelerated by the negative high voltage between the photocathode and the surface of the electron-sensitive CMOS and bombard the P-type semiconductor substrate to obtain the gain from the secondary electrons in the multiplier layer. Because of the concentration difference of the minority carriers in the P-type substrate, the secondary electrons diffuse to the pixel region, are collected by the photodiode in the active pixel circuit, and are finally read out by the MOS transistor amplification circuit. Therefore, to improve the gain characteristics of EBCMOS devices, the design and optimization of the structural parameters of EBCMOS substrates and the building of corresponding theoretical models are important issues for researchers. In this study, secondary electron charge collection in EBCMOS substrates under different doping modes and structural parameters was investigated, laying a theoretical and technical foundation for the preparation of high-gain EBCMOS electron multiplier layers. Methods According to carrier transport theory and the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, a theoretical model of the entire electronic trajectory of an EBCMOS substrate was established. Electron charge collection in the electron multiplier layer under uniform and gradient doping of the P-type substrate was simulated, and transport calculation models of photogenerated electrons and multiplier electrons in the proximity region of the EBCMOS were established. Various EBCMOS structural models were designed to simulate the electronic motions under the condition of different doping concentrations, substrate thicknesses, proximity distances, and gradient doping structures, and the influence of different structural parameters on the electron charge collection of the electronic multiplier layer was analyzed. Results and Discussions For a uniformly doped substrate, with an increase in doping concentration, the recombination rate of the carrier increases, the lifetime of minority carriers decreases, and the number of secondary electrons collected in the pixel region decreases, which causes the charge collection efficiency to decrease continuously (Fig. 4). When the substrate doping concentration reaches 1019 cm−3, the charge collection efficiency approaches 0—that is, the secondary electrons are completely recombined. As the thickness of the substrate increases, the diffusion range of the secondary electrons increases (Fig. 5), and the scattering radius of the secondary electrons collected in the pixel region increases, which is not conducive to improving the charge collection efficiency (Fig. 6). Therefore, a thinner P-type substrate treatment is necessary to obtain a higher charge collection efficiency. As the proximity distance between the cathode surface and the EBCMOS substrate increases, the initial energy obtained by the incident electrons decreases, and the number of secondary electrons that generate multiplication decreases, thereby reducing the number of electrons collected in the pixel area and reducing the charge collection efficiency (Fig. 8). When the substrate is divided into two sections for gradient doping, the range of secondary electron diffusion in the diffusion and depletion regions is obviously reduced, indicating that the electron focusing effect of gradient doping is better than that of uniform doping (Fig. 10). The built-in electric field distribution generated by gradient doping can provide an additional drift speed for secondary electrons in the direction of their movement, shortening the diffusion time of electrons in the diffusion region and obtaining a higher charge collection efficiency. The charge collection efficiency can reach a maximum of 86.28% when the width of the surface heavily doped region is 2 μm. Conclusions Based on the carrier transport mechanism in semiconductor physics and the Monte Carlo algorithm, the electronic trajectory of incident optoelectrons in EBCMOS is theoretically simulated. The electronic trajectory in the device is determined based on the simulation results, and the factors affecting the efficiency of charge collection are analyzed. The results show that the charge collection efficiency of the EBCMOS increases with the decreases in substrate doping concentration, substrate thickness, and proximity distance. The gradient doping of the substrate clearly improves the charge collection efficiency. The optimized gradient doping structure model achieves a charge collection efficiency of 86.28%. The results provide theoretical support for the fabrication of high-gain EBCMOS devices. © 2024 Science Press.

Although robotic technologies are growing, achieving fully autonomous operation is still challenging in the construction workplace. Construction tasks include complex and unstructured activities and face challenges and harsh conditions in work environments. Since fully autonomous systems are not yet feasible, human-in-the-loop teleoperation systems are a more attainable intermediate solution. Although the Deep Space Network (DSN) system allows for transmitting and receiving signals for interplanetary communications, the data processing and signal transmission delays under the DSN system are inevitable due to the long distances. These time delays affect robust control, situational awareness, and the sense of presence. However, experimental teleoperation tasks have not been conducted enough in extraterrestrial terrain and construction contexts. To fill the knowledge gap, this study aims to evaluate the impact of time delay and low-quality display on task performance, situational awareness through eye movements, and telepresence experiences during construction tasks on the lunar surface. Our experimental study was conducted to enhance the understanding of time delay conditions in space network systems and to support future development of construction teleoperation systems’ interfaces. This research will contribute to the engineering system design for space construction teleoperation. © ASCE.","","Delay control systems; Interplanetary flight; Lunar missions; Planets; Remote control; Robotics; Space research; Time delay; Visual communication; Deep space networks; Living spaces; Low qualities; Lunar construction; Network systems; Performance; Situational awareness; Teleoperation systems; Time delayed; Time-delays; Construction; Eye movements","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2221436)","This material is in part based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Award #2221436.

We propose utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze extensive datasets, as modern military operations rely on accurate spatial terrain mapping for command, control, communication, and coordination. This study introduces a terrain analysis approach tailored to military vehicle movement, focusing on assessing ground resilience to vehicle traffic and predicting terrain trafficability for optimal route planning. For this analysis, we calculated effective movement zones between designated points, factoring in landscape, terrain relief, and soil conditions. Movement routes were strategically planned, incorporating both potential obstacles and forecasted trafficability. GIS was employed to generate maps showing equipment reach within specific timeframes and to document optimized routes. This method provides a predictive assessment of soil trafficability, enabling precise route calculation for military vehicles across various operational settings within designated areas. © 2024 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

However, designing high-performance and high-reliability SAR imaging systems that operate in harsh environmental conditions while adhering to strict size, weight, and power consumption constraints remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a spaceborne SAR imaging chip based on a SoC architecture with system fault-tolerant technology. The fault-tolerant SAR SoC architecture has a CPU, interface subsystem, memory subsystem, data transit subsystem, and data processing subsystem. The data processing subsystem, which includes fast Fourier transform (FFT) modules, coordinated rotation digital computer (CORDIC) modules (for phase factor calculation), and complex multiplication modules, is the most critical component and can achieve various modes of SAR imaging. Through analyzing the computational requirements of various modes of SAR, we found that FFT accounted for over 50% of the total computational workload in SAR imaging processing, while the CORDIC modules for phase factor generation accounted for around 30%. Therefore, ensuring the fault tolerance of these two modules is crucial. To address this issue, we propose a word-length optimization redundancy (WLOR) method to make the fixed-point pipelined FFT processors in FFT modules fault tolerant. Additionally, we propose a fault-tolerant pipeline CORDIC architecture utilizing error correction code (ECC) and sum of squares (SOS) check. For other parts of the SoC architecture, we propose a generic partial triple modular redundancy (TMR) hardening method based on the HITS algorithm to improve fault tolerance. Finally, we developed a fully automated FPGA-based fault injection platform to test the design’s effectiveness by injecting errors at arbitrary locations. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improved the chip’s fault tolerance, making the SAR imaging chip safer and more reliable. We also implemented a prototype measurement system with a chip-included board and demonstrated the proposed design’s performance on the Chinese Gaofen-3 strip-map continuous imaging system. The chip requires 9.2 s, 50.6 s, and 7.4 s for a strip-map with 16,384 × 16,384 granularity, multi-channel strip-map with 65,536 × 8192 granularity, and multi-channel scan mode with 32,768 × 4096 granularity, respectively, and the system hardware consumes 6.9 W of power to process the SAR raw data. © 2023 by the authors.","fault tolerant; real-time processing; spaceborne; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Complex networks; Continuous time systems; Data handling; Digital computers; Error correction; Fast Fourier transforms; Fault tolerance; Fourier series; Integrated circuit design; Memory architecture; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Programmable logic controllers; Real time systems; Redundancy; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; System-on-chip; Fault tolerant technologies; Fault-tolerant; Imaging chips; Realtime processing; Space-borne; Spaceborne synthetic aperture radars; Synthetic aperture radar imaging; System faults; System-on-chip architecture; Radar imaging","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFB3902304); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key R & D Program of China under contract 2022YFB3902304.","Synthetic Aperture Radar Processing, (1999); Lou, Yunling, Onboard Radar Processor Development for Rapid Response to Natural Hazards, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 9, 6, pp. 2770-2776, (2016); Hirose, Akira, Foreword to the Special Issue on Advances in SAR and Radar Technology, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 8, 8, pp. 3748-3750, (2015); Gierull, Christoph H., Foreword to the Special Issue on Multichannel Space-Based SAR, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 8, 11, pp. 4995-4997, (2015); Tralli, David M., Satellite remote sensing of earthquake, volcano, flood, landslide and coastal inundation hazards, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 59, 4, pp. 185-198, (2005); Percivall, George S., Improving disaster management using earth observations-GEOSS and CEOS activities, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 6, 3, pp. 1368-1375, (2013); Joyce, Karen E., A review of the status of satellite remote sensing and image processing techniques for mapping natural hazards and disasters, Progress in Physical Geography, 33, 2, pp. 183-207, (2009); Xu, Gang, Sparse Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging From Compressed Sensing and Machine Learning: Theories, applications, and trends, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine, 10, 4, pp. 32-69, (2022); Zhang, Bangjie, Multi-Channel Back-Projection Algorithm for mmWave Automotive MIMO SAR Imaging With Doppler-Division Multiplexing, IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing, 17, 2, pp. 445-457, (2023); undefined","Y.

Knowing the material composition of the resident space object can be of value in object identification and risk assessment using remote sensing techniques. To perform this task, it is increasingly imperative to optically characterize spacecraft materials to identify unique material-specific spectroscopic markers. In this work, a variety of materials frequently utilized by the aerospace industry in spacecraft design and construction were analyzed using reflectance spectroscopy. The collected data provide a spectral characterization baseline for modern-day and historical spacecraft materials. The color index was computed for standard astronomical and suggested theoretical filter passbands and compared to each other in their capability to discriminate materials belonging to different classes. The color index was calculated from reflectance spectra of common spacecraft materials in their pristine, as-received conditions that fell under different family groupings. Different color-index combinations were studied using color-color diagrams. Visual and quantitative analysis of the color-color diagrams were used to evaluate the possibility of discriminating materials from one another by means of optical measurements. Results of the analysis show that polyimide and photovoltaic materials are most easy to discriminate from all other materials via color indices using different filter passbands evaluated in this study. © 2023, The Author(s).","Band selection; Color index; Optical characterization; Remote sensing; Space situational awareness; Spacecraft materials; Spectral reflectance","Color; Earth (planet); Optical data processing; Optical remote sensing; Orbits; Reflection; Risk assessment; Space flight; Space optics; Spacecraft; Bands selections; Color index; Color-color diagrams; Material discrimination; Optical characterization; Pass bands; Remote-sensing; Space situational awareness; Spacecraft materials; Spectral reflectances; Aerospace industry","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC18K1702); Johnson Space Center, JSC; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL; University of Texas at El Paso, UTEP; Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, USD(R&E), (W911NF-19-1-0011)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge NASA Johnson Space Center’s Orbital Debris Program Office for providing required capabilities for performing reflectance spectroscopic measurements in optimal conditions.

However, due to the high cost of spectral imaging equipment and complex data processing, spectral images are mainly applied in remote sensing, military and other fields. In recent years, scholars have proposed solutions to reconstruct spectral images by mathematical methods using RGB images, which can greatly improve the application range of spectral images. However, there are many problems in current spectral reconstruction models, such as the loss of image details and insufficient spectral accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a spectral reconstruction method from RGB images based on a dual attention mechanism to improve the quality of spectral image reconstruction from image detail and spectral accuracy. The proposed spectral reconstruction method designs a sparse signal depth reconstruction network, focusing on the sparse characteristics of RGB images, and achieves sparse to complete signals reconstruction by accurately extracting multilevel features of image information and mining more semantic information. Regarding network structure, the designed spectral reconstruction network first uses small parameter convolution to extract shallow feature information of RGB images. Then, the effective multi-frequency channel attention mechanism was used to calculate the correlation between each channel in the feature layer, and the effective distribution of feature response was realized by inter-layer weighting. At the same time, the layer feature weighted fusion attention mechanism is introduced to learn the dependence between features of different layers, and the weights are optimized through different layers' weighting to extract effective spectral depth features. Finally, based on the extracted depth features, the hyperspectral image is transformed into a specified dimension by convolution. The experiment uses the python 3.7 programming language, pytorch 1.2, as the deep learning model framework and combined spectral image error and RGB image error as loss functions for the training of the spectral reconstruction network. The proposed method and 7 mainstream spectral reconstruction methods are compared and verified on the NTIRE 2020 and CAVE datasets. From a subjective perspective, the spectral image details recovered by this method are clearer, and the error is smaller. From the perspective of objective indicators, the spectral images reconstructed by this method are reduced by 18.9%, 16.6%, and 22.2% in R<inf>RMSE</inf>, R<inf>SAM</inf> and R<inf>ERGAS</inf> indicators, respectively, compared with the methods with better reconstruction performance in the existing literature. The R<inf>PSNR</inf> indicator improved by 4.5%. Therefore, the experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method from RGB image spectral reconstruction. © 2023 Science Press.

While the AHRSS captures more detailed information from the terrain objects, the computational complexity of data processing is greatly increased. As an important application technology in the hyperspectral domain, anomaly detection (AD) processing must be real-time and high-precision in many cases, such as post-disaster rescue, military battlefield search, and natural disaster detection. In this paper, the real-time AD technology for the push-broom AHRSS is studied, the mathematical model is established, and a novel implementation framework is proposed. Firstly, the optimized kernel minimum noise fraction (OP-KMNF) transformation is employed to extract informative and discriminative features between the background and anomalies. Secondly, the Nyström method is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of OP-KMNF transformation by decomposing and extrapolating the sub-kernel matrix to estimate the eigenvector of the entire kernel matrix. Thirdly, the extracted features are transferred to hard disks for data storage. Then, taking the extracted features as input data, the background separation model-based CEM anomaly detector (BSM-CEMAD) is imported to detect anomalies. Finally, graphics processing unit (GPU) parallel computing is utilized in the Nyström-based OP-KMNF (NOP-KMNF) transformation and the BSM-CEMAD to improve the execution efficiency, and the real-time AD for the push-broom AHRSS could be realized. To test the feasibility of the implementation framework proposed in this paper, the experiment is carried out with the Airborne Multi-Modular Imaging Spectrometer (AMMIS) developed by the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics as the data acquisition platform. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms many other state-of-the-art AD methods in anomalies detection and background suppression. Moreover, under the condition that the downlink data could retain most of the hyperspectral data information, the proposed method achieves real-time detection of pixel-level anomalies, with the initial delay not exceeding 1 s, the false alarm rate (FAR) less than 5%, and the true positive rate (TPR) close to 98%. © 2023 by the authors.","airborne hyperspectral remote sensing system (AHRSS); anomaly detection (AD); feature extraction; graphics processing unit (GPU); real-time processing","Anomaly detection; Computational complexity; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Data acquisition; Data handling; Digital storage; Extraction; Feature extraction; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Metadata; Program processors; Real time systems; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing; Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing system; Features extraction; Graphic processing unit; Hyperspectral remote sensing system; Minimum noise fraction; Real-time anomaly detections; Realtime processing; Graphics processing unit","","","","","(D040102)","This research was funded by National Civil Aerospace Project (No. D040102).","Shaw, Gary A., Signal processing for hyperspectral image exploitation, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 19, 1, pp. 12-16, (2002); Remote Sensing Models and Methods for Image Processing, (1997); Kennedy, Robert E., Remote sensing change detection tools for natural resource managers: Understanding concepts and tradeoffs in the design of landscape monitoring projects, Remote Sensing of Environment, 113, 7, pp. 1382-1396, (2009); Kerle, Norman, Satellite remote sensing as a tool in lahar disaster management, Disasters, 26, 2, pp. 140-160, (2002); Jensen, John Robert, Remote sensing of urban/suburb an infrastructure and socio-economic attributes, Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 65, 5, pp. 611-622, (1999); Masters Thesis, (2017); Masters Thesis, (2017); Mod Phys, (2015); Fu, Liting, Novel fast real-time target detection and classification algorithms for hyperspectral imagery, Guangxue Xuebao/Acta Optica Sinica, 37, 2, (2017); Su, Hongjun, Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection: A survey, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine, 10, 1, pp. 64-90, (2022)","Y.

Additionally, existing problems and future research prospects are analyzed and discussed herein. High-quality imaging through scattering media has crucial applications in biomedicine, astronomy, remote sensing, traffic safety, etc. Object photons traveling through a scattering medium can be classified as ballistic, snake, or diffusive photons based on the degree of deviation from their initial propagation directions. Ballistic photons can maintain their initial directions and retain undistorted object information. Using gated ballistic photons, optical coherence tomography, multiphoton microscopy, and confocal microscopy have been employed to successfully image objects hidden behind scattering media. However, in the presence of a strong scattering medium, all incident photons become diffusive after multiple scatterings and form a speckle pattern. Hence, the abovementioned techniques based on gated ballistic photons fail to image hidden objects. Therefore, the speckle imaging technology was developed to overcome this limitation. This technology involves three main steps: first, establishing a physical model of speckle formation; second, measuring and statistically analyzing the speckle light field; and finally, computationally reconstructing the hidden objects. An imaging system with high spatial and temporal resolution can obtain rich spatial and motion details of high-speed moving scenes. Improvement in spatial and temporal resolutions depends on hardware-performance improvement, including attaining high resolution and low noise in a detector array and satisfactory optical design. However, owing to the limitations in the development of semiconductors and manufacturing technologies, manufacturing a high-performance detector is difficult and costly. Additionally, the huge volume of data collected using an imaging system mandates strict requirements for read-out circuits and back-end data processing platforms. Moreover, miniaturization of the system becomes a general concern that conflicts with these high-performance requirements. Hence, further improvement in the performance of imaging systems cannot be realized based solely on hardware improvement. Compressive imaging is an imaging technology based on the compressed sensing principle and development in computer science, which realizes signal coding and compression simultaneously. Combined with back-end reconstruction algorithms, compressive imaging greatly improves the performance of an imaging system and is widely used in various imaging applications. Spectral imaging technology combines imaging and spectral technologies; thus, this technology can obtain the spatial and spectral information of an object simultaneously. Compared with traditional imaging technologies, the spectral imaging technology possesses a remarkable advantage of sensing information from a multidimensional optical field. By analyzing spectral images, highly detailed target information can be obtained, which is helpful for target recognition as well as substance detection and classification. With the development of compressed sensing theory, a new type of computational imaging technology termed as coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) was proposed. Subsequently, CASSI has become an advanced research topic in the field of imaging. CASSI integrates optical modulation, multiplexing detection, and numerical reconstruction algorithm to address the issues of imaging complex systems, low efficiency of data acquisition, and limited resolution in traditional snapshot spectral imaging technologies. In future, CASSI can play an important role in agriculture, military, biomedicine, and other fields, realizing fast and accurate spectral imaging approaches using intelligent perception capability. Progress The speckle correlation imaging method proposed by Bertolotti et al. introduced the concept of speckle imaging. They analyzed the autocorrelation of speckle images captured under different laser illumination angles and subsequently achieved noninvasive reconstruction of objects with phase retrieval. Katz et al. simplified the speckle imaging system using incoherent light illumination and then achieved reconstruction using a single speckle image. Since then, substantial progress has been observed in speckle imaging technology, pertaining to improving accuracy and scene applicability, expanding the imaging field of view and depth of field, and enhancing the ability of the technology to decode objects' optical field parameters, thus becoming a highly researched topic in computational imaging. This study introduces our primary research results regarding key technologies related to speckle imaging, including recursion- driven bispectral imaging with respect to dynamic scattering scenes, learning to image and track moving objects through scattering media via speckle difference, and imaging through scattering media under ambient- light interference. Developing high resolution detectors in the infrared band is considerably difficult compared with developing detectors in the visible band. Therefore, herein, we focused on studying compressive imaging in infrared band. The optical hardware systems and reconstruction algorithms related to spatial and temporal infrared compressive imaging are introduced and our related research is introduced in this study. We set up a mediumwave infraredblock compressive imaging system (Fig. 9) and discussed obtained results herein, including reducing block effect, removing stray light, limiting nonuniform (Fig. 10), improving real- time performance (Fig. 11). For the back- end processing of measured data, we reviewed the traditional methods and proposed several reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning in this study. With respect to spatial compressive imaging, we designed Meta- TR, which combined meta- attention and transformer (Fig. 12); furthermore, we designed a multiframe reconstruction network named Joinput- CiNet (Fig. 13). Moreover, we introduced a novel version of a 3D- TCI network to achieve temporal reconstruction (Fig. 14). Moreover, the spatial – temporal compressive imaging method, which combines temporal and spatial compression, is briefly discussed herein (Fig. 16). Furthermore, we reviewed relevant studies in the field of compressive computational spectral imaging that covered the development of color- coded aperture and use of the latest transformer network to improve the image- reconstruction quality. Additionally, we summarized our research achievements. First, we proposed an optical- axis- shift CASSI system based on a digital micromirror device, which can effectively suppress off- axis aberration (Fig. 17). Second, we proposed a 3D coded convolutional neural network capable of realizing hyperspectral image classification (Fig. 19) based on the established dual- disperser CASSI system (Fig. 18). Subsequently, we proposed a hexagonal, blue- noise, complementary-coded aperture (Fig. 20) and spatial- target adaptive- coded aperture (Fig. 21) for improving the perceptual efficiency of CASSI systems. Finally, to enhance the quality of reconstructed spectral images, we proposed a fast alternating minimization algorithm based on the sparsity and deep image priors (Fama- SDIP) (Fig. 22). Conclusions and Prospects We achieved remarkable results in three categories of computational imaging techniques based on multidimensional optical field manipulation: speckle imaging, spatial and temporal compressive imaging, and compressive computational spectral imaging. However, these techniques still face numerous challenges in terms of practical applications, including realizing a compact system design, mounting and error calibration, coded aperture preparation, fast and accurate reconstruction of optical fields, and lightweight design of networks. In future, researchers can combine the field of micro- /nano- optics with computational imaging mechanisms to further improve the manipulation ability of imaging systems. Moreover, artificial intelligence can be used to improve the scope of practical application of imaging systems. © 2023 Chinese Optical Society.

In the process of acquiring aerial remote sensing images, the optical system is defocused due to the influence of external environments such as ground elevation difference, temperature, and air pressure. The obtained aerial remote sensing images are not clear enough. The sharpness detection methods based on image processing complete the sharpness detection through the spectrum analysis of high-frequency information in aerial remote sensing images. Taking advantage of the fast running speed of computers, the sharpness detection of aerial remote sensing images is completed in real time. Therefore, it has become the main method of sharpness detection both in China and abroad. However, the weak characteristic areas such as oceans, grasslands, and deserts, which cover more than half of the earth, have less high-frequency information in aerial remote sensing images. When using conventional image methods for sharpness detection, the error rate is high. According to the characteristics of overlapping areas between the two images, a method of aerial camera image sharpness detection based on a digital elevation model (DEM) is proposed. This method introduces a high-precision DEM, and according to the acquired weak characteristic areas, the two images before and after the aerial remote image sensing feature overlapping areas. The aerial imaging model is modified by minimizing the re-projection error, and the sharpness is detected according to the offset of feature points in the weak characteristic overlapping areas. It makes up for the defect that the sharpness detection methods based on image processing can't detect the sharpness in weak characteristic areas and expands the applicability of the sharpness detection methods based on image processing. Methods In this study, an aerial imaging model and feature point matching are used to obtain image sharpness parameters. Firstly, a DEM is used to provide the elevation data of the ground object in the aerial imaging model. The sum of the re-projection error of each pixel in the overlapping areas is regarded as the re-projection error function. By minimizing the re-projection error, relative error coefficients of various influencing factors can be obtained, so as to modify the aerial imaging model. Then, according to the characteristics of the overlapping areas between the two images, the geographical information of sceneries in the overlapping areas is regarded as public knowledge. The modified aerial imaging model is used to realize the feature point matching algorithm. In addition, according to the error between the feature matching points and the scale-invariant feature transformation (SIFT) algorithm matching points, the change in the azimuth elements in the aerial camera is calculated. Finally, the change in the principal distance is used as the sharpness detection result. Through the focal plane driving device of the aerial camera, the focal plane of the aerial camera can be quickly adjusted to an appropriate position, so as to obtain aerial remote sensing images with sufficient sharpness. Results and Discussions In the experiment, aerial remote sensing images of the weak characteristic areas obtained by the aerial camera are transmitted to an image processing computer, and the DEM images with the accuracy of millimeter level processed by the computer in advance are introduced. SIFT algorithm is used to extract the features of the weak characteristic images in the overlapping areas, and the change in principal distance is calculated by the offset of feature points. Finally, the corresponding mechanical structure is adjusted according to the change in the principal distance, and aerial remote sensing images with sufficient sharpness are obtained. In this experiment, we select the second dimension with insufficient sharpness and the previous dimension with enough clear feature points in multiple groups of overlapping areas to verify the sharpness detection effect of the proposed algorithm between images with different sharpness (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). In areas with abundant ground sceneries, 15 repeated experiments are carried out using different sharpness detection algorithms. The root-mean-square error of the sharpness detection parameters of the algorithm in this paper reaches 15.8 μm (Table 1). After 15 repeated experiments in areas with scarce ground sceneries, the root-mean-square error of the sharpness detection parameters of proposed algorithm can reach 16. 3 μm. The classic sharpness detection algorithms such as Robert and proposed algorithm are used for weak characteristic areas, and 15 experiments are repeated. The sharpness detection curves are shown in Fig. 7. The root-mean-square error of sharpness detection parameters in the weak feature areas calculated by proposed algorithm can reach 16.275 μm (Table 2), and it meets the actual engineering accuracy requirements of aerial cameras. It is proved that proposed algorithm has a certain engineering application value. Conclusions In order to meet the application requirements of aerial cameras in military reconnaissance and topographic mapping, it is necessary to obtain clear aerial remote sensing images in real time. The key to obtaining a clear image is precise sharpness detection technology. In order to solve the problem of aerial camera imaging sharpness detection in weak characteristic areas, the characteristics of overlapping areas between the two images are analyzed, and a method of image sharpness detection of aerial cameras based on DEM is proposed. Based on DEM data, an aerial imaging model is optimized by minimizing the re-projection error. According to the geographical information of the sceneries in the overlapping areas of the aerial remote sensing images in the front and back formats, the change in the principal distance of the latter format relative to the previous format is calculated, so as to obtain the sharpness detection results. After many experiments, the root-mean-square error of sharpness measurement in areas with few features is 16.275 μm, which is within the range of half focal depth of an aerial camera optical system (19.2 μm). The accuracy meets the actual engineering accuracy requirements of aerial cameras, and the proposed algorithm has a certain engineering application value. © 2023 Chinese Optical Society.

One proposed improvement to MRS information gathering and operations is the use of swarms of autonomous surface, aerial, and/or undersea vehicles as a multi-agent system (MAS) to automate data collection, data processing, and situational awareness. Here, we explore the design of an autonomous multi-agent system with the objective of containing a target object, i.e., surrounding the object in a loosely defined shape. The agents make decisions using reinforcement learning by way of a Markov decision process. Our current roof-of-concepts are modeled using Python-based 2D simulation environments which containour agents and target used for prototyping and testing various reward functions.. However, we have built an infrastructure to port the simulation environments to Unreal Engine 4 for increased fidelity. In the current modeled scenario, each agent’s decisions are based on global positional knowledge of each entity in the environment. Future iterations are planned to feature agent decision making based on a high-fidelity communication protocol and inputs from integrated sensors. © 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA, All rights reserved.","","Antennas; Autonomous agents; Data acquisition; Data handling; Decision making; Engines; Markov processes; Multi agent systems; Oceanography; 'current; Autonomous swarms; Electrooptical sensors; Information operations; Maritime remote sensing; Multi-physics; Physical oceanography; Reinforcement learnings; Remote sensing information; Simulation environment; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Alkhateeb, Faisal, A multi agent-based system for securing university campus: Design and architecture, ISMS 2010 - UKSim/AMSS 1st International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation, pp. 75-79, (2010); Belkhala, Sofia, Smart parking architecture based on multi agent system, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 10, 3, pp. 378-382, (2019); Atınç, Gökhan M., A swarm-based approach to dynamic coverage control of multi-agent systems, Automatica, 112, (2020); Mora, Thierry, Local equilibrium in bird flocks, Nature Physics, 12, 12, pp. 1153-1157, (2016); Epic Games, (2019); Field and Service Robotics, (2017); Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2003); Artificial Intelligence Review, (2021); Chamoso, Pablo, Modeling Oil-Spill Detection with multirotor systems based on multi-agent systems, FUSION 2014 - 17th International Conference on Information Fusion, (2014); Xu, Fang, A hierarchical maritime target detection method for optical remote sensing imagery, Remote Sensing, 9, 3, (2017)","","","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA","","AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition, 2023","2023-01-23 through 2023-01-27","Orlando","313289","","9781624106996","","","English","AIAA SciTech Forum Expos.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198742815"

In response to this challenge, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can achieve high defect detection rates and efficient intelligent inspections. Although traditional manual patrols have been around for a long time, they require a lot of manpower due to natural obstacles. So, the attention to inspection automation is also increasing day by day. This project focuses on transmission line inspection, conducts in-depth research on it, analyzes its development bottlenecks, explores its key technologies, and provides theoretical basis and technical support for promoting transmission line inspection technology. Experiments have shown that under different wind conditions, the trajectory of UAVs can be greatly affected. Therefore, the influence of wind must be considered in UAV cruise trajectory planning. © 2023 IEEE.","Data processing; Intelligent patrol inspection; Transmission line; UAV","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Data handling; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Inspection; Military vehicles; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle transmissions; Aerial vehicle; Complex terrains; Construction scale; Harsh environment; Intelligent patrol inspection; Intelligent patrols; Line inspections; Power networks; Transmission-line; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Electric lines","","","","","","","Gao, Jingliang, Innovative Water Supply Network Pressure Management Method—The Establishment and Application of the Intelligent Pressure-Regulating Vehicle, Energies, 15, 5, (2022); Lv, Xiaojing, Application and Research of the Intelligent Management System Based on Internet of Things Technology in the Era of Big Data, Mobile Information Systems, 2021, (2021); Hua, Meng, UAV-Assisted Intelligent Reflecting Surface Symbiotic Radio System, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 20, 9, pp. 5769-5785, (2021); Li, Hongjun, Robust motion control for multi-split transmission line four-wheel driven mobile operation robot in extreme power environment, Industrial Robot, 47, 2, pp. 219-229, (2020); Zhen, Ziyang, Distributed intelligent self-organized mission planning of multi-UAV for dynamic targets cooperative search-attack, Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, 32, 12, pp. 2706-2716, (2019); Khan, Muhammad Asghar, A Dual-Mode Medium Access Control Mechanism for UAV-Enabled Intelligent Transportation System, Mobile Information Systems, 2021, (2021); Electrical Technology, (2017); Zhan, Yilong, Biological control technology and application based on agricultural unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) intelligent delivery of insect natural enemies (Trichogramma) carrier, Pest Management Science, 77, 7, pp. 3259-3272, (2021); Yue, Guang, Intelligent Inspection of Marine Disasters Based on UAV Intelligent Vision, Journal of Coastal Research, 93, sp1, pp. 410-416, (2019); Diab, Hatem Yassin, A multi‐objective optimal power flow control of electrical transmission networks using intelligent meta‐heuristic optimization techniques, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 9, (2021)","W.

Targets generally comprise various object categories with complex features and of varying sizes. Target detection is often used in complex application scenarios in which accurately and efficiently acquiring detection results can be challenging. The development of advanced target detection approaches is becoming increasingly necessary in both military and civilian fields. This article proposes an alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)-based parallel approach for hyperspectral target detection. Different from existing methods performing target detection solely on HSIs, our approach performs the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral data to leverage both spectral and spatial information prior. For each task or data partition, the parallel processing of the computation load on multiple computing nodes can substantially reduce the computation time. In addition, we introduce a novel weighted ADMM, which takes the influence of different variables on convergence into account, to further enhance the computational efficiency of the target detection model. Experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed parallel method not only produces more accurate detection results than direct detection methods, but also achieves significant acceleration ratio compared with the serial processing flow. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM); fusion; hyperspectral image (HSI); parallel; target detection","Acceleration; Computational efficiency; Data handling; Deep learning; Hyperspectral imaging; Learning algorithms; Object detection; Object recognition; Remote sensing; Target tracking; Alternating directions method of multipliers; Computational modelling; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral image; Images reconstruction; Machine learning algorithms; Objects detection; Parallel; Targets detection; Task analysis; Image reconstruction; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data processing; data set; detection method; efficiency measurement; experimental study; remote sensing; spectral resolution","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20191409, BK20180018, BK20211570); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62071233, 61971223, 61976117); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (30919011402, 30921011209, 30919011103, 30917015104, JSGP202204); (19KJA360001); European Commission, EC, (202204)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation ofChina underGrant 62071233, Grant 61971223, andGrant 61976117, in part by the Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation ofChina under Grant BK20211570, Grant BK20180018, and Grant BK20191409, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 30917015104, Grant 30919011103, Grant 30919011402, Grant 30921011209, and Grant JSGP202204, and in part by the Key Projects of University Natural Science Fund of Jiangsu Province under Grant 19KJA360001","Zhang, Lefei, Artificial Intelligence for Remote Sensing Data Analysis: A review of challenges and opportunities, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine, 10, 2, pp. 270-294, (2022); A, Nisha, Current Advances in Hyperspectral Remote Sensing in Urban Planning, Proceedings of the 2022 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Instrumentation and Control Technologies: Computational Intelligence for Smart Systems, ICICICT 2022, pp. 94-98, (2022); Zhu, Dehui, Target Dictionary Construction-Based Sparse Representation Hyperspectral Target Detection Methods, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 12, 4, pp. 1254-1264, (2019); Du, Qian, A signal-decomposed and interference-annihilated approach to hyperspectral target detection, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 42, 4, pp. 892-906, (2004); Zhang, Yuxiang, Multitask learning-based reliability analysis for hyperspectral target detection, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 12, 7, pp. 2135-2147, (2019); J Appl Remote Sens, (2014); Hong, Danfeng, Revisiting Graph Convolutional Networks with Mini-Batch Sampling for Hyperspectral Image Classification, Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing, Evolution in Remote Sensing, 2021-March, (2021); Manolakis, Dimitris G., Detection algorithms for hyperspectral imaging applications, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 19, 1, pp. 29-43, (2002); Proc 5th Symp Novel Optoelectron Detection Technol Appl, (2019); Li, Wei, Combined sparse and collaborative representation for hyperspectral target detection, Pattern Recognition, 48, 12, pp. 3904-3916, (2015)","Z.

Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant improvements in semantic segmentation, the challenges of efficient feature extraction, representation, fusion, and information transmission remain unsolved, which especially impacts the segmentation effectiveness of existing CNN-based models in extracting irregular and refined sea-land boundaries. In this article, a novel dual-branch ensemble network (DBENet) is proposed for pixel-level sea-land segmentation. The salient properties of the DBENet are: 1) a novel dual-branch network architecture is developed to achieve sufficient feature extraction and representation and 2) an efficient ensemble attention learning strategy suitable for the DBENet is designed to strengthen the correlation between dual branches to further facilitate feature fusion and information transmission. The comparative study with state-of-the-art methods reveals the superior performance of our approach, and the ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of each component in the proposed network.

In order to ensure reliable and stable operation of UGVs on unstructured terrain, it is necessary to identify the current road terrain and perform vehicle stability adjustment. Road terrain identification is a prerequisite for stability control. Most of the existing road terrain identification methods use a single vehicle sensor, which has the problem that complex algorithms need to be applied for data processing, which reduces the real-time performance. Moreover, the single sensor is weak in anti-interference and limited in recognizing the road. To address these problems, a method is proposed to collect vehicle motion data using on-board gyroscope sensors and velocity sensors. Back propagation (BP) neural network is used to identify the category of the road. For the problem that the conventional proportional-integral differential (PID) algorithm cannot be adapted to different road stability control, a multi-loop adaptive proportional-integral differential (PID) control system with the velocity loop as the outer loop and the torque (current) loop as the inner loop is proposed. In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, experiments are conducted on a UGV using robot operating system (ROS), and the results verify the feasibility and superiority of the road identification and stability control method proposed in this paper. It provides a good theoretical basis and valuable technical guidance for the UGV operation and control on unstructured roads. © 2013 IEEE.","Adaptive algorithms; BP neural networks; complex terrain; multi-loop PID control systems; road identification","Adaptive algorithms; Adaptive control systems; Data handling; Feature extraction; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Interactive computer systems; Landforms; Neural networks; Proportional control systems; Roads and streets; Stability; Three term control systems; Autonomous Vehicles; Back-propagation neural networks; Complex terrains; Features extraction; Multi-loop proportional-integral differential control system; Multiloop; Neural-networks; PD control; Proportional integral differential control; Real - Time system; Road; Roads identifications; Stability analyze; Real time systems","","","","","","","Whitson, Jordan A., Military Unmanned Ground Vehicle Maneuver: A Review and Formulation, SAE Technical Papers, (2023); China Navigat, (2015); Elect Technol, (2022); Peng, Jiegang, A biomimetic very low frequency (VLF) active electrolocation system based on FFT feature extraction localization algorithm, Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 52, 2, pp. 157-165, (2016); Benoit, Anne Marie, A GUIDE TO ALGORITHM DESIGN: Paradigms, Methods, and Complexity Analysis, A Guide to Algorithm Design: Paradigms, Methods, and Complexity Analysis, pp. 1-363, (2013); Canal, Ivan Paulo, Ziegler–Nichols Customization for Quadrotor Attitude Control under Empty and Full Loading Conditions, CMES - Computer Modeling in Engineering and Sciences, 125, 1, pp. 65-75, (2020); Kim, Jeongeun, Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture: A review of perspective of platform, control, and applications, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 105100-105115, (2019); Boursianis, Achilles D., Internet of Things (IoT) and Agricultural Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in smart farming: A comprehensive review, Internet of Things (Netherlands), 18, (2022); Park, Sebeom, Applications of unmanned aerial vehicles in mining from exploration to reclamation: A review, Minerals, 10, 8, pp. 1-32, (2020); Iccpt 2019 Current Problems of Transport Proceedings of the 1st International Scientific Conference, (2019)","L.-M.

Single-photon LiDAR (SPL) is a promising class of LiDAR technology that relies on single-photon detectors (SPDs) that can achieve extremely sensitive detection levels and performance, providing new sensing capabilities for object detection and identification. Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are low-cost, scalable, solid-state SPDs that are compatible with existing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit (IC) design techniques; this makes them an ideal candidate for imaging-based SPL systems. Various SPAD-based SPL configurations are reviewed; a specific type known as 3D flash LiDAR represents a compact system that can acquire a 3D depth-resolved image of a scene instantaneously, can measure fine spatial details of objects in the scene, and is capable of imaging through partial obscurants. These abilities allow high-speed image capture and classification of fast-moving objects, especially those that are hard to see and concealed in highly cluttered backgrounds, capabilities that are highly desirable for military applications. The key to improving the performance and functionality of 3D flash LiDAR systems for long-range sensing and tracking applications is the SPAD array also known as a focal-plane array (FPA) sensor. The FPA includes both an array of SPAD detectors and CMOS-compatible electronics and/or readout integrated circuits (ROICs) which collectively can be considered a smart-pixel array. The number of smart pixels on the FPA determines both the field of view (FOV) for the 3D flash LiDAR system and the amount of scene data generated. This data needs to be processed at a fast-enough rate to ensure minimal latency times for real-time operation; this is especially important when imaging and tracking moving objects. To address the FOV limitations, SPAD FPA imaging sensors packing more pixels per unit size is achievable by using advanced 3D stacking assembly and integration technologies, while new ROIC capabilities employing machine vision computation methods and event-based neuromorphic processing solutions can overcome the data processing bottleneck problem; all these techniques are discussed. Novel neuromorphic event-based SPAD FPA sensor architectures are presented, showing that event-based methods are superior to the frame-based approaches in terms of reducing the output data rate, improving imaging responsivity, being less susceptible to noise, and enabling fast processing speed for real-time detection and classification. Future SPAD FPA image sensors that can integrate neuromorphic computing methods with artificially intelligent (AI) techniques will reduce power consumption and data flow and offer new detection and learning processing capabilities. Advanced 3D manufacturing and integration techniques will see further increase in performance, beyond what is possible with Moore’s law. The next generation of smart SPL imaging sensors will have the potential to defeat stealth or low observable (LO) technologies; improve surveillance imaging from space, in air, and underwater; sense fast-moving objects partially concealed behind obscurants with low detectability; and identify objects in very low light conditions and/or hidden in background clutter. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author (s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","3D flash LiDAR; 3D TOF cameras; Deep learning for LiDAR; Event-based processors; Event-based SPAD imagers; Event-based vision; Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers; Single-photon LiDAR (SPL); Single-photon sensors; SPAD LiDAR; Time-of-flight (TOF) LiDAR","","","","","","","","Laser Radar Progress and Opportunities in Active Electro Optical Sensing, (2014); Laurenzis, Martin, Tracking and prediction of small unmanned aerial vehicles' flight behavior and three-dimensional flight path from laser gated viewing images, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 11005, (2019); Molebny, Vasyl V., Laser radar: Historical prospective-from the East to the West, Optical Engineering, 56, 3, (2017); Quantum Radar, (2011); Madonini, Francesca, Single Photon Avalanche Diode Arrays for Quantum Imaging and Microscopy, Advanced Quantum Technologies, 4, 7, (2021); Tobin, Rachael, Long-range depth profiling of camouflaged targets using single-photon detection, Optical Engineering, 57, 3, (2018); Non Acoustic Submarine Detection Centre for Strategic International Studies, (2019); Armbruster, Walter, Segmentation, classification, and pose estimation of maritime targets in flash-ladar imagery, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 8542, (2012); Bruschini, Claudio E., Ten years of biophotonics single-photon SPAD imager applications: Retrospective and outlook, Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE, 10069, (2017); Gyongy, Istvan J., A 256×256 , 100-kfps, 61% Fill-Factor SPAD Image Sensor for Time-Resolved Microscopy Applications, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, 65, 2, pp. 547-554, (2018)","D.

The country's constitution requires the reforestation of fire-affected zones, which can be achieved using remote sensing techniques for identification and rehabilitation. Regarding animal health, current methods for monitoring require assessments and diagnoses from veterinary professionals, leading to delayed treatment and a decline in health. To address this issue, we propose a system that tracks animal health and enables primary diagnosis by the animal's owner. The system includes sensors for blood pressure, ECG, temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate, installed on the animal's body to collect physiological data. Furthermore, the spread of crop destruction by dangerous wild animals has become a societal issue, impacting communities and regions, and causing problems such as roadkill and village appearance. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a plan for reducing the number of dangerous animals and maintaining a healthy population. This can be achieved through big data analysis algorithms for dangerous animals, real-time wired/wireless data processing, and performance monitoring research, resulting in an IoT and AI-based intelligent system for harmful wild animal extermination that can be applied in farmhouses, orchards, airports, and military boundaries. © 2023 IEEE.","AI; Animal Monitor; Forest Fire; Heart Rate; Sensors","Blood pressure; Data handling; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Heart; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Air temperature; Animal health; Animal monitor; Forest fire prediction; Forest fires; Heart-rate; Mediterranean climates; Monitoring system; Summer months; Wild animals; Animals","","","","","","","Stringa, Elena, Content-based retrieval and real time detection from video sequences acquired by surveillance systems, IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, 3, pp. 138-142, (1998); Pami, (2000); 2009 International Conference on Education Technology and Computer, (2009); Chiu, Shihhsuan, An effective surveillance video retrieval method based upon motion detection, IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics, 2008, IEEE ISI 2008, pp. 261-262, (2008); Mekha, Panuwat, Web Application for Sick Animals Health Monitoring System, 2020 Joint International Conference on Digital Arts, Media and Technology with ECTI Northern Section Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, ECTI DAMT and NCON 2020, pp. 123-127, (2020); Wang, Hai, A wireless sensor network for feedlot animal health monitoring, IEEE Sensors Journal, 16, 16, pp. 6433-6446, (2016); Wang, Jie, Research of Forest Fire Points Detection Method Based on MODIS Active Fire Product, Proceedings - 2021 28th International Conference on Geoinformatics, Geoinformatics 2021, (2021); Güre, Mülayim, Use of satellite images for forest fires in area determination and monitoring, RAST 2009 - Proceedings of 4th International Conference on Recent Advances Space Technologies, pp. 27-32, (2009)","H.M.

Therefore, the purpose of the study is to substantiate methodological foundations of information support of decision-making in the field of national security of Ukraine and their implementation within the framework of the created system, which provides for the collection of information, in particular, using space and geographic information systems, and the use of mathematical modelling and situational analysis methods for data processing. In the course of the research, methods of econometric modelling, structural and functional modelling, and spatial analysis were used. A methodological framework has been developed for decision-making support to address the problems of food, environmental, and socio-economic components of national security. A functional model and algorithm of the decision-making process in the field of national security are constructed and, based on the results obtained, a decision-making system in the field of food, environmental, and socio-economic security is developed. In addition, the study formalises the conceptual provisions of the decision-making support process in the field of national security; a procedure for modelling the country's food security indicators is proposed. Based on the proposed methodological approach, it was determined how much the area of crops decreased due to the temporary occupation and military operations, and the post-war state of fields (minelaying, destruction of crops, equipment, etc.), which allowed forming input data for further projecting of indicators of the development of the agricultural sector and food security in Ukraine, the EU, and the world. The proposed methodological provisions, algorithms, models, and the developed system can be used by state authorities to make managerial decisions on the development of policy in the areas of ensuring food, environmental, and socio-economic security of the country. © © The Author(s).

The main research goal of this paper is to provide the lean-logistics geosystem research concept as a contemporary approach of constructive geography closely connected with industry as a part of the service sector based on leading scientific principles, GIS-technologies and remote sensing data processing software involvement, and to give some details about this concept applied implementation. All these arguments allow us to specify and to study in-depth the peculiarities, key types, and specificities of the lean-logistics. In this paper, Lean-logistics is understood as an environmental service that helps to improve biodiversity and a stable environment. Lean-logistics itself can be developed as a type of modelling land use and land management activities. This activity can be even thought of as educational innovation with nature-based solutions. The key geographic-centered ideas of the concept of Lean-logistics are integration, engineering, economization, ecologization, socialization, and humanization of modern human activities. The methodological basis of Lean-logistics is presented by three sections, such as Section I. Theory of logistics (for instance, such aspects as general characteristics of logistics and its key features, Varieties of logistics and its classification, Lean logistics as a science: its place in logistics, key distinct features, etc.), Section II. Applied logistics (with such aspects as Military logistics, Business logistics, Environmental logistics, Urban logistics, and Logistics services), and Section III. Logistical construction (Lean-construction of commodity flows and Lean-construction in the field of services). The practical basis of Lean-logistics is formed by logic modelling (studios). Logic modelling in Lean-logistics are called logistics studios and are understood as a form of active practical activities of researchers. Summarizing and generalizing key ideas discussed in the text, the authors underline that the conceptual framework of the lean-logistics geosystem research is based on the implementation of four cross-cutting lines such as environmental security and sustainable development, health and safety, civic responsibility, business undertaking, and financial literacy. All of them aimed at forming a conscious citizen, all areas of activity of which are permeated by logistics chains. Concluding the research, the authors emphasize that the lean-logistics concept may be quite useful within the proposed content of Lean-logistics as a page navigator E-collection in the form of a book trailer. Some pages of it contain examples of the multimedia scrapbook of interactive exercises (deal with some definite sections and/or topics) which are presented using the Print Screen-visualization of the logistics lotto. The use of such tools, forms, technologies, techniques in the study of the content of “Lean-logistics in geography”, as E-collection, book-trailer, hotlist, multimedia scrapbook, mind mapping software, QR-coding, Print Screen-visualization, with active use of GIS, educational Internet services, modernizes the learning process and with systematic use in practice makes them necessary and appropriate in the knowledge about geography and constructive geography. © Udovychenko Viktoriia, Udovychenko Iryna, 2022.","constructive geography; Lean-logistics; lean-logistics practices; lean-logistics scrapbook; logistics; methodology; practice; theoretical background; theory","","","","","","","","Biljecki, Filip, Applications of 3D city models: State of the art review, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 4, 4, pp. 2842-2889, (2015); 3D City Models and Urban Information Current Issues and Perspectives, (2014); Systems of Cities Readings on Structure Growth and Policy, (1978); Bozeman, Barry, Scientific and technical information and urban policy-making, Urban Systems, 3, 4, pp. 161-162, (1978); Introduction to GIS for Urban Studies Urbanst 164, (2013); Spatial Processes Models and Applications, (1981); Ann Japan Asso Econ Geogr, (1997); Du, Guoqing, Using GIS for analysis of urban systems, GeoJournal, 52, 3, pp. 213-221, (2000); Geoprocessing in Arcgis, (2006); Feng, Zhu, A Review of “tourism and transport: Modes, networks and flows”: David timothy duval clevedon, buffalo, toronto, channel view publications, 2007, 327, Tourism Geographies, 12, 4, pp. 579-582, (2010)","","","V N Karazin Kharkiv National University","","","","","","24107360","","","","English","Visn.

Leveraging the advancements in cloud-based remote sensing data processing through Google Earth Engine (GEE), a web-based, freely accessible seasonal river morphological monitoring system for Ayeyarwady River, Myanmar was developed through a collaborative process to assess changes in river morphology over time and space. The monitoring system uses Landsat satellite data spanning a 31-year long period (1988–2019) to map river planform changes along 3881.4 km of river length including Upper Ayeyarwady, Lower Ayeyarwady, and Chindwin. It is designed to operate on a seasonal timescale by comparing pre-monsoon and post-monsoon channel conditions to provide timely information on erosion and accretion areas for the stakeholders to support planning and management. The morphological monitoring system was validated with 85 reference points capturing the field conditions in 2019 and was found to be reliable for operational use with an overall accuracy of 89%. The average eroded riverbank area was calculated at around 45, 101, and 134 km2 for Chindwin, Upper Ayeyarwady, and Lower Ayeyarwady, respectively. The historical channel change assessment aided us to identify and categorize river reaches according to the frequency of changes. Six hotspots of riverbank erosion were identified including near Mandalay city, the confluence of Upper Ayeyarwady and Chindwin, near upstream of Magway city, downstream of Magway city, near Pyay city, and upstream of the Ayeyarwady delta. The web-based monitoring system simplifies the application of freely available remote sensing data over the large spatial domain to assess river planform changes to support stakeholders’ operational planning and prioritizing investments for sustainable Ayeyarwady River management. © 2022 by the authors.","Ayeyarwady River; Google Earth Engine; remote sensing; river morphology; riverbank erosion","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Data handling; Engines; Erosion; Investments; Monitoring; Morphology; Optical remote sensing; Websites; Ayeyarwady river; Google earth engine; Google earths; Monitoring system; Remote sensing data; Remote-sensing; River management; River morphology; Riverbank erosion; Spatial domains; Rivers","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; United States Agency for International Development, USAID","This research was funded by joint US Agency for International Development (USAID) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) initiative SERVIR and the USAID Regional Development Mission for Asia and Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) rapid response fund and tool development fund.","Grabowski, Robert C., Characterizing geomorphological change to support sustainable river restoration and management, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Water, 1, 5, pp. 483-512, (2014); Reference Module in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences, (2018); Abbas, Nazar, Erosion and sediment transport in the Ganges river basin (India), Journal of Hydrology, 69, 1-4, pp. 173-182, (1984); Syvitski, James P.M., Impact of humans on the flux of terrestrial sediment to the global coastal ocean, Science, 308, 5720, pp. 376-380, (2005); Kummu, Matti, Sediment-related impacts due to upstream reservoir trapping, the Lower Mekong River, Geomorphology, 85, 3-4, pp. 275-293, (2007); Kale, Vishwas S., Flood hydrology and geomorphology of monsoon-dominated rivers: The indian peninsula, Water International, 22, 4, pp. 259-265, (1997); Kale, Vishwas S., Fluvial geomorphology of Indian rivers: An overview, Progress in Physical Geography, 26, 3, pp. 400-433, (2002); Keskinen, Marko, The water-energy-food nexus and the transboundary context: Insights from large Asian rivers, Water (Switzerland), 8, 5, (2016); Ayeyarwady River and the Economy of Myanmar Report, (2018); Drr Team Mission Report, (2015)","D.

In order to secure the IKN from all possible enemy attacks, a military defense base is needed that functions as a Logistics support center to support all military operations. The purpose of this study is to determine a strategic location as a center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines in order to secure the IKN area using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method combined with satellite image analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS) by considering the criteria and sub-criteria in determining the location center for maritime defense logistics distribution lines. The results of the research from the AHP weighting method show that the priority order of criteria based on experts is safety from natural conditions, population conditions, environmental locations, distribution line conditions, and required cost. The results of remote sensing satellite image data processing with analysis using Geographic Information Systems with ArcGIS software shows that the results of satellite image overlays are equipped with regional boundaries and routes around IKN. The determination of the location of the center of the distribution line for the defense logistics of the marine sector is concentrated in Samboja District, surely in the Kampung Lama Village which is also used as the location point for the pier plan. Kampung Lama Village, Samboja has criteria and sub-criteria that meet to be used as a central location for maritime defense logistics distribution lines to secure the IKN area. Obviously, Kampung Lama Village is also used as the location point for the pier plan. © 2022 IEEE.","Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP); Geographic Information System (GIS); IKN Nusantara; logistics distribution center","Hierarchical systems; Image analysis; Information systems; Information use; Location; Military operations; Network security; Piers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Condition; Defence logistics; Distribution lines; Geographic information system; IKN nusantarum; Logistic distributions; Logistics distribution centers; Remote sensing satellites; Geographic information systems","","","","","","Thank you to the Faculty of Defense Technology- Republic of Indonesia Defense University for all their support so that this research can be done successfully.","Remote Sensing and Image Interpretation, (2000); Widya Scientific Journal, (2013); Underground Mining Education and Training Center, (2017); Karya Tulis Karakteristik Citra Satelit, (2008); Developments Challenges and Prospects of Remote Sensing Technology Utilization in Indonesia and Utilization of Remote Sensing Technology in Natural Resources Management in Indonesia, (2020); Journal of Sensing Technology, (2019); Selection of Final Disposal Sites Tpa Bangkalan Regency Garbage with Information System Assistance Geographical GIS, (2013); Lex Et Societatis, (2015); Simulasi Sistem Informasi Posisi Kereta Api Dengan Menggunakan GPS Untuk Keselamatan Penumpang, (2010); Townshend, John R.G., Information extraction from remotely sensed data.

The use of multi-source heterogeneous images for fusion to obtain target and scene information more accurately and comprehensively has potential important applications in many fields such as military, medicine, and meteorology, and has become an important branch of image processing research. To this end, a PCGP algorithm is proposed in this paper to realize the fusion of optical images from different sources and SAR images. It first applies PCA transformation to the multi-source data images to obtain the principal component variables, then performs histogram matching on the first principal components of the transformed data sources, and finally uses the gradient pyramid decomposition algorithm to fuse the matched images to obtain a fused image. Then, the proposed fusion algorithm is tested in the fusion task of remote sensing images from different sources of GF2, GF6 and GF3. The experimental results show that the proposed fusion algorithm has better results. © 2022 IEEE.","image fusion; Multi-sensor heterogeneous remote sensing image; PCGP algorithm","Geometrical optics; Metadata; Military applications; Military photography; Optical data processing; Optical remote sensing; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Fusion algorithms; Imaging mechanism; Military medicine; Multi sensor; Multi-sensor heterogeneous remote sensing image; Multi-source images; Multi-Sources; PCGP algorithm; Remote sensing images; Target scenes; Image fusion","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61201304, 61201308); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 61201304 and 61201308.

Therefore, the realization of an efficient and accurate automatic data processing approach has become a research hotspot in this field.Aiming at the characteristics of a high resolution, complex background, and small target scale of a remote sensing image, this paper proposes an improved YOLOv3 algorithm to improve the detection effect of such an image.Based on the original YOLOv3 algorithm, the improved dense connection network replaces the original DarkNet53 as the basic network, thereby improving the scale diversity of network input and prediction results.This study reduces the input loss through the valve stem module, and adds a feature enhancement module to the shallow feature map, thereby enriching the receptive field of the feature map and strengthening the extraction of the shallow feature information of the network, while ensuring the overall detection performance, this study improves the detection accuracy and robustness of the network for medium and small targets in remote sensing images.This study also carried out several groups of comparative experiments on remote sensing image datasets.The results show that, compared with the original YOLOv3 algorithm, the average accuracy of the algorithm is improved by 9.45 percentage points, and the detection accuracy of small-scale targets is increased even more significantly, reaching 11.03 percentage points.In addition, the number of model parameters is effectively reduced. © 2022, Editorial Office of Computer Engineering.

With the advantages of wide coverage and long duration, optical remote sensing satellites are widely used in ship detection. On-orbit satellites can carry out real-time detection and provide timely warning information. However, there are limitations in the detection of large-scale on-orbit remote sensing images. Due to the limited hardware resource of the on-orbit satellites, the on-orbit satellites usually have insufficient processing capacity, which makes it difficult to use highly complex algorithms such as Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to process all of the images. To address this problem, a Region of Interest (ROI) extraction algorithm for large-scale remote sensing images is proposed. The algorithm contains three steps: 1) Firstly edge detection is performed on the image to detect effective targets. 2) Mathematical morphology processing is used to remove the background interference and enhance the ship targets. 3) Connected component analysis is employed to screen the ship targets. The algorithm is accelerated and implemented on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. The computation time is 0.016 seconds with an image as large as 1000×1024. The recall is 93.8% and the precision is 91.3%. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the application of the on-orbit ship detection of large-scale remote sensing images. © 2022 IEEE.","FPGA; image processing; on-orbit satellite; region of interest; ship detection","Edge detection; Extraction; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Image segmentation; Optical data processing; Optical remote sensing; Orbits; Satellites; Ships; Field programmable gate array; Field programmables; Images processing; Large-scales; On-orbit satellites; Programmable gate array; Region-of-interest; Regions of interest; Remote sensing images; Ship detection; Mathematical morphology","","","","","","","Chen, Feng, Graph-based ship extraction scheme for optical satellite image, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), pp. 491-494, (2011); Wang, Xiaoya, Ship Detection in Large Scale Sar Images Based on Bias Classification, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), pp. 1263-1266, (2020); Huang, Jie, Region proposal for ship detection based on structured forests edge method, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2017-July, pp. 1856-1859, (2017); Laser Infrared, (2016); Yu, Jiyang, A real-time on-board ship targets detection method for optical remote sensing satellite, International Conference on Signal Processing Proceedings, ICSP, 0, pp. 204-208, (2016); He, Baigen, Sea Ship Target Detection Method of Remote Sensing Image, Proceedings - 2019 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacturing, AIAM 2019, pp. 405-408, (2019); Gao, Lining, Visual attention based model for target detection in large-field images, Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics, 22, 1, pp. 150-156, (2011); Liu, Qingsong, A fast method for obtaining the region of interest of coastal infrared ship, Proceedings - 2016 8th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics, IHMSC 2016, 2, pp. 236-238, (2016); Lu, Jinyun, The weld image edge-detection algorithm combined with Canny operator and mathematical morphology, Chinese Control Conference, CCC, pp. 4467-4470, (2013); Lee, Han-sung, Accelerating Image Processing on FPGAs using HLS and PYNQ, 2020 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Asia, ICCE-Asia 2020, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society (IMS)","2022 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference, I2MTC 2022","2022-05-16 through 2022-05-19","Ottawa","180602","10915281","9780879425791; 0879425792; 9781665453837; 9781665483605; 9781467346221; 9781467392204; 0780372182; 1424415411; 0780388798; 078038248X","CRIIE","","English","Conf.

Typically, the FMCW-ladar signal is collected by use of the heterodyne detection through the dechirping so as to decrease the sampling rate commensurate with the bandwidth. In this manuscript, we proposed a novel scheme for processing the FMCW-ladar signal acquired through the simplified heterodyne detection, and the sampling rate was the same as that in the dechirp detection. Based on the time–frequency relation of the FMCW-ladar signal, two algorithms were proposed to post-process the echo acquired by the simplified heterodyne detection with the sub-Nyquist sampling rate. For the FMCW-ladar echo data acquired by the simplified heterodyne detection with the same sampling rate as in the traditional dechirp detection, the algorithms can achieve the unambiguous range image retaining the range resolution commensurate with the transmitted chirp bandwidth. The effectiveness of the scheme was validated by simulation and real data processing experiments. The capability of the proposed scheme provides an alternative for the FMCW-ladar system without use of the dechirp detection, which can benefit the future FMCW-ladar and microwave photonics radar applications in the remote sensing. © 2022 Wuhan University.

This observation returns a huge amount of optical multidimensional remote sensing images which may be used in multidisciplinary fields. The processing of these images in real time is a challenging task because of their high spatial resolution and complex data structure. At the same time, these images are quite confidential in various applications such as in the military and intelligence sectors. For secretly transmitting the remote sensing images in real time, a real-time cheating immune secret sharing approach is introduced in this paper. The proposed approach minimizes the time as well as space complexity for the secret sharing effectively. It also generates meaningful shares without the restriction for any fixed number participants. Generated shares by the proposed approach are cheating immune. That means they can authenticate themselves if tampered with.

As this technology becomes integrated into forest management approaches, it is important to consider the implementation of proper safety and data collection strategies. The creation of such documentation is beneficial, because it allows for those aspiring to create a UAS program to learn from others’ experiences, without bearing the consequences of past blunders associated with the development of these practices. When establishing a UAS program, it is pertinent to deeply research the necessary equipment, create documentation that establishes operational norms, and develop standards for in-field operations. Regarding multispectral vs. RGB sensor payloads, the sensor selection should be based upon what type of information is desired from the imagery acquired. It is also important to consider the methods for obtaining the most precise geolocation linked to the aerial imagery collected by the sensor. While selecting the proper UAS platform and sensor are key to establishing a UAS operation, other logistical strategies, such as flight crew training and operational planning, are equally important. Following the acquisition of proper equipment, further preparations must be made in order to ensure safe and efficient operations. The creation of crew resource management and safety management system documentation is an integral part of any successful UAS program. Standard operating procedure documents for individual tasks and undertakings are also a necessity. Standardized practices for the scheduling, communication, and management of the UAS fleet must also be formulated. Once field operations are set in motion, the continuous improvement of the documentation and best practices is paramount. © 2021 by the authors.

Visibility analysis builds on a digital surface model describing the terrain morphology, including the position and shapes of all objects that can sometimes act as visibility barriers. However, some barriers, for example vegetation, may be permeable to a certain degree. Despite extensive research and use of visibility analysis in different areas, standard GIS tools do not take permeability into account. This article presents a new method to calculate visibility through partly permeable obstacles. The method is based on a quasi-Monte Carlo simulation with 100 iterations of visibility calculation. Each iteration result represents 1% of vegetation permeability, which can thus range from 1% to 100% visibility behind vegetation obstacles. The main advantage of the method is greater accuracy of visibility results and easy implementation on any GIS software. The incorporation of the proposed method in GIS software would facilitate work in many fields, such as architecture, archaeology, radio communication, and the military. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Digital surface model; Obstacle object; Permeability; Topographic data processing; Visibility analysis","data processing; digital terrain model; GIS; permeability; software; vegetation","","","","","","","Arnot, R.

Based on the Internet architecture, this paper proposes a multi-class target detection method for high-resolution and high-resolution optical remote sensing images. The fused multi-layer features are used for detection. In view of the challenges of complex background and deformation of the target, the deformable convolution network can be used for reference to extract the characteristics of the target itself and reduce the background interference In order to reduce the storage space required by the deep convolution neural network model and increase the portability of the network, I also put forward a method of lightening the network. Experiments show that our proposed method is feasible. Compared with the popular target detection method based on deep convolution neural network, our method has great advantages in precision and recall rate. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","deep learning; High score optical remote sensing image; Internet architecture; Target detection","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Deformation; Military photography; Network architecture; Neural networks; Optical data processing; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Space optics; Complex background; Convolution neural network; Detection technology; High resolution; Internet architecture; Military fields; Optical remote sensing; Precision and recall; Image processing","","","","","(2013YB286)","This work was financially supported by Guangxi university scientific research fund: Research on the key technologies of vehicle-mounted network based on CPS (2013YB286).","Wang, Mi, Development of On-orbit Geometric Calibration for High Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Satellite, Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University, 42, 11, pp. 1580-1588, (2017); Optoelectronics Letters, (2017); Awad, Mohamad M., Toward Robust Segmentation Results Based on Fusion Methods for Very High Resolution Optical Image and LiDAR Data, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 10, 5, pp. 2067-2076, (2017); Bi, Funkun, A decision mixture model-based method for inshore ship detection using high-resolution remote sensing images, Sensors (Switzerland), 17, 7, (2017); Lan, Zeying, Study on multi-scalewindow determination for GLCM texture description in high-resolution remote sensing image geo-analysis supported by GIS and domain knowledge, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 7, 5, (2018); Yehia, Abdelrahman, Fusion of high-resolution sar and optical imageries based on a wavelet transform and ihs integrated algorithm, International Journal of Engineering Research in Africa, 52, pp. 62-72, (2021); Annals of Glaciology, (2017); Scott, Grant J., Enhanced fusion of deep neural networks for classification of benchmark high-resolution image data sets, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 15, 9, pp. 1451-1455, (2018); Masse, Antoine, Denoising Very High Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Images: Application and Optimization of Nonlocal Bayes method, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 11, 3, pp. 691-700, (2018); Oh, Jaehong, Extraction of digital elevation model using stereo matching with slope-adaptive patch transformation, KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 20, 7, pp. 2902-2909, (2016)","G.

Often the data analytics involves analyzing data in real-time, such as emergency control, surveillance of military operations or scenarios that change rapidly. Traditional data mining requires all the data to be available prior to inducing a model by supervised learning, for automatic image recognition or classification. Any new update on the data prompts the model to be built again by loading in all the previous and new data. Therefore, the training time will increase indefinitely making it unsuitable for real-time application in remote sensing. As a contribution to solving this problem, a new approach of data analytics for remote sensing for data stream mining is formulated and reported in this paper. Fresh data feed collected from afar is used to approximate an image recognition model without reloading the history, which helps eliminate the latency in building the model again and again. In the past, data stream mining has a drawback in approximating a classification model with a sufficiently high level of accuracy. This is due to the one-pass incremental learning mechanism inherently exists in the design of the data stream mining algorithm. In order to solve this problem, a novel streamlined sensor data processing method is proposed called evolutionary expand-and-contract instance-based learning algorithm (EEAC-IBL). The multivariate data stream is first expanded into many subspaces, and then the subspaces, which are corresponding to the characteristics of the features are selected and condensed into a significant feature subset. The selection operates stochastically instead of deterministically by evolutionary optimization, which approximates the best subgroup. Followed by data stream mining, the model learning for image recognition is done on the fly. This stochastic approximation method is fast and accurate, offering an alternative to the traditional machine learning method for image recognition application in remote sensing. Our experimental results show computing advantages over other classical approaches, with a mean accuracy improvement at 16.62%. © 2021 by the authors.

Research on ship detection in ORS images started late compared to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and it is difficult for traditional image-processing algorithms to achieve high accuracy. Therefore, we propose a ship-detection method based on a deep convolutional neural network that is modified from YOLOv3. We call it fused features and rebuilt (FFR) YOLOv3. We tried some improvements to enhance its performance in ship-detection regions. We added a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) structure to the backbone network to strengthen the ability to extract features. Through a large number of experiments, we optimized the backbone network to improve the speed. We improved the multi-scale detection of YOLOv3 by fusing multi-scale feature maps and regenerating them with a high-resolution network, which can improve the accuracy of detection and location. We used the public HRSC2016 ship-detection dataset and remote-sensing images collected from Google Earth to train, test, and verify our network, which reached a detection speed of about 27 frames per second (fps) on an NVIDIA RTX2080ti, with recall (R) = 95.32% and precision (P) = 95.62%. Experiments show that our network has better accuracy and speed than other methods. In addition, it has strong robustness and can adapt to complex environments like inshore ship detection. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Image processing; Military applications; Military photography; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Ships; Statistical tests; Synthetic aperture radar; Back-bone network; Complex environments; Frames per seconds; Image processing algorithm; Multi-scale features; Optical remote sensing; Remote sensing images; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Feature extraction; algorithm; detection method; image processing; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; vessel","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61772331); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU","This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61772331).

Several sonar systems have been established for this purpose over the years and practiced by researchers across the globe. Most of such systems use the methods of underwater acoustics as the customary standard. However, the advances in stealth technology and the complexity involved in ocean acoustics prevent the evolution of acoustic technologies and thus motivates the researchers to examine alternate techniques for the detection of underwater targets in the ocean. Different non-acoustic detection methods are suggested in the recent past to overcome the stealth and acoustic complexity related obstacles. However, the research in this area is scarce and many advances are expected to be originated.

With the development of convolutional neural networks, there are more and more different remote sensing image classification algorithms. In order to improve the accuracy of remote sensing image classification, this paper uses GoogLeNet, ResNet and MobileNet three algorithms to perform remote sensing image classification experiments and optimizes parameters based on the UCM data set. At the same time, the data set is expanded by means of rotation and mirroring, and The pre-training model is loaded through the idea of transfer learning. The experimental results show that GoogleNet, ResNet50 and ResNet101 have the highest accuracy rates of 99.5%, while ResNet34, MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 algorithms have relatively low accuracy rates of 97.1%,93.8% and 96.7%, respectively. The accuracy of the expanded data set has increased by about 1.67% on average, which proves the effectiveness of data expansion in improving the algorithm's performance. © 2021 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; feature learning; remote sensing image classification; UCM","Classification (of information); Convolution; Data handling; Image classification; Image enhancement; Machine learning; Military photography; Remote sensing; Accuracy rate; Convolutional neural network; Data set; Feature learning; Image classification algorithms; Neural network model; Pre-training; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing image classification; UCM; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Pires de Lima, Rafael Pires, Convolutional neural network for remote-sensing scene classification: Transfer learning analysis, Remote Sensing, 12, 1, (2020); Geography and Territorial Research, (2001); Cheng, Gong, Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification: Benchmark and State of the Art, Proceedings of the IEEE, 105, 10, pp. 1865-1883, (2017); Science of Surveying and Mapping, (2019); Kussul, Nataliia N., Deep Learning Classification of Land Cover and Crop Types Using Remote Sensing Data, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 14, 5, pp. 778-782, (2017); Electronic Design Engineering, (2020); Journal of Ordnance Equipment Engineering, (2018); Computer Era, (2021); Szegedy, Christian, Going deeper with convolutions, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 07-12-June-2015, pp. 1-9, (2015); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","6th International Symposium on Computer and Information Processing Technology, ISCIPT 2021","2021-06-11 through 2021-06-13","Virtual, Changsha","175833","","9781665441377","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Because images play a significant role in many applications such as military communication, remote-sensing, and medical-imaging, therefore, it is necessary to protect sensitive and confidential information from unauthorized use and modification. To achieve this objective, encryption is one of the best methods among the information hiding methods. In recent years, many image encryption approaches are designed by the researchers. They use different concepts for image encryption to increase security. The main aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of the existing image encryption approaches. These approaches are categorized based on different concepts such as chaotic maps, DNA, compressive sensing, and optical image encryption. Comparisons are made among the existing approaches to access the various security parameters. Key performance metrics are also presented. The future scope of image encryption is also presented to encourage the research community. © 2021 Mandeep Kaur et al.","","Chaotic systems; Geometrical optics; Medical imaging; Military applications; Military communications; Military photography; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Compressive sensing; Confidential information; Image encryptions; Information hiding; Optical image encryption; Performance metrics; Research communities; Security parameters; Cryptography","","","","","","","Xie, Yaqin, Image encryption scheme with compressed sensing based on new three-dimensional chaotic system, Entropy, 21, 9, (2019); Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering, (2018); Belazi, Akram, A novel image encryption scheme based on substitution-permutation network and chaos, Signal Processing, 128, pp. 155-170, (2016); Kaur, Manjit, Adaptive Differential Evolution-Based Lorenz Chaotic System for Image Encryption, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 43, 12, pp. 8127-8144, (2018); Kaur, Manjit, Beta Chaotic Map Based Image Encryption Using Genetic Algorithm, International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 28, 11, (2018); Kaur, Manjit, Color image encryption using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with local chaotic search based 5D chaotic map, Future Generation Computer Systems, 107, pp. 333-350, (2020); Wang, Xingyuan, A novel image encryption algorithm using chaos and reversible cellular automata, Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 18, 11, pp. 3075-3085, (2013); Zhu, Congxu, Improved cryptanalysis and enhancements of an image encryption scheme using combined 1D chaotic maps, Entropy, 20, 11, (2018); Zhu, Shuqin, Plaintext-Related Image Encryption Algorithm Based on Block Structure and Five-Dimensional Chaotic Map, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 147106-147118, (2019); Sivakumar, T., A novel image encryption using calligraphy based scan method and random number, KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 9, 6, pp. 2317-2337, (2015)","M.

Advancements in scientific research, personal computers, operating systems, geophysical and remote sensing instruments, data storage, and computing power have all provided drivers for change. Measurements of physical properties of the Earth date back to ancient times but it wasn't until the 19th century that geophysics emerged as a discipline to understand our planet's shape, density and gravity field, the water cycle, plate tectonics, resource exploration and later, in the 20th century, for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean. The first exploration magnetometers evolved from fluxgate magnetometers which had been used during World War II to detect submarines. Early geophysical maps were hand-contoured - a time consuming and tedious affair. The skill of the draftsperson was used to interpolate data between survey lines which could lead to variable results. When IBM first introduced the personal computer (PC) in 1981 they revolutionized computer technology. The 1980s became an explosive period of growth in the computer and software industry. Prior to this, companies hired in-house programmers to write software for their specific needs. With the advent of the PC, independent publishers and open architecture changed the face of software development. In 1982, Canadian earth scientists Colin Reeves and Ian MacLeod saw the potential for personal computers to transform the work of geophysics and exploration. From this early vision, Geosoft Inc. was established in 1986 and has developed to become the sustainable industry standard for geophysical data processing and analysis in multiple industry sectors. The computing power of PCs and laptops, combined with software, provided an efficient way to process, interpret, present and enhance large volumes of geophysical measurements of the Earth to create maps and models of the subsurface which could be seen, examined and discussed with others. When advancements such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), originally created for military purposes, became accessible for civilian use, positioning of survey data vastly improved. Ground, airborne, and marine geophysical surveys could easily and accurately pinpoint anomalies using GPS. Geologists could now create pseudo-geologic maps from magnetic or resistivity images, along with the vast quantity of numerical data that was being collected by large arrays of other geophysical and remote sensing techniques. Geosoft's first software program was called MAGMOD, which modeled magnetic profiles over selected anomalies. In the early 1990's the “Sushi” menu-driven interface was developed. With the introduction of Windows 95, Sushi was replaced by the Oasis montaj graphical Windows interface and data structures in 1996 for powerful processing and interpretation of geophysical data. Oasis montaj has continued to evolve to provide an extensive suite of processing, modelling and analysis tools for a variety of geoscience and remote sensing data, encompassing geophysics, geology, geochemistry and GIS to provide advanced understanding of the Earth's subsurface and subsea environments. In 2012, Geosoft launched VOXI, a rapid and responsive solution for large, multiparameter geophysical inversion modelling that harnesses the power of cloud computing. In the early 2000s, Seequent (formerly ARANZ Geo) was founded in Christchurch, New Zealand, with the development of ground-breaking medical 3D imaging technology, that offered a rapid and visual way of gaining accurate information for medical diagnostics. This implicit modelling technology was further developed and in 2004 was first applied to geological science. Offering a new approach to geological modelling, the software made the modelling process not only dramatically faster, but the 3D capabilities also made it highly visual and intuitive. The solution provided a paradigm shift in understanding the earth's subsurface, and quickly became well known as the flagship product called Leapfrog. In 2018, Seequent Limited and Geosoft Inc. joined forces, bringing together Leapfrog 3D geological modelling software with Geosoft's subsurface geoscience software. Today, Seequent is a global leader in the development of powerful geoscience analysis, modelling, and collaborative technologies that enable people to uncover valuable insights from data, creating rich stories and ultimately make better decisions about earth, environment, and energy challenges to address some of the world's biggest challenges. © 2021 J and N Group, Ltd..

The fusion of spatial data, such as those from multi-source digital bathymetric models (DBMs), can effectively improve the efficiency of large-scale seafloor topographical research and the accuracy of the results obtained therein. On the one hand, with the release of 15arc-seconds resolution DBMs, it is now necessary to verify the quality of these new products. On the other hand, in order to generate a new, high-quality, seamless DBM in the South China Sea (SCS) and adjacent areas, an adaptive subregional spatial-domain-weighted fusion framework is proposed. First, seven of the most widely used global DBMs are selected, and multi-source subregional measured depth-sounding data undergo data cleaning and other preprocessing. Next, based on the homogeneity of the terrain features, an adaptive subregional topographical analysis is performed, and the subregional data are weight-fused. Finally, the fusion dataset is post-processed via model smoothing and other procedures. In addition, the advantages and limitations of the DBMs of the SCS are compared. The results show that SRTM15_PLUS V2 is the most reliable of the original DBMs. The updated seamless SCS DBM is void-free and more similar to SRTM15_PLUS V2 with a resolution of 15arc-seconds. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the new model is 99.60 m. Its accuracy is 13%, 40%, 15%, and 1% higher than those achieved by the GEBCO_2019, GEBCO_2014, SRTM30_PLUS, and SRTM15_PLUS models, respectively, and its expression of the topography is more detailed and realistic. The feasibility and limitations of the proposed fusion framework are demonstrated. The present findings provide a useful reference for the timely reconstruction and updating of large-scale seafloor topography from multiple datasets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bathymetry; Digital bathymetric model (DBM); Multi-source data fusion; Seafloor topography; South China Sea (SCS); Weighted fusion","accuracy assessment; bathymetry; data processing; homogeneity; numerical model; seafloor; smoothing; spatial data; terrain; topography; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea","","","","","(2017YFB0504205); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41622109); Jilin Province Key R&D Plan Project; Guangxi Innovation-Driven Development Project, (AA18118038)","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the National Key R&D Plan (Grant No. 2017YFB0504205), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41622109), and the Guangxi Innovative Development Grand Grant (Grant No. AA18118038).

The primary goal of the NYSM is to provide high-quality weather data at high spatial and temporal scales to improve atmospheric monitoring and prediction, especially for extreme weather events. As compared with other statewide networks, the NYSM faced considerable deployment obstacles with New York’s complex terrain, forests, and very rural and urban areas; its wide range of weather extremes; and its harsh winter conditions. To overcome these challenges, the NYSM adopted a number of innovations unique among statewide monitoring systems, including 1) strict adherence to international siting standards and metadata documentation; 2) a hardened system design to facilitate continued operations during extreme, high-impact weather; 3) a station design optimized to monitor winter weather conditions; and 4) a camera installed at every site to aid situational awareness. The network was completed in spring of 2018 and provides data and products to a variety of sectors including weather monitoring and forecasting, emergency management, agriculture, transportation, utilities, and education. This paper focuses on the standard network of the NYSM and reviews the network siting, site configuration, sensors, site communications and power, network operations and maintenance, data quality control, and dissemination. A few example analyses are shown that highlight the benefits of the NYSM. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.","Automatic weather stations; Data processing; Data quality control; In situ atmospheric observations; Instrumentation/sensors; Surface observations","Agricultural robots; Information management; Meteorology; Risk management; Atmospheric monitoring; Data quality control; Emergency management; Environmental Monitoring; Extreme weather events; Situational awareness; Spatial and temporal scale; Winter weather conditions; Weather forecasting; climate modeling; data quality; in situ test; regional climate; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; weather forecasting; winter; New York [United States]; United States","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Research Foundation for the State University of New York, RFSUNY; State University of New York, SUNY; Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, (FEMA-4085-DR-NY); Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA; University at Albany","Acknowledgments.

At the same time, due to the advancement of Earth observation, surveying, and mapping technology, spatial data with high precision and wide coverage has grown rapidly, leading to an era of geospatial big data. Under this background, how to quickly and efficiently construct Internet map services becomes the current research priorities and challenges. Grid tiles has been used to construct Internet maps at the beginning, and played an important role in the fast-growing popularity of Internet maps. However, with the mobilization of maps and the gradual deepening of applications, the disadvantages of large size and low efficiency of applying grid tiles are becoming more and more obvious, which is difficult to meet the needs of applications. Vector tiles have many advantages over traditional grid tiles, such as small in size, high in generation efficiency, and support dynamic interaction, are becoming the focus of next generation Internet map service research. In order to further accelerate the processing speed and enhance the scalability in current vector tile application, this study uses big data technology for vector tile processing. Firstly, we uses the parallel computing framework-Spark, to build the vector tile pyramid model. Specifically, through customizing the Spark conversion function, the steps of tile generation are parallelized, and the original vector data GeoJson is converted into a vector tile set-MapBox Vector Tile (Mvt). Then we designs a tile storage model-VectorTile Store, to store the generated Mvt based on the distributed memory filesystem-Alluxio. The VectorTile Store model stores data with key-value pairs, with the tile metadata occupying the first eight key-value pairs, and each single tile occupying a key-value pair. When the data is being written, a hash index is built based on the key for fast access. This model efficiently stores massive tiles and is highly scalable. The experimental results show that the vector tile parallel construction algorithm and distributed storage model proposed in this paper are more efficient than traditional schemes, and are more suitable for massive vector tile data processing. © 2020, Science Press.

Particularly in cases of (man-made or natural) disaster incident response coordination scenarios, geospatial video analytics is valuable to provide situational awareness. The edge computing or fog computing needs to be designed with resilient performance while interfacing with the core cloud in order to cater to user’s (i.e. incident commander’s, first responder’s) quality of experience (QoE) expectations. An additional barrier for geospatial video analytics is the fact that the distributed locations generating imagery or video content are rarely equipped with high-performance computation capabilities to run computer vision algorithms. In this chapter, we explain the main architectural concepts of fog computing that can help in overcoming the resource scale/diversity limitations for real-time geospatial video analytics, while also ensuring that reliability and management challenges are met. More specifically, we describe a novel cloud-fog computing paradigm that integrates computer vision, edge routing, and computer/network virtualization areas in geospatial video analytics. We detail the state-of-the-art techniques and illustrate our new/improved solution approaches based on “function-centric” computing for the two problems of (1) high-throughput data collection from IoT devices at the wireless edge, and (2) seamless data processing at the infrastructure edge and core cloud platforms. To assist the high-throughput IoT data collection at the wireless edge, we present a novel deep learning-augmented geographic edge routing that relies on physical area knowledge obtained from satellite imagery. To assist the seamless data processing, we describe a novel cloud-fog computing framework that utilizes microservice decomposition and service chaining supported by a constrained-shortest-path algorithm. We conclude with a list of open challenges for adopting fog computing in geospatial video analytics for a variety of applications (e.g. face recognition in crowds, object tracking in aerial wide-area motion imagery, reconnaissance, and video surveillance) relevant to delivering disaster-incident situational awareness. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Disaster-incident situational awareness; Fog computing; Fog/cloud data processing; Function-centric computing; Geospatial video analytics","","","","","","","","Thoma, George R., People locator: A system for family reunification, IT Professional, 14, 3, pp. 13-21, (2012); Pelapur, Rengarajan V., Persistent target tracking using likelihood fusion in wide-area and full motion video sequences, 15th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION 2012, pp. 2420-2427, (2012); Schurr, Nathan, The future of bisaster response: Humans working with multiagent teams using DEFACTO, AAAI Spring Symposium - Technical Report, SS-05-01, pp. 9-16, (2005); A Case Study on Unconstrained Facial Recognition Using the Boston Marathon Bombings Suspects, (2013); Gargees, Rasha S., Incident-Supporting Visual Cloud Computing Utilizing Software-Defined Networking, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 27, 1, pp. 182-197, (2017); Chemodanov, Dmitrii, A Near Optimal Reliable Composition Approach for Geo-Distributed Latency-Sensitive Service Chains, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 2019-April, pp. 1792-1800, (2019); Dinh, Thai Hoang, A survey of mobile cloud computing: Architecture, applications, and approaches, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 13, 18, pp. 1587-1611, (2013); Fernando, Niroshinie, Mobile cloud computing: A survey, Future Generation Computer Systems, 29, 1, pp. 84-106, (2013); Burchard, Josiah, Wireless Mesh networking Protocol for sustained throughput in edge computing, 2017 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications, ICNC 2017, pp. 958-962, (2017); Cvetkovski, Andrej, Hyperbolic embedding and routing for dynamic graphs, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 1647-1655, (2009)","","","wiley","","","","","","","9781119551713; 9781119551690","","","English","Fog Computing: Theory and Practice","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102162229"

Over time, the act of scientific interpretation has transformed into one mediated through machines, creating distance between the observer and the observed. Machine learning is expanding this gap and transforming how we gain knowledge about the world. Raising the question is there something to be lost by advancing machine learning at the expense of human visual interpretation? Objectives: Recognizing the usefulness of these computational algorithms for dealing with massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic ecological datasets, scientists should not abandon the important contributions of human intelligence to understanding landscape patterns, processes, and relationships. Methods: This paper presents a review of social, cultural, and political or military influences on the relationship between humans and remote sensing images of the landscape. This review highlights tensions between automated machine learning approaches and human interpretation. Results: Support for the use of human–machine integrated systems through the use of interactive, visual display, and the development of transparent machine learning methods is suggested. Conclusions: The human analyst should remain central in the design of landscape ecology applications when deploying machine learning algorithms. The complementary strengths of the human and machine in data processing suggest that the most informative insights regarding pattern and process can happen in the implementation of carefully designed Human in the Loop systems. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Affect; Landscape; Machine learning; Visual perception","algorithm; landscape; landscape ecology; landscape structure; machine learning; remote sensing; visual analysis","","","","","","","Adamo, Maria Patrizia, Expert knowledge for translating land cover/use maps to General Habitat Categories (GHC), Landscape Ecology, 29, 6, pp. 1045-1067, (2014); Ahlqvist, Ola, Spatial and semantic dimensions of landscape heterogeneity, Landscape Ecology, 25, 4, pp. 573-590, (2010); Art and Cartography Six Historical Essays, (1987); Gennady Andrienko, Gennady, Geovisual analytics for spatial decision support: Setting the research agenda, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 21, 8, pp. 839-857, (2007); Beyond Artificial Intelligence, (2015); Atkinson, Keith B., Deville and Photographic Surveying, The Photogrammetric Record, 15, 86, pp. 189-195, (1995); Airopaidia Containing the Narrative of A Balloon Excursion from Chester, (1786); Bianchetti, Raechel A., Describing the problem-solving strategies of expert image interpreters using graphical knowledge elicitation methods, GIScience and Remote Sensing, 53, 5, pp. 561-577, (2016); Bianchetti, Raechel A., Cognitive themes emerging from air photo interpretation texts published to 1960, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 4, 2, pp. 551-571, (2015); Billing, Björn, Circular visions: viewing the world from above in the late eighteenth century, Journal of Historical Geography, 63, pp. 61-72, (2019)","R.A.

Orbital debris objects pose a threat to these satellites as their orbit cannot be changed in order to avoid a collision. In recent years, the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) programme has been assisting national institutions in the upgrading of their space debris detection and monitoring capabilities. One of the latest such systems within this programme is the BIRALES space surveillance system based in Italy. The receiving antenna is a radio telescope that is made up of 32 receivers which are placed on eight parabolic cylindrical reflectors of the North-South arm of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF)'s Northern Cross. This work introduces a new software backend which was developed for this novel space debris sensor. The system was designed to be a fast, highly configurable software backend for the radio telescope's acquisition and processing system and whose monitoring and control can be realized by a simple front-end web-based application. The real-time detection of Resident Space Object (RSO) is an important prerequisite for such a system as it gives the operator an immediate feedback loop on any detections whilst keeping the storage requirements at a minimum given that there is no need to save the raw data. The detection of high-velocity objects is achieved by means of a specially developed data processing pipeline that uses the received raw antenna voltages to generate a number of beams, collectively known as a multipixel, that cover the Field of View (FoV) of the instrument. The trajectory of the detected objects is determined by considering the illumination sequence within this multipixel. The initial results on known objects represent the first steps in extending the growing network of European SST systems. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","radar; real-time data processing; remote sensing; Space situational awareness","","","","","","(237/ G/GRO/COPE/16/8935-1SST2016, 785257-2-3SST2016); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (785257); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","The research activities and operations described in this paper were developed thanks to the funding from the European Commission Framework Programme H2020 and Copernicus, SST Space Surveillance and Tracking contract Nos. 785257-2-3SST2016 and 237/ G/GRO/COPE/16/8935-1SST2016.

This system is intended for solving problems of spatial planning and regional management. Spatial planning allows for the analysis and coordination of various activities in time and space, taking into account the state of the surrounding ecosystems. Application of spatial planning methods in the scale of a region allows to estimate complex influence of various activities (economic, environmental, military, etc.) both on natural and ecological systems, and on other activities. In addition, spatial planning methods allow to detect and prevent potential conflicts between major stakeholders operating within a region's borders. Currently, spatial planning and regional management decision makers use different software systems to analyse heterogeneous data. However, such systems are often imperfect and cannot meet the information needs of decision makers. We believe that in order to improve the efficiency of decision support it is necessary to carry out preliminary preparation of visualized information in accordance with the information needs of a particular user. For this purpose, we suggest using adaptive approaches to visualize heterogeneous data, including cognitive geovisualization. The architecture offered in the paper will increase the efficiency of decision making in the field of spatial planning and regional management. The architecture includes methods and tools of detection and identification of potential contradictions, associated with the activity of the main stakeholders of the region, operating common natural objects, resources and territories. To identify potential conflicts of nature users, the previously developed conceptual model of the subject area, semantic model of the subject area and technology for dynamic visualization of spatial data are used. The integrated approach to data processing and visualization proposed in this paper can be used to build cognitive user interfaces for decision support systems. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Our goal is to work toward mine-wide, digital, and real-time three-dimensional geotechnical situational awareness and predictive capabilities in complex underground mining operations. This will benefit operators, engineers, and management by enabling them to develop a more proactive approach to ground control. To this end, and inspired by research in the field of remote sensing and autonomous robotics, this paper assesses the potential of mobile light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data acquisition for high-frequency, high-accuracy monitoring tasks in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) deprived underground mines. Limitations of current monitoring practices are reviewed. Relevant academic and commercial developments in the fields of indoor mobile mapping systems (MMSs) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), robust autonomous robotic platforms, and automated remote sensing data processing are highlighted, and their current shortfalls are evaluated. To conclude, the ramifications of this work for the development of future autonomous underground mine monitoring solutions are discussed. © Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Ground Control in Mining, ICGCM 2020.","","Data acquisition; Data handling; Global positioning system; Indoor positioning systems; Mapping; Optical radar; Rock mechanics; SLAM robotics; Commercial development; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Light detection and ranging; Mobile mapping systems; Predictive capabilities; Simultaneous localization and mapping; Situational awareness; Underground mining operations; Remote sensing","","","","","","","South African Journal of Geomatics, (2013); Geomechanics and Geodynamics of Rock Masses Proceedings of the 2018 European Rock Mechanics Symposium, (2018); Benton, Donovan J., Close-range photogrammetry in underground mining ground control, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 9977, (2016); Laser and Photogrammetric Methods for Rock Face Characterization, (2006); Bonci, G., Implementation of real time geotechnical monitoring at an open pit mountain coal mine in Western Canada (update), Landslides and Engineered Slopes.

Although some achievements have been made in the relevant research, how to realize fast and effective ground aircraft target detection is still a challenging task because of the complex background of remote sensing image, large scale change and small imaging size, etc. Aiming at the application scenarios of multi-frame imaging, such as embedded detection and tracking system, this thesis proposes an aircraft target detection scheme based on hierarchical screening, which can improve the detection speed and reduce false alarm. Firstly, by analyzing the background characteristics, a target candidate region extraction method based on gray variance is adopted, and the acceleration is realized by integrating graph and shared computation. Then, the haar-like features are extracted in the candidate regions, which are then classified by the cascade AdaBoost classifier. Afterwards, a union-find-sets algorithm is used to merge the redundancy detection results and evaluate the confidence.

Images with non-uniform brightness are visually limited due to low ambient light during imaging or excessive exposure, fogging, hazing, or a combination of these factors. As a result, a process of imaging improvement is highly complex with some conditions. Particularly, this issue is harmful for the underwater environments as well as its highly complexity. In this paper, we improve the underwater images from different environments by exploiting image processing techniques including elimination of fogging in the image, and improvement of contrast with combining super resolution methods which result in significant enhancement of the image quality. To remove fogging in the image enhancement method, a variational-based fusion method was proposed without increasing or decreasing image resolution to increase the adaptability of non-uniform backlight images. This approach is optimized by the bee colony algorithm. Additionally, weighting coefficient selection method is used for super resolution of image after adjusting contrast. The main reason for using hybrid contrast techniques includes the adaptive enhancement and color correction. The bee colony algorithm and weighting coefficient in super resolution due to the lack of hybrid methods in visually improved water images has been the subject of recent researches. The hybrid set has provided more effect on different images at various conditions. Having applied the algorithm set for low-quality visual image set of underwater, some analyses such as PSNR, MSE and SSIM are tested. Compared to similar solutions, the quality is significantly improved and highlighted the exhaustive operation of the algorithm. Applying the presented algorithm in the software part of underwater imaging systems is widely effective for the accurate analysis of underwater images. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptive contrast enhancement; Bee colony algorithm; Super resolution; Underwater images; Weighting coefficient selection","Fog dispersal; Gas industry; Geometrical optics; Image analysis; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Imaging systems; Optical cables; Optical data processing; Optical resolving power; Petroleum industry; Public utilities; Remote sensing; Telecommunication industry; Underwater imaging; Bee colony algorithms; Evolutionary models; Geometrical reconstruction; Image processing technique; Oil and gas companies; Superresolution methods; Underwater environments; Weighting coefficient; Image enhancement","","","","","","","Lu, Huimin, Underwater Optical Image Processing: a Comprehensive Review, Mobile Networks and Applications, 22, 6, pp. 1204-1211, (2017); Modern Approaches Oceanogr Petrochem Sci, (2018); Ma, Jinxiang, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization-Based Fusion in YIQ and HSI Color Spaces for Underwater Image Enhancement, International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, 32, 7, (2018); Gao, Shaobing, Underwater Image Enhancement Using Adaptive Retinal Mechanisms, IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society, 28, 11, pp. 5580-5595, (2019); Ancuți, Cosmin, Multi-scale underwater descattering, Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition, 0, pp. 4202-4207, (2016); Li, Chongyi, Single underwater image restoration by blue-green channels dehazing and red channel correction, ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings, 2016-May, pp. 1731-1735, (2016); Abdul Ghani, Ahmad Shahrizan, Integration of enhanced background filtering and wavelet fusion for high visibility and detection rate of deep sea underwater image of underwater vehicle, 2017 5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICoIC7 2017, (2017); Lu, Huimin, Underwater image super-resolution by descattering and fusion, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 670-679, (2017); Ding, Xueyan, Towards underwater image enhancement using super-resolution convolutional neural networks, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 819, pp. 479-486, (2018); Hu, Haofeng, Enhancing Visibility of Polarimetric Underwater Image by Transmittance Correction, IEEE Photonics Journal, 9, 3, (2017)","F.

This prototype array was deployed during an experiment between Jeffrey's Ledge and the Stellwagen Bank region off the coast of Rockport, Massachusetts USA. During the experiment, several humpback whale vocalizations, distant ship tonals and high frequency conventional echosounder pings were recorded. Visual confirmation of humpback moving in bearing relative to the array verifies the directional sensing from array beamforming. During deployment, the array is towed at speeds varying from 4-7 kts in water depths of roughly 100 m with conditions at sea state 2 to 3. This array system consists of a portable winch with array, tow cable and 3 water-resistant boxes housing electronics. This system is deployed and operated by 2 crew members onboard a 13 m commercial fishing vessel during the experiment. Non-acoustic sensor (NAS) information is obtained to provide depth, temperature, and heading data using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components utilizing RS485/232 data communications. Acoustic data sampling was performed at 8 kHz, 30 kHz and 100 kHz with near real-time processing of data and enhanced Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) from beamforming. The electrical system components are deployed with 3 stacked electronics boxes housing power, data acquisition and data processing components in water resistant compartments. A laptop computer with 8 TB of external storage and an independent Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna is used to run Passive Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (POAWRS) software providing beamformed spectrogram data and live NAS data with capability of capturing several days of data. The acquisition system consists of Surface Mount Device (SMD) pre-amplifiers with filter to an analog differential pair shipboard COTS acquisition system. Pre-amplifiers are constructed using SMD technology where components are pressure tolerant and potting is not necessary. Potting of connectors, electronics and hydrophones via 3D printed molding techniques will be discussed. Array internal components are manufactured with Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) 3D printed material to dampen array vibrations with forward and aft vibration isolation modules (VIM). Polyurethane foam (PUF) used to scatter breathing waves and dampen contact from wires inside the array without attenuating high frequencies and allowing for significant noise reduction. A single Tygon array section with a length of 7.5 m and diameter of 38 mm contains 8 transducer elements with a spacing of 75 cm (1 kHz design frequency). Pre-amplifiers and NAS modules are affixed using Vectran and steel wire rope positioned by swaged stops along the strength member. The tow cable length is 100 m with a diameter of 22 mm that is potted to a hose adapter to break out 12 braided copper wire twisted pair conductors and terminates the tow cable Vectran braid. This array in its current state of development is a low-cost alternative to obtain quality acoustic data from a towed array system. Used here for observation of whale vocalizations, this type of array also has many applications in military sonar and seismic surveying. Maintenance on the array can be performed without the use of special facilities or equipment for dehosing and conveniently uses castor oil as an environmentally safe pressure compensating and coupling fluid. Array development including selection of transducers, NAS modules, acoustic acquisition system, array materials and method of construction with results from several deployments will be discussed. We also present beamformed spectrograms containing humpback whale downsweep moans and underwater blowing (bubbles) sounds associated with feeding on sand lance (Ammodytes dubius). © 2019 IEEE.","Acoustics; Array; Signal Processing","3D printers; Acoustic noise; Beamforming; Cables; Commercial off-the-shelf; Data acquisition; Data handling; Differential amplifiers; Digital storage; Fisheries; Global positioning system; Housing; Hydrophones; Laptop computers; Military applications; Ocean currents; Polyurethanes; Remote sensing; Ships; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrographs; Surface mount technology; Transducers; Underwater acoustic communication; Waveguides; Commercial off-the-shelf components; Environmentally safe; Near-real-time processing; Non-acoustic sensors; Pressure compensating; Surface mount device; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Vibration isolation modules; Beam forming networks","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1736749)","The work described in this paper was supported by the National Science Foundation (Division of Ocean Sciences award no. 1736749).","An Advanced Digital Hydrophone Array for Ship Noise Measurements; Barbagelata, Alessandro, Thirty years of towed arrays at NURC, Oceanography, 21, 2, pp. 24-33, (2008); Becker, Kyle M., The ONR five octave research array (FORA) at Penn State, Oceans Conference Record (IEEE), 5, pp. 2607-2610, (2003); Principles of Underwater Sound, (1983); Sherman, Charles H., Transducers and arrays for underwater sound, Transducers and Arrays for Underwater Sound, pp. 1-610, (2007); Williams, Albert J.Iii, Urethane potting of acoustic transducers for acoustic travel-time current meters, International Symposium on Ocean Electronics, SYMPOL, pp. 336-346, (2013); A Guide to Constructing Hydrophone Arrays for Passive Acoustic Data Collection During Nmfs Shipboard Cetacean Surveys, (2013); Wang, Delin, Angular resolution enhancement provided by nonuniformly-spaced linear hydrophone arrays in ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing, Remote Sensing, 9, 10, (2017); Au, Whitlow W.L., Acoustic properties of humpback whale songs, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 120, 2, pp. 1103-1110, (2006); Wang, Delin, Vast assembly of vocal marine mammals from diverse species on fish spawning ground, Nature, 531, 7594, pp. 366-370, (2016)","M.E.

It describes the approaches adopted in measurement, derived from the consideration of the true spherical shape of the Earth, the principal instruments used and the trend to integrate them in a single one, and the various techniques adopted to collect field data according to the goals of the survey, and summarizes some of the fields of application, both in the domain of mapping and in construction and engineering. Surveying is a discipline with a long history, deeply rooted in the description of property and military mapping that has essentially contributed to the development of cartography, and its methods have evolved in parallel with the changes in technology, particularly with the search for a higher accuracy and efficiency. The article outlines some of the future directions, particularly those which are changing the past and current nature of the discipline. However, its key role in the fields of construction and engineering still ensures a prolonged practice using the present techniques. The field of study of surveying is to accurately determine the absolute or relative three-dimensional spatial positions of points and features above, on, or beneath the surface of the Earth, above or below sea level, by measuring the distances and angles between them. The operations of collection, management, fusion, calculation, and analysis of these geographical data are undertaken to reach a graphical representation as a map or plan, or a digital model available to a software application. The mathematical calculation of coordinates is basically performed using the principles of trigonometry by combining the measurements of angles and distances among points. A clear distinction is made between the process of measurement, the survey, and the set of concepts, theory, methods, and techniques which define the discipline of surveying. An increasingly stronger association within the various fields of geomatics—photogrammetry, remote sensing, geographic information systems, and cartography—is observed as the result of the use of common technologies, methods for data processing, and theoretical background. At the same time, other noncartographic applications also make use of the instruments and the techniques developed for surveying, such as manufacturing, structural engineering, architectural visualization, or medical reconstruction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) method with region proposal, e.g. Faster R-CNN, achieves ship detection well. However, for multi-scale target detection in high-resolution remote sensing image, the limitation of accuracy is induced by the region proposal restricted by the training set. Therefore, the mechanism of multi-scale ship detection based on saliency estimation is proposed in our work. Firstly, a saliency estimation algorithm is used to distinguish which image contains large ships and the image pyramid for each input one is established. Then, using a target detection network in different scales of images. The results are merged at the end of network. Finally, accuracy and validity are verified by real data processing. © 2019 IEEE","DCNN; Multi-scale ship detection; Region proposal; Saliency estimation","Convolution; Data handling; Deep neural networks; Remote sensing; Ships; Detection networks; Estimation algorithm; High resolution remote sensing images; Image pyramids; Large ships; Real data processing; Ship detection; Training sets; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Kanjir, Urša, Vessel detection and classification from spaceborne optical images: A literature survey, Remote Sensing of Environment, 207, pp. 1-26, (2018); Ren, Shaoqing, Faster R-CNN: Towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015-January, pp. 91-99, (2015); Ren, Yun, Small object detection in optical remote sensing images via modified Faster R-CNN, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 8, 5, (2018); Kang, Miao, A modified faster R-CNN based on CFAR algorithm for SAR ship detection, RSIP 2017 - International Workshop on Remote Sensing with Intelligent Processing, Proceedings, (2017); Singh, Bharat, An Analysis of Scale Invariance in Object Detection - SNIP, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3578-3587, (2018); Murray, Naila, Saliency estimation using a non-parametric low-level vision model, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 433-440, (2011); Xia, Gui Song, DOTA: A Large-Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3974-3983, (2018); Borji, Ali, Salient Object Detection: A Benchmark, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 24, 12, pp. 5706-5722, (2015)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS)","39th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2019","2019-07-28 through 2019-08-02","Yokohama","154792","21536996","1424412129; 0780312406; 9780780390508; 9798350320107; 9781728163741; 9781424495658; 9781665427920; 9781479911141; 9781479957750; 9781479979295","IGRSE","","English","Dig Int Geosci Remote Sens Symp (IGARSS)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089146833"

At present, the international on-orbit detection of near-celestial bodies and space debris is widespread, that is, the lack of measurement system development and design means, and the lack of data sources. The paper focuses on the principle of space debris on-orbit imaging. Three image information extraction methods and two relative attitude determination methods are proposed. The simulation algorithm of space debris on-orbit imaging is constructed, and the feasibility of the simulation scheme is used. Performance, accuracy, data processing efficiency and other performance were evaluated.

The approach that has been proposed is based on the construction of typical scenarios for model execution. Such scenarios are edited and adapted to the use of alternative electronic terrain maps. The result of scenario operation is a set of data - layers of a digital map based on the input parameters for the model and the problem-solving algorithms, compiled by an expert. That makes it possible to construct libraries of typical scenarios, to store them centralized, as well as provide a common access to the scenarios, and to exchange data among applications. The result of running a scenario is that the user is provided with a possibility, without writing a programming code, to perform complex operations on processing geographical data and to simulate various processes at an electronic terrain map. A geospatial analysis expert system has been developed, containing both the basic functions for geographical data processing and the high-level specialized models. A tree of decisions is built under a mode of visual construction of a problem-solving algorithm. We have implemented a conveyor of operations at which the data sources in an expert system derived when performing any operation are sent to the input of the next operation. The results of this research could be used in simulation models of military activities, the tasks on photogrammetry in designing the optimal routes to fly over a territory, and as an additional tool for analysis of terrain in geoinformation systems. There is a possibility to expand the functionality of an expert system and to add new types of operations. Thus, there is reason to assert that the process of automatic construction of data for digital maps requires specialized software and highly skilled users of geoinformation systems. © 2019 Gregory Drobaha, Vladimir Lisitsin, Lyudmila Safoshkina, Ihor Morozov, Andrey Poberezhnyi.","Digital map; Geoinformation system; Geospatial analysis; Overlay analysis; Simulation model","","","","","","","","Stvorennia Prostorovykh Danykh Dlia Elektronnykh Kart Heoinformatsiynoi Systemy Vnutrishnikh Viysk Mvs Ukrainy Monohrafiya, (2013); Tsourdos, Antonios, Cooperative Path Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Cooperative Path Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (2010); Wessel, Michael A., Flexible software architectures for ontology-based information systems, Journal of Applied Logic, 7, 1, pp. 75-99, (2009); Al-Darwish, Yazid, Predicting the future urban growth and it's impacts on the surrounding environment using urban simulation models: Case study of Ibb city – Yemen, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 57, 4, pp. 2887-2895, (2018); Buffat, René, GIS-based Decision Support System for Building Retrofit, Energy Procedia, 122, pp. 403-408, (2017); Technical Documentation Erdas, (2010); Digital Image Processing, (2002); Arcgis 9, (2004); GIS in the Defence and Intelligence Communities, (2008); Teoriya R Funktsii I Nekotorye Ee Prilozheniya, (1982)","","","Technology Center","","","","","","17293774","","","","English","East.

A comprehensive trafficability forecast requires the analysis of terrain, including slope, land cover and soil properties, and weather, as well as specific vehicle parameters. Terrain and weather interactions were recognized as important for the first time during World War I, when all types of vehicle would frequently bog down in muddy ground. The lessons learned influenced the orientation of future German military geology. During World War II, German military geologists and engineers prepared their first CCM maps. However, these often lacked a consistent format and standardized analysis. During the Cold War, the US Army carried out extensive research to create empirical mobility models based on physical properties and trafficability tests. These results were incorporated into the production of CCM maps. Present day computer-based data processing and analysis have opened up the possibility of enhancements to trafficability forecasting and thus make a vital contribution to providing the armed forces with advice on exercises and operations. © 2019 The Author(s).","","Cold War; computer system; data processing; military application; mobility; prediction; terrain; traffic management; transportation planning; Germany","","","","","","","NATO Reference Mobility Model, (1992); Standard Practice for Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes Unified Soil Classification System, (2006); undefined; Der Volkerkrieg Eine Chronik Der Ereignisse Seit Dem 1 Juli 1914 Dritter Band Erstes Kriegshalbjahr Von Juli 1914 Februar 1915, (1917); Agincourt the King the Campaign the Battle, (2005); Et 148 Next Generation NATO Reference Mobility Model Nrmm Science and Technology Organization Technical Report Et 148, (2016); Development of A Spatial Trafficability Evaluation System, (2003); Taradcom R D Laboratory Tech Rep 12503, (1979); Fields of Battle Terrain in Military History, (2002); Wehrgeologie Im Nordafrikanischen Wustenkrieg 1941 1943, (2003)","F.

Successful ship detection relies on both payload imaging performance and smart onboard data processing techniques. In this study, a multistage ship detection algorithm is proposed, where the spectral, spatial and geometric properties of suspected ships are exploited for effective maritime target mapping. Multispectral images produced by the Landsat OLI and the Sentinel 2 MSI sensors of four locations were used in this study and they present a variety of scenarios that a ship detection algorithm could face. We observed that the NIR and SWIR bands produced a higher number of correctly detected ships when compared to the visible spectral bands and that the spatial resolution had a more significant impact than spectral resolution on true target detection levels. © 2018 IEEE.","satellite images; ship detection; spatial resolution; spectral bandwidth","Coastal zones; Data handling; Image resolution; Observatories; Orbits; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Ships; Signal detection; Spectral resolution; Low earth orbit satellites; Multispectral images; On-board data processing; Satellite images; Ship detection; Situational awareness; Spatial resolution; Spectral bandwidth; Image enhancement","","","","","","","Fundamentals of Satellite Remote Sensing, (2016); McFeeters, S.

Because of its advantages, SVM model has been applied widely in fields of hyperspectral imaging, such as band selection, classification, endmember selection, spectral unmixing, sub-pixel mapping, and anomaly detection.

NASA proposed faster, better, cheaper guidelines for micro-satellites, which have been accepted by more and more international peers. Especially for sudden natural disasters or local military reconnaissance and communication application, it requires low-cost and short lifetime micro-satellites with rapid development, launch and application, which need to change and optimize the development mode of traditional micro-satellite avionics equipment. At the same time, it puts forward quicker satellite integrated testing and in orbit testing, which requires quick system integration and in orbit testing. In order to shorten the time of the payload's data to the users, on-board data processing equipment is employed for small satellite to process payload data in space. Low-cost and short-life micro-satellites bring new requirements for on-board avionics. In order to achieve better, faster and cheaper object in the development of the on-board avionics, we share our lessons learned in the development of on-board avionics for low cost remote sensing micro-satellites, whose life was 1 year. Specifically include:(1)the general requirement of avionics for micro-satellites are summarized, and an integrated avionics system architecture is proposed, including OBC, PCDU, S-Band Transceiver, AIO, GPS receiver, routers and mass memory modules; furthermore, the other function modules are easily integrated in the system.(2) Standardization, modularization and serialization, the general modules of the avionics could be produced in batch mode and stored as off-the-shelf products, the different requirement of satellites were met through the combination of the different standardized modules. In this way, we can avoid repeated development cost and shorten the development cycle. (3) a new way for industry level components selection and quality assurance was explored to reduce the cost of components. The importance of the applied circuits, component level, on-board experience and the orbit altitude was considered. At the same time, the system level fault tolerant design were also strengthened; (4) Plug and play mechanism was put forward to make the OBC recognize the devices dynamically when they powered on, which accelerated the system integration; furthermore, the software modules are also allowed to install and uninstall dynamically on-line for new application requirements; (5)Built-in-test(BIT) methods are employed to shorten the test time during the integration and on-board test. The power-on test and cycle running test was designed, the detailed test could be executed by instruction when needed. The principle prototype avionics for the 1-year life micro-satellite is developed, its volume was 205mm*200mm*200mm, weights 4.5Kg and long term power was 10 watt. The above new technologies and methods are carried out in the development and testing of the prototype, the effectiveness of these techniques are demonstrated. © © 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Spectral imaging technique is often resorted to for accurate abnormal target discrimination due to its high-resolution spectral/spatial information acquisition ability and a great number of data processing methods. Anomaly detection methods for hyperspectral imagery are contrastively studied in this paper. A self-developed visual-band hyperspectral imaging spectrometer is adopted to collect data cubes of certain experimental scene before two kinds of spectral-domain descriptors are used to execute abnormal camouflage detection. Detection effect of information divergence and generalized angle that are utilized as detection descriptors is visually and quantitatively compared and time consumption is assessed. The study is proved to be of significance to meet the anomaly detection demand that is based on spectral signature comparison and can be developed for further detection descriptor study and other imaging techniques beyond spectral imaging. © 2018 SPIE.","Anomaly detection; Generalized angle; Information divergence; Performance analysis; Spectral imaging","Data handling; Military applications; Military electronic countermeasures; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Anomaly detection; Generalized angle; Information divergence; Performance analysis; Spectral imaging; Hyperspectral imaging","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61405134); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD","The authors would like to acknowledge the fund supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (61405134) and Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).","Anomaly Detection Principles and Algorithms, (2017); Imaging Spectrometry Basic Principles and Prospective Applications, (2001); Matteoli, Stefania, A tutorial overview of anomaly detection in hyperspectral images, IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, 25, 7 PART 2, pp. 5-27, (2010); Biblioscholar, (2012); Shi, Zhenwei, RX and its variants for anomaly detection in hyperspectral images, Hongwai yu Jiguang Gongcheng/Infrared and Laser Engineering, 41, 3, pp. 796-802, (2012); Wu, Yiquan, Small target detection in hyperspectral remote sensing image based on adaptive parameter SVM, Guangxue Xuebao/Acta Optica Sinica, 35, 9, (2015); Sabokrou, Mohammad, Deep-Cascade: Cascading 3D Deep Neural Networks for Fast Anomaly Detection and Localization in Crowded Scenes, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 26, 4, pp. 1992-2004, (2017); He, Yuanlei, Anomaly detection for hyperspectral image based on independent component, Guangxue Jishu/Optical Technique, 37, 2, pp. 203-207, (2011); Ding, Qi, A compressed PCA subspace method for anomaly detection in high-dimensional data, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 59, 11, pp. 7419-7433, (2013); Kwon, Heesung, Kernel RX-algorithm: A nonlinear anomaly detector for hyperspectral imagery, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 43, 2, pp. 388-397, (2005)","","Zuo, C.; Yu, Y.; Qian, K.","SPIE spie@spie.org","et al.; Japan Society for Electron Microscopy (JSEM); LIGHTSOFT; Nanjing University of Science and Technology; Orbbec 3D; Sichuan University","6th International Conference on Optical and Photonic Engineering, icOPEN 2018","2018-05-08 through 2018-05-11","Shanghai","138377","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051250488"

The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed an in-house data collection, data analysis and data visualiztion facility, known as the Blue Hub. The Blue Hub operates as a research and development platform for integrated maritime surveillance and maritime situational awareness. It has global coverage and has been applied, for example, to support counter-piracy around Africa, to investigate fishing activity and to monitor the growing ship traffic in the Arctic. In order to improve maritime awareness and support risk assessment, the JRC has started to integrate data from the marine and atmosheric science community. In particular the JRC is interested in using forecasts from operational ocean models and weather models. For the Blue Hub a new type of data server, called ERDDAP, that performs message brokering and data mediation has become an essential tool for the accessing of ocean forecast data as quickly as possible in easy to use formats. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the USA) is making global oceanography and weather data available through the Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program (ERDDAP) data broker. ERDDAP provides RESTful machine to machine communication, data brokering and data mediation by converting data to a number of standard and developer friendly formats, including some Open Geospatial Consortium formats. In this paper, we demonstrate how data brokering and mediation is making complex scientific data accessible. We show how such data is being integrated into the Blue Hub system to enhance maritime situational awareness.","","Risk assessment; Waterway transportation; Environmental researches; European Commission; Machine-to-machine communications; Maritime surveillance; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Open geospatial consortium; Research and development; Situational awareness; Data acquisition; data processing; fishing; forecasting method; integrated approach; machinery; oceanography; research and development; risk assessment; visualization; Africa; Arctic; United States","","","","","","","Posada, Monica, Maritime awareness for counter-piracy in the Gulf of Aden, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), pp. 249-252, (2011); Nrl Review, (2011); Cook, Duncan E., Somali piracy and the monsoon, Weather, Climate, and Society, 5, 4, pp. 309-316, (2013); Erddap the Environmental Research Division S Data Access Program, (2011); undefined; undefined; Maritime Awareness and Risks; undefined; undefined; undefined","","van Proosdij, D.; Millward, H.; Werle, D.","Institute of Physics Publishing michael.roberts@iop.org","ESRI; et al.; NASA; Nova Scotia Community College; PYXIS; Saint Mary's University","9th Symposium of the International Society for Digital Earth, ISDE 2015","2015-10-05 through 2015-10-09","Halifax","122280","17551307","","","","English","IOP Conf.

AR is a branch of computer vision which generally overlays Virtual Objects (VOs) on actual images of real-world scenes in order to provide additional information about the scene to the user. Due to its wide range of applications in the fields of medical, robotics and automotive, geographic and remote sensing, military and aerospace, it has gained high demand. In any AR system, registration is the key to make the augmented scene appearing natural. Registration process must avoid occlusion of VOs and objects in the real world and align the VOs precisely. Optics-based and video-based are two well-known industrial AR systems. Researchers show that even with a single camera model registration for an AR is plausible but, VOs may be registered in front of real-world objects. It is because the registration process lacks depth information of the scene. However, employing stereo vision system and utilizing available natural features in a real-world scene and set of arbitrary multiple planes one can improve accuracy of VO registration. Thus, an AR system becomes robust if it is devised with algorithms to extract and track natural features in real-time. © 2015 IEEE.","2D; 3D virtual object; augmented reality; object registration; stereo-vision","Augmented reality; Computer vision; Image processing; Military applications; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Stereo vision; Depth information; Natural features; Object registration; Real-world objects; Registration process; Single camera model; Stereo vision system; Virtual objects; Stereo image processing","","","","","","","Azuma, Ronald T., A survey of augmented reality, Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 6, 4, pp. 355-385, (1997); Proc Icpr 98, (1998); Uematsu, Yuko, Vision-based registration for augmented reality with integration of arbitrary multiple planes, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3617 LNCS, pp. 155-162, (2005); Shi, Jianbo, Good features to track, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 593-600, (1994); Simon, Gilles, Reconstructing while registering: A novel approach for markerless augmented reality, Proceedings - International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, ISMAR 2002, pp. 285-294, (2002); Hoff, William A., Computer-vision-based registration techniques for augmented reality, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2904, pp. 538-548, (1996); Hung, Yubin, Passive ranging to known planar point sets, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 80-85, (1985); International Conference on Pattern Recognition, (2000); Park, Soon Yong, Real-time 3D registration of stereo-vision based range images using GPU, 2009 Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision, WACV 2009, (2009); Tsai, Roger Y., A Versatile Camera Calibration Technique for High-Accuracy 3D Machine Vision Metrology Using Off-the-Shelf TV Cameras and Lenses, IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation, 3, 4, pp. 323-344, (1987)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","4th IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications, ICSIPA 2015","2015-10-19 through 2015-10-21","Kuala Lumpur","119504","","9781479989966","","","English","IEEE Int.

This study was mainly focused on generating Mesh Model as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Mesh Model is a continues vector model. This new software named ""DemCAD"", contains set of programs which will allow user to input grid data, after that it will performed data processing and analysis, finally a script file will be made, which contains instructions to automatically plot required model. Then user has to run this script file in AutoCAD 2D/3D Environment. This script contains set of commands which will be recorded in particular sequence and pattern, also to get complete DEM in AutoCAD Script file have to run on AutoCAD without interrupting. The most important fact in this study was, Mesh DEM can be used to perform various type 3D Hydrographical analyses, such as Flow Direction Mapping, Flow Accumulation Mapping, Flow Path Tracing, etc. There are software like ArcGIS that have ability to perform Hydrographical analyses for 2D DEMs. In that, input grid data was processed in a specific way then data will be passed to another executable file which will use that data and perform 3D analysis process. In this procedure functions were designed for kernel operations and various kinds of calculations such as calculating distance, Bearing, Interpolate Coordinates, etc. Even though in this study, only land surveying data was used to generate DEMs, any grid format data sources such as Laser Scanning Remote Sensing Data, Radar Data, and even Close Range Photogrammetry stereo pair data, can be used as data sources after some pre-preparation. Future more this mesh model and 3D hydrographic analysis can be used by many professions such as Land Surveying, Quantity Surveying, Irrigation, Engineering, and even military services to plan and perform their day to day work easily.","3D hydrographic analysis; Digital Elevation Model; Script; Software","Computer aided design; Computer software; Data handling; Digital instruments; Geomorphology; Hydrographic surveys; Mapping; Mesh generation; Remote sensing; Surveys; 3D hydrographic analysis; Close range photogrammetry; Data processing and analysis; Designing softwares; Digital elevation model; Engineering surveys; Remote sensing data; Script; Surveying","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; Autocad 2007 Help Menu Inbuilt Offline Help; Digital Elevation Model Technologies and Applications the Dem Users Manual, (2007); undefined; Digital Terrain Modeling Principles and Methodology, (1990)","","","Asian Association on Remote Sensing Sh1939murai@nifty.com","","37th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2016","2016-10-17 through 2016-10-21","Colombo","127201","","9781510834613","","","English","Asian Conf.

High spectral resolution of hyperspectral data can compensate for the comparatively low spatial resolution, which allows for detection and classification of small targets, even below image resolution. Hyperspectral data sets are prone to considerable spectral redundancy, affecting and limiting data processing and algorithm performance. As a consequence, data reduction strategies become increasingly important, especially in view of near-real-time data analysis. The goal of this paper is to analyze different strategies for hyperspectral band selection algorithms and their effect on subpixel classification for different target and background materials. Airborne hyperspectral data is used in combination with linear target simulation procedures to create a representative amount of target-to-background ratios for evaluation of detection limits. Data from two different airborne hyperspectral sensors, AISA Eagle and Hawk, are used to evaluate transferability of band selection when using different sensors. The same target objects were recorded to compare the calculated detection limits. To determine subpixel classification results, pure pixels from the target materials are extracted and used to simulate mixed pixels with selected background materials. Target signatures are linearly combined with different background materials in varying ratios. The commonly used classification algorithms Adaptive Coherence Estimator (ACE) is used to compare the detection limit for the original data with several band selection and data reduction strategies. The evaluation of the classification results is done by assuming a fixed false alarm ratio and calculating the mean target-to-background ratio of correctly detected pixels. The results allow drawing conclusions about specific band combinations for certain target and background combinations. Additionally, generally useful wavelength ranges are determined and the optimal amount of principal components is analyzed. © 2016 SPIE.","Band selection; Detection limit; Dimensionality reduction; Hyperspectral; Simulation; Subpixel; Target detection; Target-to-background ratio","Data handling; Image resolution; Military applications; Object detection; Pixels; Radar target recognition; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Target tracking; Background ratio; Band selection; Detection limits; Dimensionality reduction; HyperSpectral; Simulation; Sub pixels; Data reduction","","","","","","","Gross, Wolfgang, Assessment of target detection limits in hyperspectral data, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 9653, (2015); Kruse, Fred A., The spectral image processing system (SIPS)-interactive visualization and analysis of imaging spectrometer data, Remote Sensing of Environment, 44, 2-3, pp. 145-163, (1993); Jin, Xiaoying, A comparative study of target detection algorithms for hyperspectral imagery, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 7334, (2009); Yu, Lei, Efficient feature selection via analysis of relevance and redundancy, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, pp. 1205-1224, (2004); Keskin, Göksu, Concept of an advanced hyperspectral remote sensing system for pipeline monitoring, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 9644, (2015); Zhang, Aizhu, Optimized hyperspectral band selection using hybrid genetic algorithm and gravitational search algorithm, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 9814, (2015); Chang, Yanglang, Hyperspectral band selection based on parallel particle swarm optimization and impurity function band prioritization schemes, Journal of Applied Remote Sensing, 8, 1, (2014); Cohen, Yuval, Evaluating subpixel target detection algorithms in hyperspectral imagery, Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, (2012); Guanter, Luis, Simulation of optical remote-sensing scenes with application to the EnMAP hyperspectral mission, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 47, 7, pp. 2340-2351, (2009)","W.

Since the visibility of acquired images is often affected by illumination effects (e.g., shadows) it is important to enhance local contrast. For the analysis and comparison of color images depicting the same scene at different time points it is required to compensate color and lightness inconsistencies caused by the different illumination conditions. We have developed an approach for image enhancement and color constancy based on the center/surround Retinex model and the Gray World hypothesis. The combination of the two methods using a color processing function improves color rendition, compared to both methods. The use of stacked integral images (SII) allows to efficiently perform local image processing. Our combined Retinex/Gray World approach has been successfully applied to image sequences acquired on outdoor itineraries at different time points and a comparison with previous Retinex-based approaches has been carried out. © 2016 SPIE.","change detection; color constancy; illumination compensation; Image enhancement","Color; Image enhancement; Image processing; Light reflection; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Change detection; Color constancy; Color processing; Illumination compensation; Illumination conditions; Illumination effect; Local image processing; Situational awareness; Image acquisition","","","","","","","Kong, Hui, Detecting abandoned objects with a moving camera, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 19, 8, pp. 2201-2210, (2010); Schneider, Armin L., Image change detection using a SWIR active imaging system, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 8897, (2013); Jobson, Daniel J., Properties and performance of a center/surround retinex, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 6, 3, pp. 451-462, (1997); Buchsbaum, Gershon, A spatial processor model for object colour perception, Journal of the Franklin Institute, 310, 1, pp. 1-26, (1980); Jobson, Daniel J., A multiscale retinex for bridging the gap between color images and the human observation of scenes, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 6, 7, pp. 965-976, (1997); Bhatia, Amit, Stacked integral image, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 1530-1535, (2010); Image Processing on Line, (2013); Tektonidis, Marco, Hue-preserving local contrast enhancement and illumination compensation for outdoor color images, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 9649, (2015); Barnard, Kobus J., A comparison of computational color constancy algorithms - Part I: Methodology and experiments with synthesized data, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 11, 9, pp. 972-984, (2002); Ahn, Hyunchan, Improving color constancy by saturation weighting, ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings, pp. 1909-1913, (2013)","M.

A vectorization algorithm processing aerial images recently acquired yields an up-to-date road vector data, which are, however, often represented by wriggly, noisy polylines without semantics. The reasons for zigzagged street courses are insufficiencies in the intermediate results of sensor data processing (orthophotos, elevation maps) and occlusions caused by trees, buildings, and others. In the current contribution, an improved computation of geometric attributes will be explained which makes a difference between straight and circular (or elliptic) polylines. Using improved attributes, the candidates for polylines having identical course and sharing a junction are determined. From such candidates, we form chains of polylines. These chains correspond better to the intuitive perception of the term street than the previously used road polylines, because, even after being interrupted by narrower side roads, a chain maintains its label. The generalization of chains with simultaneously adjusting positions of junctions is evidently performed. We apply a generalization with the purpose-based modification of a well-known polyline simplification algorithm once chain-wise and once polyline-wise in order to show-by means of qualitative results-the advantages of the chain-wise generalization. © 2016 SPIE.","Dominant direction; Road database; Urban terrain; Vectoriaztion","Chains; Data handling; Military applications; Remote sensing; Roads and streets; Semantics; Trees (mathematics); Urban planning; Dominant direction; Geometric attributes; Intermediate results; Sensor data processing; Simplification algorithms; Urban terrain; Vectoriaztion; Vectorization algorithm; Transportation","","","","","","","Wegner, Jan Dirk, Road networks as collections of minimum cost paths, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 108, pp. 128-137, (2015); International Archives of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, (2004); Mena, Juan B., Automatic vectorization of segmented road networks by geometrical and topological analysis of high resolution binary images, Knowledge-Based Systems, 19, 8, pp. 704-718, (2006); Clode, Simon P., Detection and vectorization of roads from lidar data, Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 73, 5, pp. 517-535, (2007); Proceedings Lc3d Workshop, (2012); Canadian Cartographer, (1973); Steger, Carsten T., An unbiased detector of curvilinear structures, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 20, 2, pp. 113-125, (1998); Bulatov, Dimitri, Vectorization of road data extracted from aerial and UAV imagery, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 41, pp. 567-574, (2016); Ester, Martin, A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise, Proceedings - 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 1996, pp. 226-231, (1996); Tsai, Duming, A fast thresholding selection procedure for multimodal and unimodal histograms, Pattern Recognition Letters, 16, 6, pp. 653-666, (1995)","","Esch, T.; Erbertseder, T.; Chrysoulakis, N.","SPIE spie@spie.org","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications for Urban Environments","2016-09-26 through 2016-09-27","Edinburgh","125820","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010858499"

A combined active and passive optical measurement system using a single telescope mount is presented which performs precise ranging measurements of retro reflector equipped objects in low earth orbit (LEO). The German Aerospace Center (DLR) runs an observatory in Stuttgart where a system has been assembled completely from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The visible light directed to the tracking camera is used to perform angular measurements of objects under investigation. This is done astrometrically by comparing the apparent target position with cataloged star positions. First successful satellite laser ranging was demonstrated recently using an optical fiber directing laser pulses onto the astronomical mount. The transmitter operates at a wavelength of 1064 nm with a repetition rate of 3 kHz and pulse energy of 25 μJ. A motorized tip/tilt mount allows beam steering of the collimated beam with μrad accuracy. The returning photons reflected from the object in space are captured with the tracking telescope. A special low aberration beam splitter unit was designed to separate the infrared from visible light. This allows passive optical closed loop tracking and operation of a single photon detector for time of flight measurements at a single telescope simultaneously. The presented innovative design yields to a compact and cost effective but very precise ranging system which allows orbit determination. © 2016 SPIE.","fiber; laser transmitter; low earth orbit; optical telescope; satellite laser ranging; single photon detector; space debris; space situational awareness","Angle measurement; Avalanche photodiodes; Communication satellites; Cost effectiveness; Earth (planet); Fibers; Geodetic satellites; Light; Optical data processing; Optical fibers; Optical telescopes; Orbits; Particle beams; Photodetectors; Photons; Pulse repetition rate; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space debris; Space optics; Systems engineering; Transmitters; Laser transmitters; Low earth orbits; Satellite laser ranging; Single-photon detectors; Space situational awareness; Tracking (position)","","","","","","","Hampf, Daniel, First successful satellite laser ranging with a fibre-based transmitter, Advances in Space Research, 58, 4, pp. 498-504, (2016); Wagner, Paul, Passive optical space surveillance system for initial leo object detection, Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC, 4, pp. 2594-2600, (2015); Ceas Space Journal, (2015); Hampf, Daniel, Optical technologies for observation of low Earth orbit objects, Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC, 3, pp. 2101-2108, (2014); Satellite Laser Ranging in the 1990s Report of the 1994 Belmont Workshop, (1994); Ssa Conference 2006, (2006); Initial Detection and Tracking of Objects in Low Earth Orbit, (2016); Norad Two Line Element Sets Current Data; undefined; Optische Einrichtung Strahlteiler Fur Instrumente Mit Optischer Vergroerung, (2015)","","Puschell, J.J.; Ardanuy, P.E.","SPIE spie@spie.org","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Remote Sensing System Engineering VI","2016-08-31 through 2016-09-01","San Diego","125280","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007008129"

There are several areas, where the scanned 3D point clouds can be used very efficiently. In our study we review the potential applications of LiDAR data in military historical reconstruction. Obviously, the base of this kind of investigation must be the archive data, but it is an interesting challenge to integrate a cutting edge method into such tasks. The LiDAR technology can be very useful, especially in vegetation covered areas, where the conventional remote sensing technologies are mostly inefficient. We review two typical sample projects where we integrated LiDAR data in military historical GIS reconstruction. Finally, we summarize, how laser scanned data can support the different parts of reconstruction work and define the technological steps of LiDAR data processing.","Archaeology; GIS; Lidar; Military historical reconstruction; Remote sensing","Data fusion; Data handling; Geographic information systems; History; Military applications; Optical radar; 3D point cloud; Archaeology; Cutting edges; Historical reconstruction; Laser scanned; Remote sensing technology; Remotely sensed data; Typical samples; Remote sensing","","","","","","","Regi Idok Uj Modszerek Roncsolasmentes Regeszet Baranya Megyeben 2005 2013 Old Times New Methods Non Invasive Archaeology in Baranya County Hungary 2005 2013, (2014); Local Relief Model Lrm Toolbox for Arcgis, (2014); Draganits, Erich, The late Nordic Iron Age and Viking Age royal burial site of Borre in Norway: ALS- and GPR-based landscape reconstruction and harbour location at an uplifting coastal area, Quaternary International, 367, pp. 96-110, (2015); Evans, Damian H., Uncovering archaeological landscapes at Angkor using lidar, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 31, pp. 12595-12600, (2013); A Pecs Melletti Jakabhegy Oskori Foldvar Lidar Adatainak Regeszeti Celu Kiertekelese Es Terinformatikai Integralasa, (2014); Archaeological Debates, (2012); Juhász, A., A special GIS application - Military historical reconstruction, Periodica Polytechnica Civil Engineering, 51, 1, pp. 25-31, (2007); Aarms Academic and Applied Research in Military and Public Management Science, (2015); Lezerszkenneles, (2012); 30th Earsel Symposium Remote Sensing for Science Education and Culture, (2010)","A.

Use of UAVs is currently experiencing tremendous growth, primarily in military and homeland security applications. It is only a matter of time until UAVs will be widely accepted as platforms for implementing monitoring/surveillance and inspection in other fields. Most UAVs already have payloads as well as hardware/software capabilities to incorporate a number of non-contact remote sensors, such as high resolution cameras, multi-spectral imaging systems, and laser ranging systems (LIDARs). of critical importance to realizing the potential of UAVs within the infrastructure realm is to establish how (and the extent to which) such information may be used to inform preservation and renewal decisions. Achieving this will depend both on our ability to quantify information from images (through, for example, optical metrology techniques) and to fuse data from the array of non-contact sensing systems. Through a series of applications to both laboratory-scale and field implementations on operating infrastructure, this paper will present and evaluate (through comparison with conventional approaches) various image processing and data fusion strategies tailored specifically for the assessment of highway bridges.

The instrument is being developed by a European industrial consortium under ESA GSTP contract. The onboard data handling system is made for realtime data processing, enabling Level-2 generation onboard and therefore drastically reducing the amount of data to be downloaded and processed. It is designed to be operated upon nano- (such as CubeSats) or micro-satellites, or also on board larger platforms. The instrument will have unprecedented low mass and low power consumption. This hyperspectral imager will achieve a performance level high enough to reliably accomplish the tasks of early warnings via change detection monitoring, providing situational awareness to the end user The target platform of the current study is a 3U CubeSat, where 1U is dedicated to the HyperCube accommodation. The possibility of fitting within the cubic centimeter order of magnitude is provided by the state-of-art and extremely lightweighted reflective optics and telescope design operating in the VNIR range, made possible thanks to new technologies and materials, such as single point diamond turning and RSA aluminum. The signal-to-noise ratio, the spectral resolution, the ground sampling distance and the spectral bandwidth are sufficient for early warning of many natural events, e.g. flooding, forest fires, landslides, stress on vegetation. Furthermore, any other variation of the soil spectral signature, as for example illegal dumps, can also be detected. If used onboard larger satellites, the very wide swath, the L2 realtime data processing and the minimal impact at system level make the HyperCube attractive as an ancillary instrument providing real time phenomena information either to the larger primary payload or to a ground control room. This enables smart operational planning for large payloads. © 2015 IEEE.","cubesat; early warning; hyperspectral; remote sensing","Data handling; Deforestation; Geometry; Micro satellites; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Signal to noise ratio; Small satellites; Spectroscopy; Change detection monitoring; Early warning; Ground sampling distances; HyperSpectral; Onboard data handling; Real-time data processing; Single point diamond turning; Situational awareness; Radar target recognition; Data Processing; Energy Consumption; Instruments; Remote Sensing","","","","","","","NASA Earth Data; undefined; undefined","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE AESS; IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","2nd IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for Aerospace, MetroAeroSpace 2015","2015-06-03 through 2015-06-05","Benevento","113895","","9781479975693","","","English","IEEE Int.

With the development of remote sensing technology, more and more remote sensing data are accumulated and stored in the cloud. An effective way for cloud users to access and analyse these massive spatiotemporal data in the web clients becomes an urgent issue. In this paper, we proposed a new scalable, interactive and web-based cloud computing solution for massive remote sensing data analysis. We build a spatiotemporal analysis platform to provide the end-user with a safe and convenient way to access massive remote sensing data stored in the cloud. The lightweight cloud storage system used to store public data and users' private data is constructed based on open source distributed file system. In it, massive remote sensing data are stored as public data, while the intermediate and input data are stored as private data. The elastic, scalable, and flexible cloud computing environment is built using Docker, which is a technology of open-source lightweight cloud computing container in the Linux operating system. In the Docker container, open-source software such as IPython, NumPy, GDAL, and Grass GIS etc., are deployed. Users can write scripts in the IPython Notebook web page through the web browser to process data, and the scripts will be submitted to IPython kernel to be executed. By comparing the performance of remote sensing data analysis tasks executed in Docker container, KVM virtual machines and physical machines respectively, we can conclude that the cloud computing environment built by Docker makes the greatest use of the host system resources, and can handle more concurrent spatial-temporal computing tasks. Docker technology provides resource isolation mechanism in aspects of IO, CPU, and memory etc., which offers security guarantee when processing remote sensing data in the IPython Notebook. Users can write complex data processing code on the web directly, so they can design their own data processing algorithm.","","","","","","","","","Blower, Jonathan D., GIS in the cloud: Implementing a Web Map Service on Google App Engine, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, (2010); Science and Society, (2008); Cary, Ariel, Experiences on processing spatial data with mapreduce, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 5566 LNCS, pp. 302-319, (2009); Cui, Dong, Massive spatial data processing model based on cloud computing model, 3rd International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization, CSO 2010: Theoretical Development and Engineering Practice, 2, pp. 347-350, (2010); Deelman, Ewa, The cost of doing science on the cloud: The montage example, 2008 SC - International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, SC 2008, (2008); Wagging the Long Tail of Earth Science Why We Need an Earth Science Data Web and how to Build It, (2012); Hansen, Matthew C., High-resolution global maps of 21st-century forest cover change, Science, 342, 6160, pp. 850-853, (2013); Shen, Helen, Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code, Nature, 515, 7525, pp. 151-152, (2014); Huang, Qunying, Cloud computing for Geosciences: Deployment of GEOSS Clearinghouse on Amazon's EC2, Proceedings of the ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on High Performance and Distributed Geographic Information Systems, ACM SIGSPATIAL HPDGIS 2010, pp. 35-38, (2010); Karimi, Hassan Ali, Exploring Real-Time Geoprocessing in Cloud Computing: Navigation Services Case Study, Transactions in GIS, 15, 5, pp. 613-633, (2011)","J.H.

Thus, polarimetric SAR has become a key issue in development. Polarimetric SAR technologies have made significant progress in applications such as military and civil remote sensing. However, because of the limitation of coherent imaging, speckle in SAR and polarimetric SAR data seriously affects the relative information extraction. Therefore, speckle suppression is an important step in SAR and polarimetric SAR data processing. Subsequent applications with polarimetric SAR data could be supported. The Bilateral Filter (BF) that combines spatial closeness and gray similarity to suppress speckle is an excellent edge preservation filtering algorithm. This paper proposes an Improved Cross Bilateral Filter (ICBF) to resolve the deficiency of the BF in speckle suppression of polar metric SAR data. The reference image was imported to improve the gray similarity measurement accuracy of the original data, and a new strategy that sets two key parameters of bilateral filter based on the variance coefficient of filter window was presented to adapt to the change in the homogeneity degree of the filter window. The ICBF added scattering mechanism measurement to extend the original weight kernel, adjusted spatial closeness variance via the local coefficient of variation by using SPAN image, and measured the similarity of gray value and scattering mechanism by using a reference image. The experiment was conducted with AIRSAR polar metric data in the San Francisco region. The proposed filter algorithm was then compared with classic filter algorithms, such as Boxcar, IDAN, and Refined Lee, based on speckle suppression, detailed information preservation, scattering and polarization information preservation with the visual and index methods. The experimental results show that ICBF could improve the gray similarity measurement accuracy of the original data and that ICBF can suppress speckle and preserve detailed information, such as point targets and edges in the original data, better than the classic filter algorithms. By contrast, the measurement of scattering mechanism was combined in the kernel function of bilateral filter, the parameter of the space distance weight was obtained from SPAN image, and the weights of gray value and scattering mechanism were measured with the standard deviation of the corresponding data. Thus, the polarization information and scattering characteristics of the original data were preserved well. Compared with classic filtering algorithms, the ICBF can smooth noise and preserve detailed information better. Furthermore, polarization information and scattering characteristics of the original data are maintained to support subsequent application based on polarimetric SAR data. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Images acquired in bad weather, such as haze and fog, are seriously degraded by the scatting of the atmosphere, which makes the image color gray, reduces the contrast and makes the object features difficult to identify. The bad weather not only leads to the variation of the visual effect of the image, but also cause the disadvantage of the post processing to the image, as well as inconvenience of all kinds of instruments which rely on optical imaging, such as satellite remote sensing system, aerial photo system, outdoor monitoring system and object identification system. That is the reason why the image need enhancement and restoration for the improvement of the visual effects and convenience of post processing. This paper sums up two kinds of image dehazing methods, which are the methods based on image enhancement and based on the physics model. After that, some algorithms and research results are presented, followed by quantitative and qualitative evaluations of these techniques.

In the brown-coal basin, the open-pit mines and the heavy/chemical industry have completely changed the shape of the georelief, including hydrographic networks, land-use and settlement. The neighboring Ore Mountains are victims of settlement extinction caused by the political situation after the Second World War and huge water dam constructions. In this paper different methods for preserving the changes that have been occurred in this region. The methods include historical data processing, modelling, reconstructions, analysis and visualizations. Historical data preprocessing is a very important part of the project as it influences the overall quality of all the results. Different methods for old maps, georeferencing, and aerial imagery processing and digital terrain models derivation were tested and used throughout the project. Data supporting the research were obtained directly in the field using the KAP (Kite Aerial Photography) and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) technology. The task concerning modelling and reconstruction is based on data derived from defined time-line of processed data—here we covered the period from 1720 up to nowadays. The results of this part of the project are high quality digital terrain models derived for different time periods, hydrological network reconstructions, land-use development, and extinct settlement 3D reconstructions. Analysis and visualization was performed within the GIS environment. All the processed data are published using the ArcGIS for Server technology offering data visualizations and basic analysis to the public within the Internet. The information system resulting from this project will offer a comprehensive source of processed historical data for other scientific usages and for preserving the cultural heritage of this region for further generations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Analysis; Extinct landscape; North-West Bohemia; Reconstruction; Visualization","Aerial photography; Antennas; Coal industry; Coal mines; Data handling; Data visualization; Flow visualization; Historic preservation; Image reconstruction; Land use; Landforms; Maps; Military operations; Open pit mining; Repair; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Visualization; Analysis; Cultural heritages; Digital terrain model; Extinct landscape; Hydrographic networks; Network reconstruction; North-West Bohemia; UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle); Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","(DF12P01OVV043)","This work was supported by the Czech Ministry of Culture through the NAKI programme “Landscape Reconstruction and Vanished Municipalities Database for Preserving the Cultural Heritage in the Region of Ústí nad Labem” no.

In the military field, the automatic detection of ships can be used to monitor ship dynamic in the harbor and maritime of enemy, and then analyze the enemy naval power. In civilian field, the automatic detection of ships can be used in monitoring transportation of harbor and illegal behaviors such as illegal fishing, smuggling and pirates, etc. In recent years, research of ship detection is mainly concentrated in three categories: forward-looking infrared images, downward-looking SAR image, and optical remote sensing images with sea background. Little research has been done into ship detection of optical remote sensing images with harbor background, as the gray-scale and texture features of ships are similar to the coast in high-resolution optical remote sensing images. In this paper, we put forward an effective harbor ship target detection method. First of all, in order to overcome the shortage of the traditional difference method in obtaining histogram valley as the segmentation threshold, we propose an iterative histogram valley segmentation method which separates the harbor and ships from the water quite well. Secondly, as landing ships in optical remote sensing images usually lead to discontinuous harbor edges, we use Hough Transform method to extract harbor edges. First, lines are detected by Hough Transform. Then, lines that have similar slope are connected into a new line, thus we access continuous harbor edges. Secondary segmentation on the result of the land-and-sea separation, we eventually get the ships. At last, we calculate the aspect ratio of the ROIs, thereby remove those targets which are not ship. The experiment results show that our method has good robustness and can tolerate a certain degree of noise and occlusion. © Copyright 2015 SPIE.","histogram valley segmentation; Hough Transform; inshore ship detection; minimum enclosing rectangle; Optical remote sensing images","Aspect ratio; Crime; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Hough transforms; Image analysis; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Infrared imaging; Iterative methods; Landforms; Optical data processing; Optical resolving power; Radar imaging; Service vessels; Ships; Synthetic aperture radar; Automatic Detection; Forward looking infrared images; Minimum enclosing rectangle; Optical remote sensing; Segmentation methods; Segmentation threshold; Ship detection; Water transportation; Remote sensing","","","","","","","Greidanus, Harm, Benchmarking operational SAR ship detection, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 6, pp. 4215-4218, (2004); Corbane, Christina, Fully automated procedure for ship detection using optical satellite imagery, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 7150, (2008); Corbane, Christina, A complete processing chain for ship detection using optical satellite imagery, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 31, 22, pp. 5837-5854, (2010); Deng, Chunhua, Ship detection from optical satellite image using optical flow and saliency, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 8921, (2013); Pérez, Arnulfo, An Iterative Thresholding Algorithm for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, PAMI-9, 6, pp. 742-751, (1987); Rosenfeld, Azriel, Histogram Concavity Analysis as an Aid in Threshold Selection, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-13, 2, pp. 231-235, (1983); Liu, Ge, A new method on inshore ship detection in high-resolution satellite images using shape and context information, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 11, 3, pp. 617-621, (2013); Xu, Jian, An invariant generalized Hough transform based method of inshore ships detection, 2011 International Symposium on Image and Data Fusion, ISIDF 2011, (2011); Method and Means for Recognizing Complex Patterns, (1962)","","Yang, W.; Shen, C.; Liu, H.","SPIE spie@spie.org","Chinese Society for Optical Engineering","Applied Optics and Photonics, China: Image Processing and Analysis, AOPC 2015","2015-05-05 through 2015-05-07","Beijing","117481","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963543422"

However, most of the popular techniques for airport detection from optical remote sensing images have three weaknesses: 1) Due to the characteristics of optical images, the detection results are often affected by imaging conditions, like weather situation and imaging distortion; and 2) optical images contain comprehensive information of targets, so that it is difficult for extracting robust features (e.g., intensity and textural information) to represent airport area; 3) the high resolution results in large data volume, which makes real-time processing limited. Most of the previous works mainly focus on solving one of those problems, and thus, the previous methods cannot achieve the balance of performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine airport detection framework to solve aforementioned three issues using wavelet coefficients. The framework includes two stages: 1) an efficient wavelet-based feature extraction is adopted for multi-scale textural feature representation, and support vector machine(SVM) is exploited for classifying and coarsely deciding airport candidate region; and then 2) refined line segment detection is used to obtain runway and landing field of airport. Finally, airport recognition is achieved by applying the fine runway positioning to the candidate regions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of detection accuracy and processing efficiency. © 2015 SPIE.","Airport detection; Optical image processing; Wavelet transform","Airports; Feature extraction; Geometrical optics; Image analysis; Image reconstruction; Military applications; Military photography; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Traffic control; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Airport detections; Comprehensive information; Line segment detection; Optical image processing; Optical remote sensing; Textural information; Wavelet coefficients; Wavelet-based Feature; Image processing","","","","","","","Pi, Yiming, Airport Detection and Runway Recognition in SAR Images, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 6, pp. 4007-4009, (2003); Huertas, Andrés, Detecting runways in complex airport scenes, Computer Vision, Graphics, & Image Processing, 51, 2, pp. 107-145, (1990); Sun, Kaiming Min, Edge-preserve image smoothing algorithm based on convexity model and its application in the airport extraction, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6752, PART 1, (2007); Yan, Chen, Automatic recognition of airport in remote sensing images based on improved methods, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6786, (2007); Zöngür, Ugur, Airport runway detection in satellite images by Adaboost Learning, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 7477, (2009); Infrared Laser Eng, (2006); Liu, Dehong, Airport detection in large aerial optical imagery, ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings, 5, pp. V-761-V-764, (2004); Qu, Yanyun, Airport detection base on support vector machine from a single image, 2005 Fifth International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing, 2005, pp. 546-548, (2005); Bhagavathy, Sitaram, Modeling and detection of geospatial objects using texture motifs, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 44, 12, pp. 3706-3715, (2006); Aytekin, Örsan, Texture-based airport runway detection, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 10, 3, pp. 471-475, (2013)","","Yang, W.; Shen, C.; Liu, H.","SPIE spie@spie.org","Chinese Society for Optical Engineering","Applied Optics and Photonics, China: Image Processing and Analysis, AOPC 2015","2015-05-05 through 2015-05-07","Beijing","117481","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963532796"

As a key technique, small target detection based on infrared image plays an important role. However, infrared targets have their own characteristics, such as target size variation, which make the detection work quite difficult. In practical application, the target size may vary due to many reasons, such as optic angle of sensors, imaging distance, environment and so on. For conventional detection methods, it is difficult to detect such size-varying targets, especially when the backgrounds have strong clutters. This paper presents a novel method to detect size-varying infrared targets in a cluttered background. It is easy to find that the target region is salient in infrared images. It means that target region have a signature of discontinuity with its neighboring regions and concentrates in a relatively small region, which can be considered as a homogeneous compact region, and the background is consistent with its neighboring regions. Motivated by the saliency feature and gradient feature, we introduce minimum target intensity (MTI) to measure the dissimilarity between different scales, and use mean gradient to restrict the target scale in a reasonable range. They are integrated to be multiscale MTI filter. The proposed detection method is designed based on multiscale MTI filter. Firstly, salient region is got by morphological low-pass filtering, where the potential target exists in. Secondly, the candidate target regions are extracted by multiscale minimum target intensity filter, which can effectively give the optimal target size. At last, signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) is used to segment targets, which is computed based on optimal scale of candidate targets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve both higher detection precision and robustness in complex background. © 2015 SPIE.","Infrared search and track; Scale space; Size-varying target; Target detection","Clutter (information theory); Infrared imaging; Low pass filters; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Signal processing; Space optics; Target tracking; Tracking (position); Cluttered backgrounds; Complex background; Conventional detection; Detection precision; Infrared search and track; Scale spaces; Signal-to-clutter ratios; Small target detection; Image processing","","","","","","","Sui, Xiubao, Detection algorithm of targets for infrared search system based on area infrared focal plane array under complicated background, Optik, 123, 3, pp. 235-239, (2012); Dong, Xiabin, Infrared dim and small target detecting and tracking method inspired by Human Visual System, Infrared Physics and Technology, 62, pp. 100-109, (2014); Yilmaz, Alper, Target tracking in airborne forward looking infrared imagery, Image and Vision Computing, 21, 7 SPEC., pp. 623-635, (2003); Khan, Jesmin Farzana, Target detection in cluttered forward-looking infrared imagery, Optical Engineering, 44, 7, pp. 1-8, (2005); Jong, Arie N.De, IRST and its perspective, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2552, 1, pp. 206-213, (1995); Missirian, Jean Michel, IRST: A key system in modern warfare, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 3061, pp. 554-565, (1997); Kim, Sungho, Target attribute-based false alarm rejection in small infrared target detection, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 8537, (2012); Zhang, Wei, Algorithms for optical weak small targets detection and tracking: Review, Proceedings of 2003 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing, ICNNSP'03, 1, pp. 643-647, (2003); Tartakovsky, Alexander G., Adaptive sequential algorithms for detecting targets in a heavy IR clutter, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 3809, pp. 119-130, (1999); Tartakovsky, Alexander G., Effective adaptive spatial-temporal technique for clutter rejection in IRST, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 4048, pp. 85-95, (2000)","","Bruzzone, L.","SPIE spie@spie.org","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXI","2015-09-21 through 2015-09-23","Toulouse","117612","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961644260"

The new class of hyper-spectral cameras opens broad possibilities of its utilization for military and industry purposes. Indeed, such cameras are able to classify materials as well as detect and track spectral signatures continuously in real time while simultaneously providing an operator the benefit of enhanced-discrimination-color video. Supporting these extensive capabilities requires significant computational processing of the collected spectral data. In general, two processing streams are envisioned for mosaic array cameras. The first is spectral computation that provides essential spectral content analysis e.g. detection or classification. The second is presentation of the video to an operator that can offer the best display of the content depending on the performed task e.g. providing spatial resolution enhancement or color coding of the spectral analysis. These processing streams can be executed in parallel or they can utilize each other's results. The spectral analysis algorithms have been developed extensively, however demosaicking of more than three equally-sampled spectral bands has been explored scarcely. We present unique approach to demosaicking based on multi-band super-resolution and show the trade-off between spatial resolution and spectral content.

We study sensor concepts, UAVs suitable for carrying the sensors, and signal processing for mapping and target detection applications. We also perform user studies together with the Swedish armed forces (SwAF), to evaluate usage in their mission cycle and interviews to clarify how to present data. Two ladar sensor concepts for mounting in UAV are studied. The discussion is based on known performance in commercial ladar systems today and predicted performance in future UAV applications. The small UAV is equipped with a short-range scanning ladar. The system is aimed for real-time situational analysis of small areas and for documentation of situations. The large UAV is equipped with a high-performing photon counting ladar with array detector. Its purpose is to support large-area surveillance, intelligence and mapping operations. Based on these sensors and their performance, signal and image processing support for data analysis is analyzed. Generated data amounts are estimated and demands on data storage capacity and data transfer is analyzed. The usage of 3D mapping have been tested together with the SwAF, where 3D maps was used in the planning phase and as last-minute intelligence update of the target area. Feedback from these tests are presented. Interviews with various military professions are performed, to get better understanding of how 3D data are used and interpreted. Approaches of how to present data from 3D imaging sensors for users are also discussed.","3D data; mapping; target detection; UAV","Data transfer; Digital storage; Image processing; Mapping; Optical data processing; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Signal processing; Target tracking; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 3D data; Array detectors; Data storage capacity; Large-area surveillance; Predicted performance; Sensor concepts; Signal and image processing; Swedish armed forces; Data handling","","","","","","","Andersson, Dennis, F-REX: Event driven synchronized multimedia model visualization, Proceedings: DMS 2009 - 15th International Conference on Distributed Multimedia Systems, pp. 140-145, (2009); Aulinas, Josep, The SLAM problem: A survey, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, 184, 1, pp. 363-371, (2008); Bird, Alan W., Small SWAP 3D imaging flash ladar for small tactical unmanned air systems, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 9460, January, (2015); Bissmarck, Fredrik, Efficient algorithms for Next Best View evaluation, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2015-December, pp. 5876-5883, (2015); Chao, Haiyang, A comparative evaluation of low-cost IMUs for unmanned autonomous systems, IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems, pp. 211-216, (2010); Chevalier, Tomas R., Performance of laser penetration through forest vegetation, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6550, (2007); Connolly, C.

This often causes additional time delays besides technical constraints such as weather and limited aircraft availability for airborne campaigns. Of course the geospatial data quality is an important issue for many applications. The increasing demand of geospatial data nowadays consequently requires high resolution datasets as well as a sufficient level of accuracy. Therefore an integration of different technologies is required in many cases to gain the expected result especially in the context of disaster preparedness and emergency response. Another important issue in this context is the fast delivery of relevant data which is expressed by the term ""Rapid Mapping"". In this paper we present first results of an on-going research to integrate different data sources like space borne radar and optical platforms. Initially the orthorectification of Very High Resolution Satellite (VHRS) imagery i.e. SPOT-6 has been done as a continuous process to the DEM generation using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data. The role of Ground Control Points (GCPs) from GNSS surveys is mandatory in order to fulfil geometrical accuracy. In addition, this research aims on providing suitable processing algorithm of space borne data for large scale topographical mapping as described in section 3.2. Recently, radar space borne data has been used for the medium scale topographical mapping e.g. for 1:50.000 map scale in Indonesian territories. The goal of this on-going research is to increase the accuracy of remote sensing data by different activities, e.g. the integration of different data sources (optical and radar) or the usage of the GCPs in both, the optical and the radar satellite data processing. Finally this results will be used in the future as a reference for further geospatial data acquisitions to support topographical mapping in even larger scales up to the 1:10.000 map scale.","Accuracy; GCP; Orthorectification; Radargrammetry; Stereo; Topography","Data integration; Disaster prevention; Fighter aircraft; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Satellite imagery; Space platforms; Space-based radar; Stereo image processing; Accuracy; Data-source; Geo-spatial data; Ground control points; Large-scales; Optical-; Ortho-rectification; Radargrammetry; Space-borne; Stereo; Mapping","","","","","","","Breit, Helko, Bistatic and interferometric processing of TanDEM-X Data, Proceedings of the European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar, EUSAR, 2012-April, pp. 93-96, (2012); Tandem X Ground Segment Dem Products Specification Document, (2016); Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards Part 3 National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy, (1998); Zebker, Howard A., Accuracy of Topographic Maps Derived from ERS-1 Interferometric Radar, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 32, 4, pp. 823-836, (1994); Living Planet Symposium, (2010); International Conference of Applied Geoinformatics for Society and Environment Agse, (2012); Data Users Guide 5 Digital Elevation Models, (1993)","W.

This novel combination of new and existing technologies to fully automate and stream DLR allows the ISO and Oncor to utilize the actual real time transmission line capacity to enhance asset optimization and optimize generation dispatch which leads to reduced congestion, increased reliability and heightened Wide-Area System Awareness (WASA). By completely automating the process, Oncor's Dynamic Line Rating project, a cost-sharing Smart Grid Demonstration Project (SGDP) with the United States Department of Energy, achieved this breakthrough without adding to the workload of its grid operators in the system control center. Dynamic Line Rating means several things to the industry. Some refer to any line ratings which change during their application as Dynamic Line Ratings, e.g., when the ratings are adjusted for ambient temperature, seasonal changes, or day versus night. In the context of this documentation, Dynamic Line Ratings (DLR) refers to line ratings that reflect the impact of all weather conditions impinging on the conductor in real time. Further, we are referring to the ratings as integrated Dynamic Line Rating (iDLR) since the DLR rating process has been completely integrated and automated from remote sensors on the conductor to the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch real time operations in the wholesale electricity market. The transparent integration of the integrated Dynamic Line Ratings into the posted grid telemetry provided to the ISO for operations has maintained high reliability and availability throughout the twentyfour month period it has been in operation. An internal auditing and validation logic system within the data processing protocol verifies that the ratings are within safe limits and that there is sufficient data for using the iDLR. If the system identifies any issues with the data, the system automatically reverts to the standard rating protocol, which for Oncor is an ambient temperature adjusted rating, and sends an alert to a designated operations support desk for assessment and resolution. Oncor's system operations and control room personnel are not required to take any intervening or corrective actions in the process. The ratings are then provided in telemetry to the ISO where they are automatically processed every five minutes by SCED. The benefits of this implementation include an increase in transmission line capacity of up to 25%. The increase in capacity mitigates congestion, reduces the penalty costs of congestion, and increases the optimal dispatch of generation, all of which have large economic savings potential to market participants and the eventual rate payers. The increased capacity can also be applied to planning decisions where both timing and a least regrets deployment of capital are essential. For example, iDLR can be an effective tool to rapidly and effectively serve incremental capacity needs while minimizing the potential for stranded assets in the future. iDLR can also be used to accelerate needed new construction by increasing the transmission capacity of other lines needed to support construction outages due to its short lead-time. In addition to demonstrating the accuracy, robustness and reliability of the installed units, a number of detailed assessments of the technology were performed ranging from deployment requirements to economic impact. For example, an optimization study was performed to determine the minimum number of devices required on a line segment to maintain a given rating accuracy. Also, an assessment of the impact of increased line capacity on the congestion experienced by a target group of lines and peripheral lines adjacent to the target lines was performed. This assessment identified the economic impact of different percentages of increased capacity on the target/and peripheral lines' congestion and how to transpose that approximation to a system-wide deployment of DLR. The reliability, accuracy and economic value of iDLR were well established in the development/demonstration project which led to the decision to deploy the same iDLR system to five additional lines in 2013 in order to provide added capacity in a region of the grid experiencing expansive and rapid load growth. © 2014 CIGRE.

The ability to photonically power remote systems opens up the full range of electrical sensors. Power-over-fiber is an attractive option in electromagnetically sensitive environments, particularly for longterm, maintenance-free applications. It can deliver uninterrupted power sufficient for elaborate sensors, data processing or even actuators alongside continuous high speed data communication for remote sensor application. This paper proposes an active photonic sensor communication system, which combines the advantages of optical data links in terms of immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI), high bandwidth, hardiness against tampering or eavesdropping, and low cable weight with the robustness one has come to expect from industrial or military electrical connectors. An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is presented that implements a closed-loop regulation of the sensor power supply to guarantee continuous, reliable data communications while maintaining a highly efficient, adaptive sensor supply scheme. It is demonstrated that the resulting novel photonic sensor communication cable can handle sensors and actuators differing orders of magnitude with respect to power consumption. The miniaturization of the electro-optical converters and driving electronics is as important to the presented development as the energy efficiency of the detached, optically powered sensor node. For this reason, a novel photonic packaging technology based on wafer-level assembly of the laser power converters by means of passive alignment will be disclosed in this paper. © 2014 SPIE.","ASIC; EMI/RFI-immunity; Energy-adaptivity; Laser power conversion; Power-over-fiber; Remote sensor","Actuators; Adaptive optics; Application specific integrated circuits; Cables; Convolutional codes; Data handling; Electric connectors; Electric power systems; Electromagnetic pulse; Energy efficiency; Light transmission; Optical communication; Remote sensing; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication cables; Adaptivity; EMI/RFI-immunity; Laser power; Power over fiber; Remote sensors; Security of data","","","","","","","undefined; Catanzaro, Brian E., Multigigabit optical transceivers for high data rate military applications, IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings, (2012); Carson, Richard F., Modular photonic power and VCSEL-based data links for aerospace and military applications, IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings, 3, pp. 197-210, (1997); Photonic Powered Cable Assembly; Werthen, Jan Gustav, Powering next generation networks by laser light over fiberl, OFC/NFOEC 2008 - 2008 Conference on Optical Fiber Communication/National Fiber Optic Engineers Conference, (2008); Krut, Dimitri D., A 53% high efficiency GaAs vertically integrated multi-junction laser power converter, 65th DRC Device Research Conference, pp. 123-124, (2007); Schubert, Johannes, High-voltage GaAs photovoltaic laser power converters, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, 56, 2, pp. 170-175, (2009); Sohr, Sebastian, Assembly tolerant design of multi-cell laser power converters for wafer-level photonic packaging, Proceedings - Electronic Components and Technology Conference, pp. 1866-1873, (2013); Application Report, (2014)","","Lewis, K.L.; Gruneisen, M.T.; Rarity, J.G.; Hollins, R.C.; Dusek, M.; Merlet, T.J.; Toet, A.","SPIE spie@spie.org","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Emerging Technologies in Security and Defence II; and Quantum-Physics-Based Information Security III","2014-09-22 through 2014-09-23","Amsterdam","110655","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922726204"

Our approach pillared on the geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) focusing on multiscale, internally-displaced persons' (IDP) camp information extraction from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) images. We applied twelve pansharpening algorithms to two subsets of a GeoEye-1 image scene that was taken over a former war-induced ephemeral settlement in Sri Lanka. A multidimensional assessment was employed to benchmark pansharpening algorithms with respect to their spectral and spatial fidelity. The multiresolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm of the eCognition Developer software served as the key algorithm in the segmentation process. The first study site was used for comparing segmentation results produced from the twelve fused products at a series of scale, shape, and compactness settings of the MRS algorithm. The segmentation quality and optimum parameter settings of the MRS algorithm were estimated by using empirical discrepancy measures. Non-parametric statistical tests were used to compare the quality of image object candidates, which were derived from the twelve pansharpened products. A wall-to-wall classification was performed based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify image objects candidates of the fused images. The second site simulated a more realistic crisis information extraction scenario where the domain expertise is crucial in segmentation and classification. We compared segmentation and classification results of the original images (non-fused) and twelve fused images to understand the efficacy of data fusion. We have shown that the GEOBIA has the ability to create meaningful image objects during the segmentation process by compensating the fused image's spectral distortions with the high-frequency information content that has been injected during fusion. Our findings further questioned the necessity of the data fusion step in rapid mapping context. Bypassing time-intensive data fusion helps to actuate EO-based rapid mapping workflows. We, however, emphasize the fact that data fusion is not limited to VHSR image data but expands over many different combinations of multi-date, multi-sensor EO-data. Thus, further research is needed to understand the synergies of data fusion and image segmentation with respect to multi-date, multi-sensor fusion scenarios and extrapolate our findings to other remote sensing application domains beyond EO-based crisis information retrieval. © 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Combinations of local, distributed and centralized processing are proposed. In this way one can match processing functionality to the required power, and available communication systems data rates, to obtain the desired reaction times. In the study, three priority scenarios were defined. For these scenarios, present-day and future sensors and signal processing technologies were studied. The priority scenarios were camp protection, patrol and house search. A method for analyzing information quality in single and multi-sensor systems has been applied. A method for estimating reaction times for transmission of data through the chain of command has been proposed and used. These methods are documented and can be used to modify scenarios, or be applied to other scenarios. Present day data processing is organized mainly locally. Very limited exchange of information with other platforms is present; this is performed mainly at a high information level. Main issues that arose from the analysis of present-day systems and methodology are the slow reaction time due to the limited field of view of present-day sensors and the lack of robust automated processing. Efficient handover schemes between wide and narrow field of view sensors may however reduce the delay times. The main effort in the study was in forecasting the signal processing of EO-sensors in the next ten to twenty years. Distributed processing is proposed between hand-held and vehicle based sensors. This can be accompanied by cloud processing on board several vehicles. Additionally, to perform sensor fusion on sensor data originating from different platforms, and making full use of UAV imagery, a combination of distributed and centralized processing is essential. There is a central role for sensor fusion of heterogeneous sensors in future processing. The changes that occur in the urban operations of the future due to the application of these new technologies will be the improved quality of information, with shorter reaction time, and with lower operator load. © 2013 SPIE.","Detection; EO-sensors; Identification; Signal processing forecast; Urban operations","Centralized processing; Electrooptical sensors; EO-sensors; European Defence Agency; Exchange of information; Quality of information; Signal processing technologies; Urban operations; Data processing; Electrooptical devices; Error detection; Identification (control systems); Military applications; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Spectroscopy; Sensor data fusion","","","","","","","Report to the European Defence Agency Eda Contract no 11 R T Op 99, (2013); Definition of Nominal Static Range Performance for Thermal Imaging Systems, (1989); Deaver, Dawne M., Modeling defined field of regard (FOR) search and detection in urban environments, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6207, (2006); Neider, Mark B., Cutting through the clutter: Searching for targets in evolving complex scenes, Journal of Vision, 11, 14, pp. 1-16, (2011); Bijl, Piet, Triangle orientation discrimination: The alternative to minimum resolvable temperature difference and minimum resolvable contrast, Optical Engineering, 37, 7, pp. 1976-1983, (1998); Bijl, Piet, Effectiveness assessment of signal processing in the presence of smear, Optical Engineering, 51, 6, (2012); Harney, Roberrt C., Information-based approach to performance estimation and requirements allocation in multisensor fusion for target recognition, Optical Engineering, 36, 3, pp. 789-798, (1997); Willet, Rebecca M., Compressed sensing for practical optical imaging systems: A tutorial, Optical Engineering, 50, 7, (2011); Dijk, Judith, Image enhancement on the INVIS integrated night vision surveillance and observation system, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 7689, (2010); undefined","","","","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Electro-Optical Remote Sensing, Photonic Technologies, and Applications VII; and Military Applications in Hyperspectral Imaging and High Spatial Resolution Sensing","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84890075933"

In particular, high spatial and high spectral resolution imaging provides promising data for many tasks such as classification and detecting objects of military relevance, such as camou flaged units or improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Especially in asymmetric warfare with highly mobile forces, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) needs to be available close to real-time. This demands the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in combination with downlink capability. The system described in this contribution is integrated in a wing pod for ease of installation and calibration. It is designed for the real-time acquisition and analysis of hyperspectral data. The main component is a Specim AISA Eagle II hyperspectral sensor, covering the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral range with a spectral resolution up to 1.2 nm and 1024 pixel across track, leading to a ground sampling distance below 1 m at typical altitudes. The push broom characteristic of the hyperspectral sensor demands an inertial navigation system (INS) for rectification and georeferencing of the image data. Additional sensors are a high resolution RGB (HR-RGB) frame camera and a thermal imaging camera. For on-line application, the data is preselected, compressed and transmitted to the ground control station (GCS) by an existing system in a second wing pod.

It works day and night, in good weather or bad. Bistatic SAR is a new kind of SAR system, where the transmitter and receiver are placed on two separate platforms. Bistatic SAR is one of the most important trends in SAR development, as the technology renders SAR more flexible and safer when used in military environments. Imaging is one of the most difficult and important aspects of bistatic SAR data processing. Although traditional SAR signal processing is fully developed, bistatic SAR has a more complex system structure, so signal processing is more challenging. Focusing on imaging aspects of bistatic SAR signal processing, this book covers resolution analysis, echo generation methods, imaging algorithms, imaging parameter estimation, and motion compensation methods. The book is ideal for researchers and engineers in SAR signal and data processing, as well as those working in bistatic and multistatic radar imaging, and in the radar sciences. Graduate students with a background in radar who are interested in bistatic and multistatic radar will find this book a helpful reference. Gives a general and updated framework for image formation using signal processing aspects. Starts with an introduction to traditional SAR before moving on to more advanced topics Offers readers a range of exhaustive tools to process signals and form images Provides a solid reference for the imaging of other complicated SAR Sample image synthesis exercises are available from the book's companion site.

Over the past few decades sensing devices have become more sophisticated with not only higher spatial resolution but have also now become more capable at capturing data in much more precisely defined bandwidths or frequency ranges. This provides the ability to identify particular vegetation, forestry, wildlife and fish, minerals - even camouflage - with greater precision. sky is processed. This chapter explains the transition that is rapidly occurring in terms of the transition from multispectral imaging to the much more precise and data intensive hyperspectral sensing - also called imaging spectroscopy. Much more capable electro-optical arrays (usually using charge coupled devices (CCDs) allow the capturing of hyperspectral data much more efficiently. In the past with multispectral sensing data was collected in perhaps five or perhaps as many as ten broad frequency bands. Now data can be collected in much more precise and narrower frequency bands in the infrared, near infrared, visible spectrum, and even ultraviolet bands. This chapter discusses the transition from multispectral to hyperspectral sensing that is now in full swing. It notes that the first uses of hyperspectral sensing were for military and defense-related purposes but now hyperspectral sensing - using the latest electro-optical arrays - is becoming central to civil earth observation programs. This transition has not only meant a change in the imaging process and the types of sensor devices included on remote sensing satellites, but it has also signaled the shift in data processing formats with data being processed as ""data cubes."" In this format spatial data is provided along the (X,Y axis) while the various frequency bands are displayed on the vertical or Z axis. This evolution of sensor capabilities has, however, led to new needs on the ground in terms of interpreting the data. The new interpretative needs - because much more data is captured - involve requirements for new and faster processing techniques on the ground. Or it has led to the need for ""preprocessing of data"" (i.e., discarding noncritical or nonmeaningful data) before being down loaded from the satellite. The point is that the more capable sensors that collect a larger amount of data serves to alter the way the torrent of data downloaded from the sky is processed.

Compared to traditional multispectral data, it offers a continuous coverage of electromagnetic spectra within their spectral range, where the so-called ""spectral signatures"" of the surface are acquired rather than discrete values within broad spectral bands. This allows a development of new methods for Earth surface object detection including a high accuracy target detection and/or quantitative retrieval of surface properties. The application of hyperspectral remote sensing data in the scientific and even the commercial community for creation of maps is quite broad - from agriculture (yield prediction and precise farming), forestry (forest health status, biomass estimation, species composition mapping) through geology (e.g. mapping of minerals, land degradation assessment), up to limnology (e.g. water quality evaluation), and other domain (e.g. military). Numbers of hyperspectral data providers are now present for surveys in Europe. However, each is using specific processing chain and harmonized quality indicators and quality layers accompanying hyperspectral data are often missing. That was the rationale for formation of the Joint Research Activity JRA2 ""HYQUAPRO"" within the FP7 EUFAR project (http://www.eufar.net). JRA2 was focused on developing of standardized quality layers for hyperspectral data. Partners of HYQUAPRO are among others PML/NERC, INTA, DLR, VITO/RSL, CVGZ - GzechGlobe, TAU, FUB, so all major processing facilities for airborne hyperspectral image data in Europe are included. Finally 13 quality layers were agreed to be a common base, which each hyperspectral data provider should incorporate into the processing chain. According to differences among sensors and data processing approaches, each data provider may include additional quality layers, specific to their pre-processing chain. Since 2004, the Global Change Research Centre - CzechGlobe (CVGZ, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic) has been operating the VNIR airborne hyperspectral sensor AISA Eagle. The AISA Eagle system is being produced by Spectral Imaging (Specim Ltd, Finland) company. A typical pre-processing of airborne hyperspectral data will be demonstrated in pre-processing chain which has been established at CzechGlobe including quality layers developed for the CzechGlobe pre-processing chain. © SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.","Airborne imaging spectroscopy; Hyperspectral data processing; Quality layers","Data processing; Exhibitions; Forestry; Object recognition; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Water quality; Airborne hyperspectral data; Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing; Airborne imaging; Hyperspectral Data; Hyperspectral image datas; Hyperspectral remote sensing data; Quality layers; Water quality evaluation; Chains; Air Craft; Data Processing; Image Analysis; Pattern Recognition; Water Quality","","","","","","","Goetz, Alexander F.H., Three decades of hyperspectral remote sensing of the Earth: A personal view, Remote Sensing of Environment, 113, SUPPL. 1, pp. S5-S16, (2009); Atmospheric Topographic Correction for Satellite Imagery, (2005); Parametric Geocoding, (2006); undefined","","","International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference sgem@sgem.org","","13th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2013","","","","13142704","9786197603200; 9786197603323; 9786197105810; 9786197105049; 9786197105582; 978-619-7105-01-8; 9786197408423; 9786197603743; 9786197105186; 9786197408270","","","English","Int.

In particular, target detection surveillance, which is an important military application of hyperspectral remote sensing, demands real-time or near real-time processing. The massive amount of hyperspectral image data seriously limits the processing speed. In this article, a strategy named spatial-spectral information extraction (SSIE) is presented to accelerate hyperspectral image processing. SSIE is composed of band selection and sample covariance matrix estimation. Band selection fully utilizes the high-spectral correlation in spectral image, while sample covariance matrix estimation fully utilizes the high-spatial correlation in remote sensing image. To overcome the inconsistent and irreproducible shortage of random distribution, we present an effective scalar method to select sample pixels. Meanwhile, we have implemented this target detection algorithm based on the SSIE strategy on the hardware of a digital signal processor (DSP). The implementation of a constrained energy minimization algorithm is composed of hardware and software architectures. The hardware architecture contains chips and peripheral interfaces, while software architecture contains a data transferring model. In the experiments, we compared the performance of hardware of DSP with that of Environment for Visualizing Images software. DSP speed up the data processing and also results in more effective in terms of recognition rate, which demonstrate that the SSIE implemented by DSP is sufficient to enable near real-time supervised target detection. © 2012 Zhang et al.; licensee Springer.","CEM; DSP; Hyperspectral image; Real-time processing; SSIE; Target detection","CEM; DSP; Hyper-spectral images; Realtime processing; SSIE; Covariance matrix; Data processing; Hardware; Image reconstruction; Independent component analysis; Information retrieval; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Software architecture; Spectroscopy; Target tracking","","","","","(2011AA120203); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (40901225); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2009CB723902); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work has been supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973) under Grant 2009CB723902, by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863) under Grant 2011AA120203, and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (40901225).

Effective response during the first hours is crucial but often hindered by a lack of current situational awareness information, combined with impaired accessibility of the affected location on the ground. Space technology can empower response forces and their commanders with better, quicker assessment for optimised use of their available resources. Satellite imagery is already being made available through various initiatives. In the European Space Agency's Integrated Applications Promotion (1AP) programme, the project SASISA (Small-Aircraft Service for Instant Situational Awareness) investigates and validates a significant additional new element that draws on three space technologies (satellite communication, remote sensing and navigation) in combination with terrestrial (airborne) technologies. This new approach moves significantly beyond what users can currently do. While aerial reconnaissance in disasters is already widely practised, it is not yet pursued as an integrated activity. Communication between the situation centre and the aircraft, if it exists, is limited to voice. Sensor data are usually only processed offline after the mission and so-called 'rapid mapping' products may take days to arrive. Furthermore, live video downlinks depend on the prior establishment of functioning line-of-sight radio links in the (devastated) zone of operations. Direct digital sensor data transmission from aircraft via satellite is rarely used in the civil sector. Finally, the high operational cost of near-broadband data streaming via satellite in the existing L-band network has put this approach beyond the reach of most public security agencies. SASISA shows that the availability of compact Ku-band (and soon Ka-band) terminals which can now be integrated in small affordable multipurpose aircraft such as the DA-42MPP reduces operational costs significantly and permits models of service provision that are feasible and attractive for public-sector users and, at the same time, constitute a viable business for aircraft operators and service integrators. This ability to directly provide frequent high-resolution still images and/or streaming video via IP over satellite to operations command centres at any distance beyond the line of sight opens up new opportunities for integrated geo-information processing in near-real time with interfaces to the users' own GIS infrastructure as well as their situational awareness, visualisation and mission command systems. SASISA aims at demonstrating the utility of such an integrated, modular and adaptive service to public-sector users across Europe.

In situ measurements are frequently not available in remote locations for many of the mountain gap locations globally, so to provide a record of these events for researchers, as well as military and commercial interests, this NASA-funded project is demonstrating how remotely sensed satellite data derived products, and fused model and observations, for wind and sea surface temperatures can be used to detect both wind jet and upwelling events. An algorithm was developed to automatically detect gap wind and ocean upwelling events at gulf regions of Central America using the Cross-Calibrated, Multi-Platform (CCMP) ocean surface wind product and the Optimally Interpolated Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) product. Hierarchical thresholding and region growing methods are used to extract regions of strong winds and temperature anomalies. A post processing step further links the detected events to generate time series of these events. Though developed for Central America regions, the algorithm is being extended to apply to other coastal regions so that detected event products are globally consistent. Through collaboration with the Global Hydrology Resource Center (GHRC), a NASA Distribute Active Archive Center, this project is analyzing large climate data records to generate a resulting climatology of wind jet and upwelling events at known geographic locations will be available as a resource for other researchers. Likewise, through integration of the project's analysis techniques with the GHRC's data ingest processing, the identification and notification of new or current events will likewise be openly available to research, commercial and military users. This paper provides a report on the preliminary results of applying the team's approach of identifying and capturing events for selected mountain gap jet locations. © 2012 IEEE.","climatology; remote sensing; upwelling; wind jets","Analysis techniques; Climate data records; In-situ measurement; Model and observation; Ocean surface winds; Region growing methods; Sea surface temperature (SST); upwelling; Algorithms; Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Data integration; Digital storage; Landforms; NASA; Offshore oil wells; Remote sensing; Research; Data processing","","","","","","","Atlas, Robert M., A cross-calibrated, multiplatform ocean surface wind velocity product for meteorological and oceanographic applications, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 92, 2, pp. 157-174, (2011); Brennan, Michael J., Observations of Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind events from quikSCAT: An updated event climatology and operational model evaluation, Weather and Forecasting, 25, 2, pp. 646-658, (2010); Bourassa, Mark A., Wind observations from new satellite and research vessels agree, Eos, 78, 51, pp. 597-602, (1997); Chelton, Dudley B., Satellite observations of the wind jets off the pacific coast of Central America.

In this paper we study how power, volume and geometry constraints of a CubeSat satellite cripple CubeSat communications and introduce CubeSat Torrent, a Torrent like distributed communication system, for CubeSat clusters. CubeSat Torrent aims to increase the downlink and uplink speeds of large files by distributing pieces of the files to CubeSats in the cluster and downloading different pieces of the files simultaneously from different CubeSats. The proposed system proved, through simulation experiments, to substantially improve the download and upload times of large files by a factor of about the size of cluster. Future work will include Distributed File System and Distributed Processing Framework for CubeSat clusters to store large amounts of data and do large scale data processing. © 2012 IEEE.","CubeSat Communications; Distributed communication; Satellite Communication Protocols; Torrent","Cubesat; Distributed communication systems; Distributed communications; Distributed file systems; Distributed processing frameworks; Geometry constraints; Large amounts of data; Large files; Large-scale data processing; Low data rates; Satellite clusters; Satellite communications; Torrent; Communication systems; Data processing; Distributed computer systems; Military communications; Remote sensing; Satellite communication systems; Space research; Satellites","","","","","","","A Survey of Cubesat Communication Systems, (2008); Muri, Paul, Enhancing small satellite communication through effective antenna system design, Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM, pp. 347-352, (2010); Ax 25 Version 2 2; Cubesat Space Protocol; Proceedings 3rd International Symposium on Formation Flying Missions and Technologies, (2008); Schilling, Klaus J., Earth observation by distributed networks of small satellites, International Conference on Instrumentation, Communication, Information Technology, and Biomedical Engineering 2009, ICICI-BME 2009, (2009); Relnav Relative Navigation Timing Data Communications for Cubesat Clusters; Scrofano, Ronald, Space-based local area network, Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM, (2009)","O.N.

As location-based services and personal navigation become more accessible to the public, automated and efficiently generated 3D models are required more urgently than ever. Considering the importance of 3D building models, they still lack economic and reliable techniques for their generation while taking advantage of the available multi-sensory data from single and multiple platforms. The research conducted on 3D building model generation may fall into the following three categories: data sources used (single or multi-source approaches), the processing strategy (data-driven or model-driven), and the amount of user interaction (semiautomatic or fully automatic). The objectives of this research is to propose fully-automatic building generation approach by integrating data-driven and model-driven methods while making use of multiple images and LiDAR datasets. The focus of reconstruction is on complex structures, which comprise a collection of rectangular primitives. The proposed methodology generates building hypotheses and initial-boundaries from LiDAR data (i.e., data-driven method) and this information is used to restrict the search space and to resolve the matching ambiguities in the images' space (i.e., model-based image fitting). To reduce the number of involved models, rectangular primitives are used and model parameters, height and slopes are determined from LiDAR data. An automatic algorithm for decomposing the initial LiDAR boundaries into several rectangular primitives is introduced.","Digital building model; LiDAR; Photogrammetry; Reconstruction","3D models; Automatic algorithms; Building model; Complex structure; Data sets; Data-driven methods; Data-sources; Disaster management; Hybrid approach; Image fitting; LIDAR data; Military simulation; Model parameters; Model-driven; Model-driven method; Multiple image; Multiple platforms; Multisources; Personal navigation; Search spaces; User interaction; Buildings; Data processing; Digital storage; Disaster prevention; Image matching; Image reconstruction; Location based services; Military applications; Optical radar; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Space optics; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","","","Awrangjeb, Mohammad, Automatic detection of residential buildings using LIDAR data and multispectral imagery, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 65, 5, pp. 457-467, (2010); Chaudhuri, Debasis, A simple method for fitting of bounding rectangle to closed regions, Pattern Recognition, 40, 7, pp. 1981-1989, (2007); International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, (2008); International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, (2009); Faig, Wolfgang, Automatic building extraction from aerial images, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 33, pp. 1708-1715, (2000); Freeman, Herbert, Determining the Minimum-Area Encasing Rectangle for an Arbitrary Closed Curve, Communications of the ACM, 18, 7, pp. 409-413, (1975); Habib, Ayman Fawzy, Calibration and stability analysis of medium-format digital cameras, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6312, (2006); Xxist ISPRS Proceedings 3 11 Jul 2008 Beijing China, (2008); Habib, Ayman Fawzy, Alternative methodologies for LiDAR system calibration, Remote Sensing, 2, 3, pp. 874-907, (2010); Habib, Ayman Fawzy, Generation of complex polyhedral building models by integrating stereo-aerial imagery and lidar data, Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 76, 5, pp. 609-623, (2010)","E.

They are sounder working at VHF/UHF band and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) that are able to provide high resolution images at P and L band. Behind these developments lie technological advances in antenna design, low noise amplifiers, band pass filters, digital receiver technology as well as new processing algorithms. The combination of low frequency and high bandwidth, creates a variety of military an civilian applications, ranging from the detection of targets concealed by foliage and/or camouflage or buried to forestry applications, biomass measuring, Archeological and geological exploration. Following these potentialities, the Italian Space Agency promoted the development of a new multi-mode and multi-band airborne radar system, that can be considered also a ""proof-of-concept"" for future dedicated spaceborne missions. The research consortium CO.RI.S.T.A. is in charge of the design, development and flight validation of such system, that is the first airborne radar entirely built in Italy.The radar is able to work either as nadir-looking sounder at VHF band (163 Mhz) and as side booking imager (SAR) at P band with two channels at 450 MHz and 900 MHz. The system uses a very flexible architecture due to the implementation of a direct digital synthesis(DDS) of transmitted signal and of stepped-frequency technology that allows the transmission of large bandwidth and facilitates multiple polarizations. Radar is controlled and timed by a powerful control unit based on FPGA technology that is also able to store all data with high data rate directly on SATA disks. Some flight campaigns have been performed on south Italy by using a helicopter of Aeronautica Militare.

Instrument and on-ground data processor performances and evolutions are analyzed and commented; finally, future developments are emphasized. ERS-2 was launched in 1995 by the European Space Agency (ESA). Since then, the active microwave instrument, which is one of the ERS-2 payloads, is providing radar backscattering coefficient measurements by using its three nominal operational acquisition mode: synthetic aperture mode (SAR mode), scatterometer mode (wind mode), and a special combination of the two over ocean where SAR and scatterometer mode are interleaved (wind/wave mode). The main applications for data acquired in scatterometer mode are related to the estimation of the wind vector over the sea surface. In that field, the ERS-2 scatterometer measurements give a very valuable contribution to the accuracy of the numerical weather forecast models, being assimilated in several meteorological weather forecast centers since the beginning of the mission. Other applications of the ERS-2 scatterometer data are over land to retrieve information about the soil water content and over the sea-ice. A constant monitoring of the scatterometer performances is carried out since the beginning of the mission by ESA engineering teams located in ESTEC and ESRIN and the instrument manufacture (Dornier at launch time), in collaboration with several European research institutions, as the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts for product geophysical validation, the Belgian Royal Military Academy for data processing and calibration during the zero-gyro phase, and industrial partners, as Serco SpA for the routine data quality control activities since the beginning of operational phase. Results show outstanding performances even after the failure of several hardware components that has been properly compensated on-ground with evolution of the processor, and many years of operation, which permits the creation of a homogeneous database of wind vectors for the last 16 years (20 years if the ERS-1 mission is considered), in accordance with Global Climate Observing System recommendations. © 2012 IEEE.","C-band; Calibration; European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS); scatterometry; wind vector","Acquisition modes; Active microwave instruments; C-band; Data processing algorithms; Data processors; Data quality control; Engineering teams; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; European research; European Space Agency; Global climate observing systems; Hardware components; Industrial partners; Mission performance; Numerical weather forecasts; Operational phase; Other applications; Radar backscattering coefficient; Remote sensing satellites; Satellite configuration; Scatterometer data; Scatterometer measurements; Scatterometers; Scatterometry; Sea surfaces; Soil water content; Weather forecasts; Wind vectors; Calibration; Data processing; Meteorological instruments; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar; Weather forecasting; Wind effects; Geodetic satellites; algorithm; backscatter; data processing; database; ERS-2; marine atmosphere; numerical model; performance assessment; satellite mission; scatterometer; sea ice; sea surface; synthetic aperture radar; weather forecasting; wind field","","","","","","","Francis, C.

A modern professional digital oblique camera such as MIDAS (Multi-camera Integrated Digital Acquisition System) is used to generate lifelike three dimensional to the users for visualizations, GIS applications, architectural modeling, city modeling, games, simulators, etc. Oblique imagery provide the best vantage for accessing and reviewing changes to the local government tax base, property valuation assessment, buying & selling of residential/commercial for better decisions in a more timely manner. Oblique imagery is also used for infrastructure monitoring making sure safe operations of transportation, utilities, and facilities. Sanborn Mapping Company acquired one MIDAS from TrackAir in 2011. This system consists of four tilted (45 degrees) cameras and one vertical camera connected to a dedicated data acquisition computer system. The 5 digital cameras are based on the Canon EOS 1DS Mark3 with Zeiss lenses. The CCD size is 5, 616 by 3, 744 (21 MPixels) with the pixel size of 6.4 microns. Multiple flights using different camera configurations (nadir/oblique (28mm/50mm) and (50mm/50mm)) were flown over downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado. Boresight fights for 28mm nadir camera were flown at 600m and 1, 200m and for 50mm nadir camera at 750m and 1500m. Cameras were calibrated by using a 3D cage and multiple convergent images utilizing Australis model. In this paper, the MIDAS system is described, a number of real data sets collected during the aforementioned flights are presented together with their associated flight configurations, data processing workflow, system calibration and quality control workflows are highlighted and the achievable accuracy is presented in some detail. This study revealed that the expected accuracy of about 1 to 1.5 GSD (Ground Sample Distance) for planimetry and about 2 to 2.5 GSD for vertical can be achieved. Remaining systematic errors were modeled by analyzing residuals using correction grid. The results of the final bundle adjustments are sufficient to enable Sanborn to produce DEM/DTM and orthophotos from the nadir imagery and create 3D models using georeferenced oblique imagery.","3D-city models; Accuracy; Bundle adjustment; Camera calibration; Digital airborne imaging systems; GPS/INS; Oblique images; Self-calibration","Calibration; Data acquisition; Data handling; Geographic information systems; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Systematic errors; Taxation; 3D city models; Accuracy; Bundle adjustments; Camera calibration; Digital airborne imaging systems; GPS/INS; Oblique images; Self calibration; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","","","Geometric and Radiometric Analysis of A Ccd Camera Based Photogrammetric Close Range System, (1992); Fraser, Clive S., Digital camera self-calibration, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 52, 4, pp. 149-159, (1997); Photogrammetrie Fernerkundung Geoinformation, (2008); Geometry of Vertical and Oblique Image Combinations, (2008); Accuracy Potential of Non Metric Cameras in Close Range Photogrammetry, (1985); International Calibration and Orientation Workshop, (2008); Madani, Mostafa, Increasing geometric accuracy of dmc's virtual images, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 37, pp. 19-25, (2008)","","El-Sheimy, N.; Shortis, M.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","ESRI; Hexagon; RMIT University, School of Mathematical and Geospatial Sciences","22nd Congress of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, ISPRS 2012","2012-08-25 through 2012-09-01","Melbourne","111120","16821750","9781629935126; 9781629934297; 9781629935201","","","English","Int.

The radar is intended to systematically survey and track all objects above an altitude dependant size threshold in the low Earth orbit and, based on these data, maintain a catalogue with physical and orbital information. Phased array radar demonstrators are currently being developed by industry in cooperation with ESA. These radars are precursor systems and will assist in the definition of the final SSA radar architecture. In support of these developments a small-scale phased array radar demonstrator is being developed at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC). The system is not intended to detect space debris objects but to implement the general functionality of its large-scale counterparts. This paper describes the mini-radar design and implementation. Furthermore, measurement results showing the performance of the system are presented. In order to cope with the high data processing throughput demand at the multi-channel receiver, an efficient field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation is adopted for the front-end pre-processing and digital beam-forming. As the computational burden for the forthcoming SSA phased array radar architecture including several hundreds or thousands of receiver elements is very high, an estimation of computational complexity for different signal processing building blocks is presented here. © 2012 IEEE.","digital beam-forming; FPGA; phased array radar; space situational awareness","Fog; Image analysis; Image fusion; Network security; Radar receivers; Remote sensing; Space debris; Space-based radar; Steganography; Tropics; Digital beam forming; Digital signals; European Space Agency; Field programmables; Field-programmable gate array; Front end; Phased array radars; Programmable gate array; Signal-processing; Space situational awareness; Surveillance radar","","","","","","","Declaration on the Space Situational Awareness Ssa Preparatory Programme, (2008); Proc European Space Surveillance Conference Essc 2011, (2011); Definition of Ground Segment Requirements for A Uhf Radar for the Essas, (2010); Proceedings of the European Workshop on Gnss Signals and Signal Processing, (2009); Seguin, Emmanuel, A dynamically-reconfigurable phased array radar processing system, Proceedings - 21st International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications, FPL 2011, pp. 258-263, (2011); Harter, Marlene, An FPGA controlled digital beamforming radar sensor with three-dimensional imaging capability, International Radar Symposium, IRS 2011 - Proceedings, pp. 441-446, (2011)","F.

In northern parts of Norway, the growing use of ATVs off-road has made considerable damage to the environment. In Troms County, the Norwegian Army has exercise and shooting ranges (battlefields) where there has been extensive use of light, medium and heavy armored military vehicles and ATVs for decades. The main objective of this study has been to test the feasibility of high spatial resolution satellite imagery as Ikonos and Quickbird in combination with fieldwork to detect tracks and damage caused by heavy armoured military vehicles (tanks) as well as medium and light ATVs. Applying simple image processing techniques, this study showed that larger parts of these areas were influenced and even small tracks and minor damage on the vegetation caused by small ATVs were easily detected. The total length of the tracks within the battlefields was calculated to be c. 1000km. Using a zone of damage/influence of 50m on each side of the tracks, the damaged and/or influenced area by ATVs was estimated to cover 56km 2 (17 per cent) of the total area of 334km 2. The conclusion of this study is that high-resolution optical satellite images are well suited for surveying damage on the vegetation caused by terrain vehicles in northern Norway. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Fens; Light ATVs; Military battlefields; Norway; Satellite remote sensing; Sub-Arctic; Tanks; Vulnerable environment","Fens; Military battlefields; Norway; Satellite remote sensing; Sub-arctic; Tanks; Vulnerable environment; All wheel drive vehicles; Damage detection; Image processing; Landforms; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Tanks (containers); Tanks (military); Vegetation; Vehicles; Satellite imagery; feasibility study; fieldwork; IKONOS; image resolution; QuickBird; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil erosion; spatial resolution; vegetation dynamics; vulnerability; Troms","","","","","","","undefined, (2004); Eastes, John W., Thermal signature characteristics of vehicle/terrain interaction disturbances: Implications for battlefield vehicle classification, Applied Spectroscopy, 58, 5, pp. 510-515, (2004); Forbes, Bruce C., High resilience in the Yamal-Nenets social-ecological system, West Siberian Arctic, Russia, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 106, 52, pp. 22041-22048, (2009); Vegetasjonstyper I Norge, (1997); Digital Image Processing, (2002); undefined, (2009); Kevan, Peter G., Vehicle tracks on high Arctic tundra: Their effects on the soil, vegetation, and soil arthropods, Journal of Applied Ecology, 32, 3, pp. 655-667, (1995); Lechner, Alex Mark, Remote sensing of small and linear features: Quantifying the effects of patch size and length, grid position and detectability on land cover mapping, Remote Sensing of Environment, 113, 10, pp. 2194-2204, (2009); Lipo, Carl P., Mapping prehistoric statue roads on Easter Island, Antiquity, 79, 303, pp. 158-168, (2005); undefined, (2005)","H.

One of the main challenges of deploying such unmanned systems for large-scale military operations is the lack of interoperability among different types of unmanned systems. This constraint introduces even greater problems as we move toward unmanned missions that require multiple platforms to work cooperatively, even in environments where human operators cannot readily provide any mission inputs. If we expect cooperative unmanned systems technologies to advance rapidly in the future, it is essential that we, the unmanned systems community, remove this interoperability constraint. To this end, we developed a scalable, onboard unmanned system called cooperative autonomous system (CAS) capable of mounting on multiple vehicle types to address key aspects of the interoperability problem. The CAS includes a comprehensive collection of hardware and software modules designed for real-time coordination of unmanned aircraft and autonomous ground vehicles. These modules are essential capabilities to perform cooperative missions: to navigate and control the platform, to communicate with other unmanned systems, to process information transmitted by neighboring unmanned systems, and to fuse data collected from other unmanned systems with its local sensor data. We created CAS interfaces for several commercially available autopilots, mobile robot platforms, and industry-standard sensor and communication devices. The CAS software is based on an open-source, multi-threaded, event-driven framework that combines cross-platform compatibility with object-oriented software that encapsulates a variety of asynchronous control, sensing, and communication mechanisms. The hardware of CAS is made of modular units to allow a plug-and-play ability, depending on a particular mission application. We successfully demonstrated the interoperability of CAS by implementing the system on two different unmanned aircraft and an unmanned mobile ground platform. We show results from an ISR experiment with three different mobile platforms and a set of stationary sensors. Sensors employed were electro-optical and infrared cameras as well as radio frequency receivers.","","Autonomous ground vehicles; Communication mechanisms; Military intelligence; Mobile robot platforms; Object oriented software; Radio frequency receivers; Remote sensing platforms; Unmanned ground vehicles; Aircraft; Communication; Data processing; Ground vehicles; Hardware; Interoperability; Military operations; Navigation; Sensors; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems","","","","","","","Grocholsky, Ben P., Cooperative air and ground surveillance, IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 13, 3, pp. 16-26, (2006); Mullens, Katherine D., Collaborative engagement experiment, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6230 I, (2006); Yoon, Youngrock, Autonomous target detection and localization using cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles, Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences, 381, pp. 195-205, (2009); Vidal, Reńe, Probabilistic pursuit-evasion games: Theory, implementation, and experimental evaluation, IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, 18, 5, pp. 662-669, (2002); Pack, Daniel J., Cooperative Control of UAVs for Localization of Intermittently Emitting Mobile Targets, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 39, 4, pp. 959-970, (2009); Hager, Chad E., Cooperative target localization using heterogeneous unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, IEEE/RSJ 2010 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS 2010 - Conference Proceedings, pp. 2952-2957, (2010); Plett, Gregory L., Out-of-order sigma-point Kalman filtering for target localization using cooperating unmanned aerial vehicles, Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences, 369, pp. 21-43, (2007)","","","","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)","AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conference and Exhibit 2011","","","","","9781600869440","","","English","AIAA Infotech at Aerospace Conf. and Exhib. 2011","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880803838"

Depending on the application, the needs and the constraints are different and imaging systems can offer a large variety of configurations in terms of wavelength, resolution, field-of-view, focal length or sensitivity. Adequate image processing algorithms allow the extraction of the needed information and the interpretation of images. As a prime contractor for many major civil or military projects, Astrium ST is very involved in the proposition, development and realization of new image-based techniques and systems for space-related purposes. Among the different applications, space surveillance is a major stake for the future of space transportation. Indeed, studies show that the number of debris in orbit is exponentially growing and the already existing population of small and medium debris is a concrete threat to operational satellites. This paper presents Astrium ST activities regarding space surveillance for space situational awareness (SSA) and space traffic management (STM). Among other possible SSA architectures, the relevance of a ground-based optical station network is investigated. The objective is to detect and track space debris and maintain an exhaustive and accurate catalogue up-to-date in order to assess collision risk for satellites and space vehicles. The system is composed of different type of optical stations dedicated to specific functions (survey, passive tracking, active tracking), distributed around the globe. To support these investigations, two in-house operational breadboards were implemented and are operated for survey and tracking purposes. This paper focuses on Astrium ST end-to-end optical-based survey concept. For the detection of new debris, a network of wide field of view survey stations is considered: those stations are able to detect small objects and associated image processing (detection and tracking) allow a preliminary restitution of their orbit. © 2011 SPIE.","Space situational awareness; Space surveillance; Survey; Wide-field telescope","Active tracking; Astrium; Collision risks; Core technology; Detection and tracking; Field of views; Focal lengths; Ground based; Image based system; Image processing algorithm; Image-based techniques; In-orbit; Mission requirements; Passive tracking; Prime contractors; Small objects; Space situational awareness; Space traffic management; Space transportations; Space vehicles; Station network; Wide field of view; Wide-field; Digital image storage; Image processing; Military photography; Monitoring; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Space optics; Space surveillance; Surveys; Tracking (position); Traffic control; Space debris","","","","","","","ESA Essc, (2011); Space Surveillance and Tracking Segment Customer Requirements Document, (2011); Vu, Paul N., Large area detectors and new sensor technologies at Fairchild Imaging, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6276, (2006); Boggs, Kasey, Large area devices at semiconductor technology associates, Inc., Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6068, (2006)","","","","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Electro-Optical Remote Sensing, Photonic Technologies, and Applications V","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-81155154262"

By incorporating the polarization of light as supplementary information to such electro-optic imaging systems, it is possible to increase their target discrimination capabilities, considering that man-made objects are known to depolarized light in different manner than natural backgrounds. As it is known that electro-magnetic radiation emitted and reflected from a smooth surface observed near a grazing angle becomes partially polarized in the visible and infrared wavelength bands, additional information about the shape, roughness, shading, and surface temperatures of difficult targets can be extracted by processing effectively such reflected/emitted polarized signatures. This paper presents a set of polarimetric image processing algorithms devised to extract meaningful information from a broad range of man-made objects. Passive polarimetric signatures are acquired in the visible, shortwave infrared, midwave infrared, and longwave infrared bands using a fully automated imaging system developed at DRDC Valcartier. A fusion algorithm is used to enable the discrimination of some objects lying in shadowed areas. Performance metrics, derived from the computed Stokes parameters, characterize the degree of polarization of man-made objects. Field experiments conducted during winter and summer time demonstrate: 1) the utility of the imaging system to collect polarized signatures of different objects in the visible and infrared spectral bands, and 2) the enhanced performance of target discrimination and fusion algorithms to exploit the polarized signatures of man-made objects against cluttered backgrounds. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","infrared bands; Polarimetric imaging; polarized light; target discrimination","Degree of polarization; Electro-optic imaging; Enhanced performance; Field experiment; Fusion algorithms; Grazing angles; Infrared bands; Infrared spectral bands; Infrared wavelengths; Long wave infrared; Man made objects; Midwave infrared; Natural backgrounds; Performance metrics; Polarimetric image; Polarimetric imaging; Polarized signatures; Search and rescue; Short wave infrared; Smooth surface; Stokes parameters; Supplementary information; Surface temperatures; Surveillance operations; target discrimination; Targets of interest; Algorithms; Digital image storage; Image processing; Imaging systems; Optical data processing; Polarization; Polarographic analysis; Remote sensing; Polarimeters","","","","","","","Lavigne, Daniel A., Enhanced military target discrimination using active and passive polarimetric imagery, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 5, 1, pp. V354-V357, (2008); Cremer, Frank, Infrared polarisation measurements of targets and backgrounds in a marine environment, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 4370, pp. 169-180, (2001); Lin, Shihschön, Separation and contrast enhancement of overlapping cast shadow components using polarization, Optics Express, 14, 16, pp. 7099-7108, (2006); Solomon, Jerry E., Polarization imaging, Applied Optics, 20, 9, pp. 1537-1544, (1981); Lavigne, Daniel A., A New passive polarimetric imaging system collecting polarization signatures in the visible and infrared bands, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 7300, (2009); Tyo, J.

Over the last few years, ALS has proved its capability of rapid acquisition of accurate topographic data. With the advantages of high accuracy, ALS data has become an accepted data source for highly automated acquisition of digital surface models (DSM) as well as for the generation of digital elevation models (DEM) which have been used in many applications such as civic planning, military navigation and natural hazard risk assessment. To utilize the 3D data provided by the ALS systems however, efficient methods for data processing and model construction needs to be developed. In this paper some recent technique on analysis and visualization modelling of ALS data will be presented. After the brief presentation of the ALS system, the computation of ALS data is introduced. The data processing chain for producing DSM is outlined. A data filtering method is proposed for generating DEM. A 3D visualization modelling study on ground scene is carried out and the framework of establishing visualization of DSM and DEM using ALS data is brought as well. © 2011 SPIE.","Airborne laser scanning; Digital elevation models; Morphological filter; Visualization modeling","3D data; 3D information; 3D Visualization; Airborne Laser scanning; Data filtering; Data processing chains; Data source; Digital elevation model; Digital surface models; Efficient method; Model construction; Modelling studies; Morphological filter; Natural hazard risk assessment; Rapid acquisition; Remote sensing techniques; Topographic data; Visualization modeling; Data handling; Data visualization; Digital instruments; Geomorphology; Laser applications; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Military applications; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Scanning; Surveying; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Three dimensional","","","","","","","Söderman, Ulf, Three-dimensional environment models from airborne laser radar data, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5412, pp. 333-344, (2004); Wehr, Aloysius, Airborne laser scanning - An introduction and overview, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 54, 2-3, pp. 68-82, (1999); Baltsavias, Emmanuel P., Airborne laser scanning: Basic relations and formulas, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 54, 2-3, pp. 199-214, (1999); Chen, Qi, Filtering airborne laser scanning data with morphological methods, Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 73, 2, pp. 175-185, (2007); Pfeifer, Norbert, Extraction of building footprints from airborne laser scanning: Comparison and validation techniques, 2007 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event, URS, (2007); Axelsson, Peter, Processing of laser scanner data - Algorithms and applications, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 54, 2-3, pp. 138-147, (1999); Lohmann, Peter, Approaches to the filtering of laser scanner data, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 33, pp. 540-547, (2000)","","","","Chinese Society of Astronautics","International Symposium on Photoelectronic Detection and Imaging 2011: Laser Sensing and Imaging; and Biological and Medical Applications of Photonics Sensing and Imaging","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052488390"

Modern response management systems capitalize on the capabilities of a plethora of sensors and its output for situational awareness. Firestorm utilizes a unique networked lethality approach by integrating unmanned air and ground vehicles to provide target handoff and sharing of data between humans and sensors. The system employs Bayesian networks for track management of sensor data, and distributed auction algorithms for allocating targets and delivering the right effect without information overload to the Warfighter. Firestorm Networked Effects Component provides joint weapon-target pairing, attack guidance, target selection standards, and other fires and effects components. Moreover, the open and modular architecture allows for easy integration with new data sources. Versatility and adaptability of the application enable it to devise and dispense a suitable response to a wide variety of scenarios. Recently, this application was used for detecting and countering a vehicle intruder with the help of radio frequency spotter sensor, command driven cameras, remote weapon system, portable vehicle arresting barrier, and an unmanned aerial vehicle - which confirmed the presence of the intruder, as well as provided lethal/non-lethal response and battle damage assessment. The completed demonstrations have proved Firestorm's™ validity and feasibility to predict, detect, neutralize, and protect key assets and/or area against a variety of possible threats. The sensors and responding assets can be deployed with numerous configurations to cover the various terrain and environmental conditions, and can be integrated to a number of platforms. © 2011 SPIE.","Attack guidance; Collaborative engagement; Modular architecture; Networked lethality; Target deconfliction; Target handoff; Track management; Weapon-target pairing","Attack guidance; Collaborative engagement; Modular architectures; Networked lethality; Track management; Weapon-target pairing; Bayesian networks; Damage detection; Data handling; Ground vehicles; Inference engines; Network architecture; Network management; Sensors; Unmanned vehicles; Information management","","","","","","","Dcdis Proceedings, (2005); Bogdanowicz, Zbigniew R., New algorithm for optimization of effect-based weapon-target pairings, Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Scientific Computing, CSC 2008, pp. 3-8, (2008); Interfaces, (1990); Linear Network Optimization Algorithms and Codes, (1991); Bogdanowicz, Zbigniew R., Efficient methodology and robust infrastructure for assigning weapons to targets, Proceedings of the International Conference on Modeling, Simulation and Visualization Methods, MSV'04 and Proceedings of the Int.

This technological great leap forward has paved the way to a new generation of GeoVisual Analytics (GVA) applications capable to ensure access, filtering and processing of large repositories of geospatial information. Within this context we refer to GeoVisual Analytics as the set of tools, technologies and methodologies which can be deployed to increase situational awareness by helping operators identify specific data patterns within a vast information flow made of multidimensional geographical data coming from static databases as well as from sensor networks. This shift, which essentially follows the vision of a ""Digital Earth"" envisaged by Al Gore a decade ago, is bringing concepts typical of Ambient Intelligence to a wider, environmental scale. The chapter first presents the reasons that have brought to such a radical shift and it highlights the profound implications at the technological and societal level. We further demonstrate how the domain of ambient intelligence is not any more spatially limited and how the combined use of AMI and VA can be essential for the development of new tools to be used at environmental scale level. The convergence of technologies typical of GVA with those of AmI can be crucial within several mission-critical tasks, typical for instance of environmental management and control. These can be significantly enhanced through the adoption of paradigms and technologies typical of Ambient Intelligence including sensor networks, pervasive computing, advanced visualization technologies, human-computer interaction, data processing, indexing, intelligent extraction and filtering of data. The following sections then showcase the results of an extensive research effort by the authors (De Amicis et al., 2009; De Amicis et al., 2009a; Conti et al. 2009) whereby functionalities typical of AmI have been integrated within a GeoVisual Analytics (GVA) framework. The research work foster a paradigm shift. The typical AmI paradigm sees users interact in a seamless manner objects and systems that surround them. Object and systems used in our daily lives exchange information to react or proactively support users in the most transparent way. However this requires both a controlled space and devices or objects being fitted specific technologies or sensors. The authors instead propose a paradigm shift whereby the user can related to a boundary-free space interacting with its virtual instance that represents it. The solution developed has been designed to support the decision making processes in the context of environmental management where it is essential to provide the means for tasks such as early warning system, risk assessment and mapping, risk management and last but not least, simulation. The system has been designed to allow operators to interactively access and create geographical information as well as to visually build, encapsulate, and parameterize complex geo-processing models within a 3D interactive environment. The chapter finally concludes by highlighting a number of open challenges brought by the convergence between GVA and AmI which need to be addressed by the research community in the next future. © 2011 by IGI Global.

It is thus is a powerful tool for Earth monitoring. Certain applications, such as disaster relief, military reconnaissance and ice-flow and ship monitoring require a continuous flow of high-resolution images covering large areas; however, given the large amount of complex data generated and system limitations of data bandwidth and processing speed, not all the requirements can be met at the same time. In addition, multiple user requests are often submitted to the SAR system platform, and not all can be addressed, again due to limitations of area coverage. Increasing the speed of SAR processors and processing on-board are two ways to improve the SAR data throughput and therefore to meet the operational needs of all users. This paper discusses an optronic SAR processor capable of rapidly processing full-scene multi-looked images. Details of the processor design and image results are discussed.

As in MOUT scenarios threats usually arise from humans one important task is the robust detection of humans. Detection of humans in MOUT by image processing systems can be very challenging, e.g., due to complex outdoor scenes where humans have a weak contrast against the background or are partially occluded. Porikli et al. introduced covariance descriptors and showed their usefulness for human detection in complex scenes. However, these descriptors do not lie on a vector space and so well-known machine learning techniques need to be adapted to train covariance descriptor classifiers. We present a novel approach based on manifold learning that simplifies the classification of covariance descriptors. In this paper, we apply this approach for detecting humans. We describe our human detection method and evaluate the detector on benchmark data sets generated from real-world image sequences captured during MOUT exercises. © 2010 SPIE.","Covariance descriptor; Human detection; Laplacian eigenmaps; Military operations in urban terrain; Region covariance; Supervised manifold learning","Covariance descriptor; Human detection; Laplacian eigenmaps; Manifold learning; Military operations in urban terrain; Region covariance; Data processing; Image processing; Landforms; Military operations; Vector spaces; Detectors","","","","","","","Lee, Dah Jye, Shape-based human detection for threat assessment, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5438, pp. 81-91, (2004); Heinze, Norbert, Image exploitation for misar, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 6568, (2007); Krüger, Wolfgang, Robust and efficient map-to-image registration with line segments, Machine Vision and Applications, 13, 1, pp. 38-50, (2001); ISPRS Intercommission Workshop, (1987); Alvey Vision Conference, (1988); Utsumi, Akira, Human detection using geometrical pixel value structures, Proceedings - 5th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face Gesture Recognition, FGR 2002, pp. 39-44, (2002); Dalal, Navneet, Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection, Proceedings - 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2005, I, pp. 886-893, (2005); Lowe, David G., Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints, International Journal of Computer Vision, 60, 2, pp. 91-110, (2004); Viola, Paul A., Detecting pedestrians using patterns of motion and appearance, International Journal of Computer Vision, 63, 2, pp. 153-161, (2005); Gavrila, Dariu M., Multi-cue pedestrian detection and tracking from a moving vehicle, International Journal of Computer Vision, 73, 1, pp. 41-59, (2007)","","","","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Visual Information Processing XIX","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79958062216"

The UGS network can be applied in a variety of areas including border surveillance, special force operations, perimeter and building protection, target acquisition, situational awareness, and force protection. In this paper, a highly-distributed, fault-tolerant, and energyefficient Smart Sensing Surveillance System (S4) is presented to efficiently provide 24/7 and all weather security operation in a situation management environment. The S4 is composed of a number of distributed nodes to collect, process, and disseminate heterogeneous sensor data. Nearly all S4 nodes have passive sensors to provide rapid omnidirectional detection. In addition, Pan- Tilt- Zoom- (PTZ) Electro-Optics EO/IR cameras are integrated to selected nodes to track the objects and capture associated imagery. These S4 camera-connected nodes will provide applicable advanced on-board digital image processing capabilities to detect and track the specific objects. The imaging detection operations include unattended object detection, human feature and behavior detection, and configurable alert triggers, etc. In the S4, all the nodes are connected with a robust, reconfigurable, LPI/LPD (Low Probability of Intercept/ Low Probability of Detect) wireless mesh network using Ultra-wide band (UWB) RF technology, which can provide an ad-hoc, secure mesh network and capability to relay network information, communicate and pass situational awareness and messages. The S4 utilizes a Service Oriented Architecture such that remote applications can interact with the S4 network and use the specific presentation methods. The S4 capabilities and technologies have great potential for both military and civilian applications, enabling highly effective security support tools for improving surveillance activities in densely crowded environments and near perimeters and borders. The S4 is compliant with Open Geospatial Consortium - Sensor Web Enablement (OGC-SWE®) standards. It would be directly applicable to solutions for emergency response personnel, law enforcement, and other homeland security missions, as well as in applications requiring the interoperation of sensor networks with handheld or body-worn interface devices. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","LPI/LPD (Low Probability of Intercept/ Low Probability of Detect); mesh network; OGC-SWE®; Pan- Tilt- Zoom- (PTZ) Electro-Optics/Infrared (EO/IR) cameras; situational awareness; Ultra-wide band (UWB); Unattended ground sensor (UGS) networks","Low probability; mesh network; Pan- Tilt- Zoom- (PTZ) Electro-Optics/Infrared (EO/IR) cameras; Situational awareness; Unattended ground sensors; Smart sensing; Behavioral research; Biological systems; Body sensor networks; Cameras; Digital signal processing; Electrooptical devices; Image processing; Information services; MESH networking; Military applications; Monitoring; Neural networks; Optical data processing; Probability; Security systems; Sensor networks; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Signal processing; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Artificial intelligence; Metadata; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Technology; Telecommunication equipment; User interfaces; Unattended sensors","","","","","","","Understanding Smart Sensors, (2000); Mason, Michael, Using histograms to detect and track objects in color video, Proceedings - Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop, 2001-January, pp. 154-159, (2001); Wscg International Conference on Computer Graphics Visualization and Computer Vision, (2002); Haritaoğlu, Ismail, W4: Who?

Concurrent changes in the magnitude and spatial variability of remote sensing reflectance (R<inf>rs</inf>) ratios and submerged scattering layers were investigated in coastal waters of the northern Gulf of Alaska during summer of 2002 based on high resolution and simultaneous passive (MicroSAS) and active (Fish Lidar Oceanic Experimental, FLOE) optical measurements. Principal Component Analysis revealed that the spatial variability of total lidar backscattering signal (S) between 2.1 and 20m depth was weakly associated with changes in the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of surface waters. Also based on a 250-m footprint, the vertical attenuation of S was inversely related to the IOPs (Spearman Rank Correlation up to -0.43). Low (arithmetic average and standard deviation) and high (skewness and kurtosis) moments of R<inf>rs</inf>(443)/R<inf>rs</inf>(490) and R<inf>rs</inf>(508)/R<inf>rs</inf>(555) ratios were correlated with vertical changes in total lidar backscattering signal (S) at different locations. This suggests the use of sub-pixel ocean color statistics to infer the spatial distribution of sub-surface scattering layers in coastal waters characterized by stratified conditions, well defined S layers (i.e., magnitude of S maximum comparable to near surface values), and relatively high vertically integrated phytoplankton pigments in the euphotic zone (chlorophyll a concentration >150mgm-2). © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Alaska; Backscattering; Coastal waters; Inherent optical properties; Lidar; Ocean color; Passive optical data; Statistical modes; Vertical structure","Alaska; Coastal waters; Inherent optical properties; Lidar; Ocean color; Optical data; Statistical modes; Vertical structures; Backscattering; Chlorophyll; Color; Marine applications; Military applications; Military operations; Oceanography; Optical data processing; Porphyrins; Principal component analysis; Remote sensing; Size distribution; Optical radar; backscatter; chlorophyll a; coastal water; data set; euphotic zone; lidar; ocean color; optical method; optical property; phytoplankton; pixel; principal component analysis; reflectance; remote sensing; spatial variation; stratification; vertical distribution; Gulf of Alaska; Pacific Ocean","","","","","U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, NRL, (PE0601153N)","This work was supported by the NRL internal project “3D Remote Sensing with a Multiple-Band Active and Passive System: Theoretical Basis”, PE0601153N .

Such gaps can occur due to launch delay, launch failure, inconsistencies, or data jumps in radiometric scales between satellites. The presence of such gaps limit the ability of using measurements to detect the small changes in key environmental variables that result from climate change. Leading experts in the Earth Observation community from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and academia attended the meeting to prioritize the calibration strategies for bridging and mitigating satellite data gaps for climate change detection. These strategies include establishing SI traceability for satellite sensor calibration and measurements; continuing improvements in prelaunch, onboard, and vicarious calibrations and transfer standards; establishing celestial standards and procedures for intercomparisons; establishing SI traceability for alternative measurement strategies, such as in-situ networks and airborne sensor campaigns; and leveraging international satellite assets.

Web-based Geospatial image map systems make satellite remote sensing data available to a wider range of public users than ever before. The storage and organization of global massive multi-dimensional remote sensing data have a big impact on the performance of Web mapping systems. To implement a performance-optimized Web mapping system, we propose a global grid division pyramid hierarchical data model for massive remote sensing data management, and adopt Hilbert curve allocation method for data placements. Collaborative web map browsing is also very important for many applications such as crisis management, military activities and government decision-making. However, realizing collaboration functionality on the basis of the stateless HTTP protocol, optimized for client requests, is not trivial. The limitations of the Web's request/response architecture prevent server from pushing real-time dynamic Web data. To address this problem, we propose a web-based interactive collaborative browsing framework based on server push technique (Comet). Moreover, we develop a prototype system called ACTGIS. Finally, we evaluate the prototype system using real remote sensing datasets, which demonstrate the good performance data access in our system. © 2010 IEEE.","Collaborative browsing; Comet; Hierarchical data model; Hilbert space-filling curve; Web map service","Collaborative browsing; Comet; Hierarchical data; Hilbert space-filling curve; Web map services; Curve fitting; Data processing; Decision making; Hilbert spaces; Hypertext systems; Military applications; Models; Optimization; Remote sensing; Space optics; Internet protocols","","","","","","","Indiana Computer Science Report Tr610, (2005); Yang, Chaowei Phil, Web map server performance and client design principles, GIScience and Remote Sensing, 44, 4, pp. 320-333, (2007); Cai, Guoray, Extending distributed GIS to support geo-collaborative crisis management, Geographic Information Sciences, 11, 1, pp. 4-14, (2005); Ogc Document, (2009); Barclay, Tom, Microsoft TerraServer: A spatial data warehouse, SIGMOD Record (ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data), 29, 2, pp. 307-318, (2000); Yang, Chaowei Phil, Performance-improving techniques in web-based GIS, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 19, 3, pp. 319-342, (2005); Proc of Www, (2002); Proceedings of the 2004 Iadis International Www Internet Conference, (2004); Hoyos-Rivera, Guillermo de Jesús, CoLab: A flexible collaborative Web browsing tool, Proceedings - International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, AINA, 1, pp. 501-506, (2005); Web Services Based Architecture, (2004)","C.

Once remote sensing and intelligent data processing technology are applied to supplement manual data recording, however, very few data visualization tools in construction exist that allow visualizing dynamic resource data in a field realistic virtual reality environment and are at the same time able to perform this task in or near real-time. Moreover, technology to assist in real-time data visualization and situational awareness can have a significant impact on stakeholders' successful and safe completion of construction projects. This research addresses the need for realtime data collection and visualization technology in construction applications. It reviews state-of-the-art technology in this field and presents a new framework that implements real-time remote sensing and data visualization technology in two significant construction applications: (1) Real-time pro-active construction safety assessment and training, and (2) Real-time construction productivity and performance monitoring. Preliminary results to each of these scenarios are presented and discussed.

Both aerial and ground vehicle platforms were employed, exposing a single sensor suite to a variety of conditions relevant to civil and military applications, including urban and rural terrain and varied time-of-day. The sensor package includes four visible cameras, two LWIR cameras, inertial measurement units ranging from navigation grade, tactical grade and industrial grade. A GINS is utilized to establish platform attitude and position truth. The raw GPS signals are also collected. All this data is synchronously time-stamped with reference to a unified reference time. Of particular interest to the research community is the use of visual sensors to navigate in GNSS-limited environments, especially in cases where the navigation solution must exhibit dynamic continuity. Our data delivery framework goes beyond standardizing data formats by providing a means to standardize the application of relevant processing algorithms. This plays a critical role in integrating data from multiple sensors without violating dynamic constraints. In addition, the framework can be viewed as a testbed for user contributed algorithms, which will help system integrators to explore the trade space of both sensors and algorithms.","","Data delivery; Data format; Data sets; Dynamic constraints; GPS signals; Help systems; Inertial measurement unit; Multi sensor; Multiple sensors; Navigation data; Navigation solution; Object-oriented frameworks; Optical navigation; Processing algorithms; Reference time; Research communities; Sensor packages; Single sensor; Trade space; Visual sensor; Algorithms; Cameras; Data processing; Industrial research; Military applications; Military vehicles; Navigation; Sensors; Statistical tests; Test facilities; Units of measurement; Global positioning system","","","","","","","Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab; Project Functionalnavigation on Google Code, (2010); Kim, Jun-sik, Motion estimation using multiple non-overlapping cameras for small unmanned aerial vehicles, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 3076-3081, (2008); Kumar, Ram Krishan, Simple calibration of non-overlapping cameras with a mirror, 26th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR, (2008); Vision Interface, (1995); Lowe, David G., Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints, International Journal of Computer Vision, 60, 2, pp. 91-110, (2004); Lucas, Bruce D., ITERATIVE IMAGE REGISTRATION TECHNIQUE WITH AN APPLICATION TO STEREO VISION., 2, pp. 674-679, (1981); Olson, Edwin B., Fast iterative alignment of pose graphs with poor initial estimates, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006, pp. 2262-2269, (2006)","J.

This optical imaging project is conducted by the French National Space Agency, CNES. It will operate two satellites designed to provide optical images to civilian and military users. The first satellite is ready for launch, the second 18 months later. It will allow, in Nadir acquisition conditions, to deliver image products 20 km wide, false or natural coloured scenes with a 50 cm ground sampling distance. Imaging capabilities have been highly optimized in order to acquire, in the same pass, along-track mosaics, stereo pairs and triplets, and multi-targets. To fulfil the operational requirements and ensure quick access to information, ground processing has to automatically perform the radiometric and geometric corrections. Since ground processing capabilities have been taken into account very early in the mission development, it has been possible to relax some costly on-board components requirements, in order to achieve a cost effective on-board/ground compromise.

Besi Camp, Selangor, Malaysia. It was reported found crashed with all six air force crew onboard killed, four days later on 17 July 2007 at 13.25 hours 5 km North-west of Genting-Sempah-Karak-Highway. Design/methodology/approach - The objective is achieved by exploring the use of a very high 1 m2 spatial resolution (pixel-based) airborne hyperspectral imaging system near real-time data processing within two hours after landing. The UPM-Aeroscan's AISA is a state-of-the-art aircraft mounted commercial hyperspectral sensor operated for SAR development application by Forest Geospatial Information and Survey Lab (FGISL)/Aeroscan Precision (M) Sdn Bhd. in Block C3, UPM-MTDC Tech Centre, Lebuh Silikon, Universiti Putra Malaysia. It is designed to provide a near real time, frequent, repetitive, accurate and reliable pushbroom instrument that acquires images in hundreds of registered, contiguous narrow spectral band passes such that for each element it is possible to derive a complete reflectance spectrum between the tree crowns, a damaged or slashed tree canopy and an anomaly especially metal like foreign object that penetrates into the tree crowns of a dense forest. Using an advanced Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) digital analysis and two archives spectral signatures of flying and ""parked"" NURI helicopters, in addition to ground supporting data from the civilian eye-witnesses, spectral matching of images is applied to identify and map the missing helicopter. Findings - Despite the bad weather hampering the search and air surveillance-to-ground verifications, the NURI helicopter was reported found crashed with all six air force crew onboard killed, four days later based on the GPS suspected locations analysed and mapped from the UPM-APSB's AISA airborne hyperspectral sensor data. The GPS locations given by the image were, however, not accurate for ground verifications since an old military topographical map were used. The GPS locations from the airborne image was transferred on to a Google Earth image in the Operations Room but, for ground verifications, a different set of reference topographical maps were used. However, the suspected search target sites were not that far away from the actual sighted RMAF NURI helicopter wreckage. Originality/value - The value and contribution of this research are the successful application of operating a pixel-based airborne hyperspectral sensor to locate missing military helicopters in SAR. It is expected that the UPM-APSB's AISA airborne hyperspectral sensor can be of further use in future SAR for missing civilian helicopters or commercial aircraft. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Forests; Helicopters; Search and rescue; Sensors","","","","","","","","undefined, (2004); Journal of Sustainability Science and Management, (2006); International Journal of Systems Applications Engineering Development, (2007); International Journal of Energy and Environment, (2007); Jusoff, Kamaruzaman, Search and rescue (SAR) operations for the missing Bell 206 Long Ranger helicopter in Sarawak, Malaysia using near real-time airborne hyperspectral imaging system, Disaster Prevention and Management: An International Journal, 17, 1, pp. 94-103, (2008); Journal of Computer Information Science, (2008)","H.

Although maps have always been a focal point for developing situational awareness, the dawning era of network-centric operations brings the promise of unprecedented battlefield advantage due to improved geospatial situational awareness. Geographic information systems (GIS) and GIS-based decision support systems are ubiquitous within current military forces, as well as civil and humanitarian organizations. Understanding the quality of geospatial data is essential to using it intelligently. A systematic approach to data quality requires: estimating and describing the quality of data as they are collected; recording the data quality as metadata; propagating uncertainty through models for data processing; exploiting uncertainty appropriately in decision support tools; and communicating to the user the uncertainty in the final product. There are shortcomings in the state-of-the-practice in GIS applications in dealing with uncertainty. No single point solution can fully address the problem. Rather, a system-wide approach is necessary. Bayesian reasoning provides a principled and coherent framework for representing knowledge about data quality, drawing inferences from data of varying quality, and assessing the impact of data quality on modeled effects. Use of a Bayesian approach also drives a requirement for appropriate probabilistic information in geospatial data quality metadata. This paper describes our research on data quality for military applications of geospatial reasoning, and describes model views appropriate for model builders, analysts, and end users. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Imaging spectroscopy is a relatively fully-fledged experimental tool that has been successfully used in the laboratory by physicists and chemists for over 100 years for identification of materials and their composition. Absorption features accord to the special chemical bound of a material, which can be calculated by imaging spectroscopy. With the demand of earth observation, imaging spectroscopy technique has extended to the detection and mapping of materials by satellite imagery. Since the 1980s, geologists have used sensors on the man-made satellite to obtain the spectrum of every position in a large scale in the ground which combines a datacube which combines the imaging and spectroscopy in a single system. That's to say that hyperspectral remote sensing not only contain spatial features but also spectral features of the ground objects. But it doesn't refer to the remote sensing imagery with only several bands, such as Landsat TM or Modis imagery. In fact, the most significant difference between hyperspectral remote sensing and these multispectral remote sensing is that it has much more bands with much higher spectral resolution. Hyperspectral remote sensing usually has over one hundred bands with a spectral resolution of under 10 nm. Fig. 9.1 shows the concept about hyperspectral remote sensing imagery which usually comprises of datacube with a series of images. In this case, it provides a better discrimination among similar targets. On the other hand, subtle spectral differences would be hidden in spectra acquired with multispectral remote sensing with broad spectral band sensors. Hyperspectral remote sensing has been widely used in many civil and military applications such as geology, agriculture, and global change, defense, intelligence, and law enforcement. The aim of the chapter is to discuss the basic data processing and analysis techniques for hyperspectral remote sensing such as feature selection, classification, mixed pixel unmixing etc. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Journal of Geophysical Research, (1986); Bagan, Hasi, Land cover classification from MODIS EVI times-series data using SOM neural network, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 26, 22, pp. 4999-5012, (2005); Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra, Multiobjective genetic clustering for pixel classification in remote sensing imagery, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 45, 5, pp. 1506-1511, (2007); Pattern Recognition with Fuzzy Objective Function Algorithms, (1981); Remote Sensing of Environment, (1986); Bruzzone, Lorenzo, An Extension of the Jeffreys-Matusita Distance to Multiclass Cases for Feature Selection, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 33, 6, pp. 1318-1321, (1995); Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity, (1959); Theoretical Immunology, (1978); Introduction to Remote Sensing, (2002); Carter, Jerome H., The immune system as a model for pattern recognition and classification, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 7, 1, pp. 28-41, (2000)","","","Springer US","","","","","","","9781441900494","","","English","Geospatial Technol. for Earth Observ.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892261483"

This optical imaging project is conducted by the French National Space Agency, CNES. It will operate two satellites designed to provide optical images to civilian and military users. The first satellite will be ready for launch by April 2010, the second 18 months later. It will allow, in Nadir acquisition conditions, to deliver image products 20 km wide, false or natural coloured scenes with a 50 cm ground sampling distance. Imaging capabilities have been highly optimized in order to acquire, in the same pass, along-track mosaics, stereo pairs and triplets, and multi-targets. To fulfil the operational requirements and ensure quick access to information, ground processing has to automatically perform the radiometric and geometric corrections. Since ground processing capabilities have been taken into account very early in the mission development, it has been possible to relax some costly on-board components requirements, in order to achieve a cost effective on-board/ground compromise. Starting from a Pleiades-HR system overview, this paper gives a quick description of the ground segment functional breakdown and focuses more precisely on the image processing and associated products.

In most domestic and overseas meteorological departments, the method to measure visibility is by eyeballing, which lacks criteria and objectivity. Among the instruments for visibility measurement, lidar is a powerful tool by directly collecting the backscattering laser light from the atmosphere. During the 2006 Qingdao International Sailing Regatta, atmospheric horizontal visibility was measured by an eye-safe Micropulsed lidar (MPL) which was developed by the Ocean Remote Sensing Laboratory (ORSL) of the Ocean University of China (OUC) in Xiaomai island (36°3'9.91''N, 120°25'37.10''E) from August 18 to 29, 2006. Klett method was used for processing the data measured from MPL. In this 12 days period, the visibility ranges from 1km to 30 km, covering many different weather conditions. The MPL operated stably at all times including the continual measurement from August 21 to 23, 2006 for both days and nights. Simultaneous eye observation data from Qingdao Meteorological Bureau were obtained for comparison. Visibility results of MPL system show good agreement with the eye observations data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.88. Experiments and comparisons successfully prove the capability and feasibility of the MPL system for atmospheric visibility. © 2009 IEEE.","Aerosol; Extinction coefficient; Micro-pulsed lidar; Visibility","Atmospheric visibility; Basic parameters; Correlation coefficient; Extinction coefficient; Eye-safe; Horizontal visibility; Laser lights; Micro-pulsed lidar; Observation data; Ocean remote sensing; Pulsed lidar; Qingdao; Visibility measurements; Weather conditions; Atmospheric aerosols; Data processing; Environmental engineering; Military operations; Oceanography; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Visibility","","","","","","","Chinese Science Bulletin, (1999); Spinhirne, James D., Micro Pulse Lidar, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 31, 1, pp. 48-55, (1993)","G.

From dedicated data acquisition and processing systems, we have realized multi-mission data acquisition quick look and browse systems and also multi-mission integrated information management systems. Front end of data reception station has been upgraded to handle wider bandwidth and data rates up to 320 Mbps for near future missions such as the Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT). Antenna, feed, down converters and RF chain have been upgraded. To cater to multi-mission scenario mission independent, fully configurable demodulator/bit synchs have been deployed. For handling data acquisition in multi-satellite scenario where in data from 5 to 6 remote sensing satellites are to be received almost simultaneously, automation of operations has been incorporated towards station configuration to avoid manual errors. From media-based data handling, there has been a shift towards net centric data handling among the various work centers such as user order processing, data processing systems, special processing systems, data quality evaluation, and product quality control work centers. The turn around time for dissemination of user desired data products has been improved from two weeks to one day. Presently a state of the art integrated environment has been envisaged which will bring down the turn around time for the supply of data products significantly. Automation has been incorporated at both data acquisition and data processing to improve the product throughput. Presently NRSA is catering to a demand of about 30,000 data products per annum and in the next two years it is aimed to reach a level of 50,000 products per annum by realizing the integrated multi-mission ground system for earth observation (IMGEOS). This will significantly modify the entire data production and dissemination chain so that data can be made available to user within 1 h from data acquisition at Shadnagar in some cases. Some of these novel developments planned in the near future will be discussed in this paper. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Such data sharing will also be a part of the future design of a tower flux observation network in Asia. The aim of this review is to comprehend the state of tower flux observation sites in Asia. There are 109 tower flux observation sites in Asia including 51 forest sites. There are more new sites under construction in Asia than in America and Europe. These sites range from the taiga in Siberia to the rainforest in Southeast Asia, and from the equatorial to polar Koeppen climate zones. There are many highly humid areas in Asia, not only at low latitudes but also at middle latitudes. This climate condition has developed unique vegetation such as lucidophyllous (evergreen broadleaf) forest, which is distributed in warm areas with high precipitation in the growing season. However, there are only a few observations taking place in lucidophyllous forest. Rice paddy fields are also unique land cover in Asia. It is important to accumulate long-term data for rice fields with their management records, because plant activity depends highly on both climate conditions and land-use management. Flux data, especially net ecosystem exchange and related elements, are used for widespread studies not only within the flux-research community but also in other fields of study, for example remote sensing. At present, however, both the quantity and quality of the data are not sufficient for these studies. Regarding the quantity, there are many recently established sites that have not published data yet; regarding quality, flux data include uncertainties caused by methodological problems. Flux researchers are required not only to obtain flux data but also to improve their quality. Meanwhile, data users must understand there are still uncertainties in flux data. © 2008 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer.","Asia; Carbon dioxide; Climate; Flux observation site; Vegetation","Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Land use; Metadata; Military operations; Oxides; Records management; Remote sensing; Theorem proving; Vegetation; America; Asia; Climate; Climate conditions; Climate zones; Data sharing; Data users; Flux observation site; Forest sites; Future designs; Growing seasons; Humid areas; Land covers; Lucidophyllous forests; Methodological problems; Net ecosystem exchanges; Plant activities; Research communities; Rice fields; Rice paddies; Under constructions; Towers; atmospheric chemistry; boreal forest; broad-leaved forest; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate conditions; data processing; data quality; flux measurement; growing season; land cover; paddy field; rainforest; vegetation dynamics; Carbon Dioxide; Land Use; Military Engineering; Plants; Remote Sensing; Eurasia","","","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT","Acknowledgments We would like to thank the principal investigators of flux observation sites and many other people, for providing site information, and the network management sub-work group of AsiaFlux (leader: Yasumi Fujinuma) and the database management sub-work group (leader: Takashi Hirano) for supporting our work, especially Naishen Liang, for apprising us of the situation in China, and Yoshikazu Kobayashi, for preparing the format of the site information and contacting many principal investigators of flux observation sites.

Practical applications will typically require real-time processing of large data volumes recorded by a hyperspectral imager. This paper investigates the use of graphics processing units (GPU) for such real-time processing. In particular, the paper studies a hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithm based on normal mixture modelling of the background spectral distribution, a computationally demanding task relevant to military target detection and numerous other applications. The algorithm parts are analysed with respect to complexity and potential for parallellization. The computationally dominating parts are implemented on an Nvidia GeForce 8800 GPU using the Compute Unified Device Architecture programming interface. GPU computing performance is compared to a multi-core central processing unit implementation. Overall, the GPU implementation runs significantly faster, particularly for highly data-parallelizable and arithmetically intensive algorithm parts. For the parts related to covariance computation, the speed gain is less pronounced, probably due to a smaller ratio of arithmetic to memory access. Detection results on an actual data set demonstrate that the total speedup provided by the GPU is sufficient to enable real-time anomaly detection with normal mixture models even for an airborne hyperspectral imager with high spatial and spectral resolution. © The Author(s) 2008.","Anomaly detection; General purpose GPU processing; Hyperspectral imagery; Multivariate normal mixture model","Anomaly detection; Central processing units; Compute unified device architectures; Data sets; General purpose GPU processing; GPU computing; GPU implementation; GPU processing; Graphics Processing Unit; Hyper-spectral images; Hyperspectral anomaly detection; Hyperspectral imagers; Hyperspectral imagery; Hyperspectral Imaging; Large data volumes; Memory access; Military targets; Multi core; Multivariate normal mixture model; Normal mixture models; Normal mixtures; Other applications; Realtime processing; Spectral distribution; Task relevant; Total speedups; Computer graphics equipment; Data processing; Image coding; Image sensors; Military applications; Mixtures; Program processors; Remote sensing; Target tracking; Radar target recognition","","","","","","Yuliya Tarabalka has received her Bachelor degree in Computer Science (2005) from the Ternopil Ivan Pul’uj State Technical University, Ukraine and M.Sc. degree in Signal and Image Processing (2007) from National Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble (INPG), France.

In particular, the growth of the World Wide Web is contributing to an increase in the global user base. The synergy of remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), Internet, and mobile phone technologies is revolutionizing the way in which satellite-derived information is archived and distributed to users. The Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), a NASA-funded application, is just one of many examples that illustrate the increasing ease with which Earth observation data are accessible to a broad range of users. This paper describes how the delivery of satellite-derived fire information has evolved over the last six years. By understanding user requirements and taking advantage of recent developments in areas such as information management, search, access, visualization, and enabling technologies, FIRMS has expanded the number and range of users that are able to access and utilize satellite-derived fire information. Specifically, we describe how satellite remote sensing and GIS technologies have been integrated to deliver MODIS active fire data to natural resource managers using Internet mapping services and customized e-mail alerts to users in more than 90 countries. We also describe how this web-based desktop application has been transitioned to a mobile service in South Africa to deliver fire information to field staff to warn of fires that may be potentially damaging to both natural resources and infrastructure. © 2006 IEEE.","E-mail alerts; Fire; Internet mapping services; Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); Satellite-derived fire information","Atmospherics; Conformal mapping; Data processing; Electronic mail; Fires; Geographic information systems; Internet; Management; Management information systems; Military operations; NASA; Natural resources management; Observatories; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Resource allocation; Satellites; Spectrometers; Telecommunication equipment; Telephone systems; World Wide Web; Active fires; Desktop applications; E-mail alerts; Earth observation datums; Enabling technologies; Gis technologies; Global products; Infra structures; Internet mapping services; Mobile phone technologies; Mobile services; Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); Real-time monitoring; Recent developments; Resource Management systems; Resource managers; Satellite remote sensing; Sensor characteristics; South Africa; Technological advances; User requirements; Information management; accessibility; data processing; EOS; fire; fire management; GIS; MODIS; remote sensing; resource management; satellite data; visualization; Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","Manuscript received February 1, 2008; revised June 9, 2008.

Imaging using such flexible optical systems bears the problem of structural deformation which results in low quality of the captured images. To compensate for it, the satellite has to have a focusing function in limited techniques. This paper proposes a practical way of auto focusing for such nano-scale remote sensing satellites using fuzzy image processing. The proposed method is independent of photographed objects and does not require tracking of the contrast evaluation areas to be used for conventional auto focusing algorithm, which reduces the on-board computational load and requirement of attitude determination and control very much. © 2008 SPIE.","Auto focusing; Extensible optical structure; Nano-scale remote sensing satellites; PRISM","Communication satellites; Digital image storage; Focusing; Image processing; Imaging systems; Military satellites; Nanostructured materials; Nanotechnology; Optical data processing; Optical systems; Patient monitoring; Photolithography; Prisms; Satellite observatories; Satellites; Signal processing; Attitude determinations; Auto focusing; Computational loads; Contrast evaluations; Extensible optical structure; Focusing algorithms; Focusing functions; Fuzzy image processing; Low qualities; Nano-scale remote sensing satellites; Nanoscale; Optical-; Structural deformations; System flexibilities; Remote sensing","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 15th Annual AIAA Usu Conference on Small Satellites, (2001); Funase, Ryu, Technology demonstration on University of Tokyo's pico-satellite ""XI-V"" and its effective operation result using ground station network, Acta Astronautica, 61, 7-8, pp. 707-711, (2007); 19th Annual AIAA Usu Conference on Small Satellite, (2005); Proc of the 26th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, (2008); Proc of the 26th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, (2008); Code V, (2008); Google Earth","","","","SPIE Europe","Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XIV","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57649116315"

Interferogram formation requires images to be coregistered with an accuracy of better than 1/8 pixel to avoid significant loss of phase coherence. Conventional interferometric precise coregistration methods for full-resolution SAR data (Single-Look Complex imagery, or SLC) are based on the cross-correlation of the SLC data, either in the original complex form or as squared amplitudes. Offset vectors in slant range and azimuth directions are computed on a large number of windows, according to the estimated correlation peaks. Then, a two-dimensional polynomial of a certain degree is usually chosen as warp function and the polynomial parameters are estimated through LMS fit from the shifts measured on the image windows. In case of rough topography and long baselines, the polynomial approximation for the warp function becomes inaccurate, leading to local misregistrations. Moreover, these effects increase with the spatial resolution and then with the sampling frequency of the sensor, as first results on TerraSAR-X interferometry confirm. An improved, DEM-assisted image coregistration procedure can be adopted for providing higher-order prediction of the offset vectors. Instead of estimating the shifts on a limited number of patches and using a polynomial approximation for the transformation, this approach computes pixel by pixel the correspondence between master and slave by using the orbital data and a reference DEM. This study assesses the performance of this approach with respect to the standard procedure. In particular, both analytical relationships and simulations will evaluate the impact of the finite vertical accuracy of the DEM on the final coregistration precision for different radar postings and relative positions of satellites. The two approaches are compared by processing real data at different carrier frequencies and using the interferometric coherence as quality figure. © 2008 SPIE.","Coregistration; Digital Elevation Model (DEM); Interferometry; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Coherent light; Correlation methods; Data processing; Digital instruments; Geomorphology; Image classification; Imaging systems; Interferometers; Interferometry; Medical imaging; Military operations; Photoacoustic effect; Pixels; Polynomials; Radar; Radar antennas; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Surveying; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic apertures; Tracking radar; Vectors; Weaving; Windows; Azimuth directions; Carrier frequencies; Complex forms; Coregistered; Coregistration; Coregistration procedures; Correlation peaks; Digital Elevation Model (DEM); Image alignments; Image windows; Interferogram; Interferometric coherences; Long base lines; Phase coherences; Polynomial parameters; Real datums; Relative positions; Sampling frequencies; Sar datums; SAR interferometries; Slant ranges; SLC datums; Spatial resolutions; Standard procedures; Vertical accuracies; Polynomial approximation","","","","","","","Radar Interferometry Data Interpretation and Error Analysis, (2001); Radargrammetric Image Processing, (1990); Proceedings of Fringe 2007, (2007); Proc Fringe Workshop, (2007); Proceedings of Fringe 2003, (2003); Memoires De Lacademie Des Sciences De Berlin, (1767); Mem Des Savans Etrangers, (1785); Zebker, Howard A., Decorrelation in interferometric radar echoes, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 30, 5, pp. 950-959, (1992); Ferretti, Alessandro, Evaluating the effect of the observation time on the distribution of sar permanent scatterers, European Space Agency, (Special Publication) ESA SP, 550, pp. 167-172, (2004)","D.

The study utilizes GPS data from DFIRST (Deployable Force-on-Force Instrumented Range System) PIP (Participant Instrumentation Package) mounted on training vehicles during a 12 day military training exercise at Camp Atterbury in Indiana in July 2006. Approximately 80 vehicles were tracked each day. One hundred vehicle GPS datasets that consisted of the most data per day were selected for analysis. Vehicle movement patterns (distance traveled, off-road percentages) were determined for each vehicle. The GPS data was used to estimate the site-specific environmental impacts during the maneuvers. Training areas with significant off-road impacts were determined. Off-road vegetative impacts were determined utilizing vehicle-terrain impact models. Quantity and location of off-road impacts were determined. Training areas with severe impacts were determined.

The HELLAS-Warning System has been introduced into the market in 2000, is in service at German Federal Police and Royal Thai Air Force. HELLAS was also successfully evaluated by the Foreign Comparative Test Program (FCT) of the U.S. Army and other governmental agencies. Currently the successor system for military applications, HELLAS-Awareness, is in qualification phase. It will have extended sensor performance, enhanced real-time data processing capabilities and advanced human machine interface (HMI) features. Flight tests on NH90 helicopter have been successfully performed. Helicopter series integration is scheduled to begin from 2009. We will give an outline of the new sensor unit concerning detection technology and helicopter integration aspects. The system provides a widespread field of view with additional dynamic line of sight steering and a large detection range in combination with a high frame rate. We will show the HMI representations. This HELLAS system is the basis for a 3 dimensional see-and-remember-system for brown-out recovery. When landing in sandy or dusty areas the downwash of the helicopter rotor causes clouds of visually-restrictive material that can completely obstruct the pilot's outside reference, resulting in a complete loss of situational awareness and spatial orientation of the pilot which can end up in total loss of aircraft control and dangerous accidents.

LIDAR is a DISC type system (DIfferential SCattering) and is based on analysis of backscattering signal for two wavelengths (λ<inf>1</inf> = 1064 nm and λ<inf>2</inf> = 532 nm) - the first and the second harmonic of Nd:YAG laser. Optical receiving system is consisted of aspherical mirror lens, two additional mirrors and a system of interference filters. In detection system of LIDAR a silicon avalanche photodiode and two different amplifiers were used. Whole system is mounted on a specialized platform designed for possibility of LIDAR scanning movements. LIDAR is computer controlled. The compiled software enables regulation of the scanning platform work, gain control, and control of data processing and acquisition system. In the article main functional elements of LIDAR are shown and typical parameters of system work and construction are presented. One presented also first results of research with use of LIDAR. The aim of research was to detect and characterize scattering aerosol, both natural and anthropogenic one. For analyses of natural aerosols, cumulus cloud was used. For analyses of anthropogenic aerosols one used three various pyrotechnic mixtures (DM11, M2, M16) which generate smoke of different parameters. All scattering centers were firstly well described and theoretical analyses were conducted. Results of LIDAR research were compared with theoretical analyses and general conclusions concerning correctness of LIDAR work and its application were drawn. © 2008 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Aerosols; Scattering lidar; Stand off detection","Atmospheric aerosols; Backscattering; Computer control systems; Concurrency control; Data processing; Electric network analysis; Mirrors; Neodymium lasers; Optical filters; Remote sensing; Scanning; Acquisition systems; Anthropogenic aerosols; Aspherical mirrors; Backscattering signals; Cumulus clouds; Detection systems; Differential scatterings; Functional elements; Interference filters; Lidar scanning; Military university of technologies; Nd : yag lasers; Pyrotechnic mixtures; Receiving systems; Scattering centers; Second harmonics; Silicon avalanche photodiodes; Stand off detection; Two wavelengths; Type systems; Whole systems; Optical radar","","","","","","","Elastic Lidar Theory Practice and Analysis Methods, (2004); Elektronika, (2008)","","","","SPIE Europe","Lidar Technologies, Techniques, and Measurements for Atmospheric Remote Sensing IV","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-60849125715"

The awareness of the underground option among planners, developers, and financiers should be increased so that subsurface planning issues can be better addressed. The lack of adequate and accurate 3D spatial data often makes the design and construction of such underground works difficult. It is necessary to integrate all of the spatial objects for underground planning. Over the past two decades, a number of commercial software systems have been developed for 3D geographic and geological modeling. For example, VGEGIS software allows users to create 3D surface geological maps. 3D GeoModeller, a 3D geological modeling and geophysical inversion package, allows project geologists to build realistic 3D geology models. This paper presents an approach to integrate the geographic and geological models for underground planning. A prototype of 3D Geographic Information System (3DGIS) called ""3DRock"" has been developed by authors to implement the data integration with 3D GeoModeler. The results so far showed that 3DRock is able to integrate the above-surface, surface, and subsurface information available from maps, sections, terrain models, topographic data, drillholes, etc. for the Banyan Basin in Jurong Island, Singapore, in a case study. © 2008 SPIE.","3DGIS; Data integration; Geological model; Multi-source geoscientific data","3d geological modeling; 3D surfaces; 3DGIS; Commercial software systems; Data integration; Design and constructions; Drill holes; Geological maps; Geological model; Geological modeling; Geology models; Geomodeler; Geophysical inversions; Multi-source geoscientific data; Singapore; Spatial datum; Spatial objects; Subsurface informations; Subsurface planning; Terrain models; Topographic datum; Data processing; Geographic information systems; Geologic models; Military applications; Observatories; Three dimensional","","","","","","","undefined, (2009); de Kemp, E.

A UGV that can autonomously perceive its terrain using navigational sensors can make necessary changes to its control strategy. The research presented uses the output of the induced vehicle's vibration measured by navigational sensors to classify the underlying terrain at multiple speeds. The classification algorithm incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and dimension reduction. The PCA transformation coefficients are then used to develop a manifold curve that uses these known coefficients to interpolate unknown coefficients of the terrains as the robot's speed changes. Experimental data is collected using two distinctly different unmanned ground vehicle platforms. Results demonstrate the performance of the method for classifying multi-differentiated terrains broadly classified as grass, asphalt, mud, and gravel. ©2008 IEEE.","","Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Financial data processing; Industrial engineering; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Military applications; Military vehicles; Navigation; Navigation systems; Robotics; Robots; Sensors; Speed; Tanks (military); Unmanned vehicles; Vehicles; Control strategies; International conferences; Navigational sensors; Ground vehicles","","","","","","","Howard, Ayanna M., Vision-based terrain characterization and traversability assessment, Journal of Robotic Systems, 18, 10, pp. 577-587, (2001); Vandapel, Nicolas, Natural terrain classification using 3-D ladar data, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2004, 5, pp. 5117-5122, (2004); Iagnemma, Karl D., On-line terrain parameter estimation for planetary rovers, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 3, pp. 3142-3147, (2002); Iagnemma, Karl D., Terrain estimation for high-speed rough-terrain autonomous vehicle navigation, Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering, 4715, pp. 256-266, (2002); Proceedings of the Florida Conference on Recent Advances in Robotics, (2003); Autonomous Ground Vehicle Terrain Classification Using Internal Sensors, (2004); Brooks, Christopher A., Vibration-based terrain analysis for mobile robots, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2005, pp. 3415-3420, (2005); Ojeda, Lauro V., Terrain characterization and classification with a mobile robot, Journal of Field Robotics, 23, 2, pp. 103-122, (2006); DuPont, Edmond M., Online terrain classification for mobile robots, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Dynamic Systems and Control Division (Publication) DSC, 74 DSC, 2 PART B, pp. 1643-1648, (2005); Proc of the 2006 Florida Conference on Recent Advances in Robotics, (2006)","E.

In this study, taking into consideration of the temporal and spatial variation, a comprehensive analysis is performed about functions which describe the how the cloud indexes affect the ravage of drought. Afterwards, based on this analysis, a modification function is restricted to a certain format, which is finally settled with the parameters retrieved by the remote sensing data accompanied with the measured date about the humidity of the soil deep to 20cm. This modification function is applied to regulate the 3 cloud impaction functions. Finally, the new drought monitoring model is modified by evaluating different weights to three cloud impaction functions. Meanwhile, this new model is applied to the FY-2C data covering the whole land surface of China. Compared with the traditional monitoring algorithms, the new model is proved to be able to offer a more accurate and reliable result in large scale of time and space. © 2008 IEEE.","","Administrative data processing; Data mining; Decision support systems; Drought; Ground operations; Information management; Military operations; Mining; Remote sensing; Space optics; Drought monitoring; Remote sensing data; Mathematical models","","","","","","","undefined, (2008); Modis Seasonal and Inter Annual Responses of Semiarid Ecosystems to Drought in the Southwest Usa J, (2008); Drought Monitoring in the Southeastern Mediteranean Basin Using Satellite Data J, (2008); undefined, (2008); Vegetation Temperature Condition Index and Its Application for Drought Monitoring J, (2008); An Adaptation Analysis of Drought Index in Shanxi Province of China J, (2008); Journal of Yangtze River Scientific Research Institute, (2004); Journal of Wtusm, (1999); Kogan, Felix N., Droughts of the late 1980s in the United States as derived from NOAA polar-orbiting satellite data, Bulletin - American Meteorological Society, 76, 5, pp. 655-668, (1995); Kogan, Felix N., Remote sensing of weather impacts on vegetation in non-homogeneous areas, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 11, 8, pp. 1405-1419, (1990)","L.

And try to offer a general task management and scheduling solution for high performance remote sensing data processing platforms.","Cluster; Ground pre-processing; High performance; Remote sensing satellite; Task scheduling and management","Communication satellites; Data processing; High performance liquid chromatography; Industrial research; Management; Military satellites; Multitasking; Project management; Remote sensing; Satellites; Scheduling algorithms; Space optics; Cluster; Ground pre-processing; High performance; Remote sensing satellite; Task scheduling and management; Scheduling","","","","","","","Distributed Computing Approach for Remote Sensing Data, (2007); Distributed Computing in Ground Processing, (2007); Proceedings of the 22nd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, (2001); Zhang, Wanjun, Special task scheduling and control of cluster parallel computing for high-performance ground processing system, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3993 LNCS - III, pp. 17-23, (2006); Journal of Image and Graphics, (2003); Li, Guoqing, Preliminary through-out research on parallel-based remote sensing image processing, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3991 LNCS - I, pp. 880-883, (2006)","B.

Military tacticians are currently governed by various standards regarding quality requirements for georeferenced imagery and geospatial data sources. In some new generation systems, this imagery provides the basis for generating 3D reference models for input into model-based ATA systems. This paper analyses the criticality of this absolute coordinate accuracy requirement by assessing ATA algorithm performance using 3D reference models created from a variety of commercially available data sources, including aerial and terrestrial photography, and airborne laser scanner data. ATA algorithm performance is analysed using a software tool that uses a variety of open source techniques and image processing functions typically found in tactical, air-to-ground, model-based ATA systems. Each of the 3D reference models, extracted in a number of different areas of interest, was matched against a corresponding sequence of infrared video data. This provided a series of results, which were analysed as a function of both reference model accuracy and object selection and representation. Initial results indicate that the absolute accuracy of the reference models created for this research has a minor impact on ATA algorithm performance when compared with the impact of the content of the reference models, taking into account the complexity of the area of interest. This suggests that a wider array of data sources may be suitable for 3D reference model construction, than is currently accepted.","Air-to-ground; Automatic target acquisition; Model-based ATA; Reference model accuracy; Three-dimensional reference models","(algorithmic) complexity; absolute accuracy; absolute co-ordinate; Airborne laser scanners; Algorithm performance; Analytical methods; Area of Interest (AOI); Areas of interest (AOI); Automatic target acquisition; Data sourcing; Geo-spatial data; Geospatial data sources; Image processing functions; Infrared video; Model based (OPC); new generation; object selection; Open sources; Quality requirements; reference models; Software tools; target recognition; Terrestrial photography; Algorithms; Automatic target recognition; Boolean functions; Computer graphics; Computer software; Data acquisition; Detectors; Evolutionary algorithms; Function evaluation; Image processing; Imaging systems; Imaging techniques; Integer programming; Laser applications; Mergers and acquisitions; Multitasking; Numerical methods; Optical data processing; Paper; Pigments; Pulsed laser deposition; Radar; Scheduling algorithms; Standards; Targets; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics; Mathematical models","","","","","","","undefined, (2008); Spatial Data Transfer Standard, (2007); Tactical Imagery Geospatial Data Support Options for Automatic Target Acquisition, (2008); Dan Currie, G., Standard test targets for automatic target recognizers, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 1307, pp. 433-437, (1990); Ratches, James A., Target acquisition performance modeling of infrared imaging systems: Past, present, and future, IEEE Sensors Journal, 1, 1, pp. 31-40, (2001); Driggers, Ronald G., Synthetic aperture radar target acquisition model based on a national imagery interpretability rating scale to probability of discrimination conversion, Optical Engineering, 42, 7, pp. 2104-2112, (2003); Bijl, Piet, TOD predicts target acquisition performance for staring and scanning thermal imagers, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 4030, pp. 96-103, (2000); Infrared Seekers A Review of the Open Literature on Methods for Targeting of Air to Ground Weapons, (2003); Iratd Image and Wire Frame Projection Techniques for Air to Ground Seekers, (2004); Iratd Feature Based Matching Techniques Performance Results for Air to Ground Seekers, (2005)","N.

Is it possible to have an emergency response/management system that can ""sense"" things that are happening or are going to happen around us and can ""respond"" to those events to help in decision-making and ultimately tell us what we need to do? A geographical information system (GIS) with such features can be used as a disaster response system or emergency management system where events, e.g., earthquakes, oil spills at sea, forest fires, chemical spills, floods, radiological accidents, and car accidents, need to be responded to in real-time (or near-real-time) as they occur. Unfortunately, most GIS systems available on the market are designed to deal with static spatial data and not to analyze and act on fast-moving data or process events in real time. The GIS proposed in this paper is based on Event-Driven and Service-Oriented Architecture. It has ""situational awareness"" that can quickly ""sense-and-respond"" to opportunities and threats and can ""track-and-trace"" important items as they move around. Using such an event-driven-GIS, notable events happening inside or outside the system can be disseminated immediately to all interested parties (human or other applications). The interested parties can then evaluate the event and optionally take actions. The event-driven action may include the invocation of services, the triggering of business processes, and/or further information publication/syndication. In this paper, the overall architecture of emergency management systems using event-driven GIS will be discussed. The major technologies that have been used to implement such systems and the key components, including the remote sensing data processing system, the mobile asset management system, the risks management system, the Internet-based GIS system, and the enterprise service bus (ESB) will be described and analyzed. As an example of emergency management systems, a system for real-time detection of natural gas and oil spills will be presented to demonstrate how to apply the proposed architecture to support real applications.","","Civil defense; Contamination; Data handling; Decision making; Deforestation; Emergency services; Geographic information systems; Information services; Oil spills; Real time systems; Remote sensing; Risk management; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Technical presentations; Asset management systems; Disaster response systems; Emergency management systems; Enterprise service bus; Information publication; Proposed architectures; Radiological accidents; Situational awareness; Information management; Accidents; Data Processing; Disasters; GIS; Hazardous Materials; Insulation; Pollution; Problem Solving; Remote Sensing; Water Pollution","","","","","","","Geospatial Science and Technology, (2002); Brown, Carl E., Laser fluorosensors: A survey of applications and developments of a versatile sensor, Environment Canada Arctic and Marine Oil Spill Program Technical Seminar (AMOP) Proceedings, 24, pp. 485-495, (2001); Principles of Geographical Information Systems, (1998); Service Oriented Architecture A Field Guide to Integrating Xml and Web Services, (2004); Soa Principles of Service Design, (2007); Natural Hazards, (2000); Enterprise Integration Patterns Designing Building and Deploying Messaging Solutions, (2003); Proceedings of Geodesy for Geotechnical and Structural Engineering, (2002); Report and Factsheet Prepared for the Great Lakes Sustainability Fund, (2002); Geographic Information Systems and Science, (2001)","S.

Although maps have always been a focal point for developing situational awareness, the dawning era of Network Centric Operations brings the promise of unprecedented battlefield advantage due to improved geospatial situational awareness. Geographic information systems (GIS) and GIS-based decision support systems are ubiquitous within current military forces, as well as civil and humanitarian organizations. Understanding the quality of geospatial data is fundamental to using it intelligently. A systematic approach to data quality requires: estimating and describing the quality of data as it is collected; recording the data quality as meta data; propagating uncertainty through models for data processing; exploiting uncertainty appropriately in decision support tools; and communicating to the user the uncertainty in the final product. Bayesian reasoning provides a principled and coherent approach to representing and drawing inferences about data quality. This paper describes our research on data quality for military applications of geospatial reasoning, and describes model views appropriate for model builders, analysts, and end users.","","Bayesian reasoning; Decision support tools; Geo-spatial informations; Geospatial reasonings; Gis-based decision support systems; Military planning; Network centric operations; Situational awareness; Artificial intelligence; Data processing; Data reduction; Decision support systems; Geographic information systems; Maps; Military applications; Military mapping; Uncertainty analysis","","","","","","","Bayesian Decision Networks for Watershed Management, (2002); Bayesian Semantics for the Semantic Web, (2005); Proceedings of the Twelfth International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, (2007); Statistics for Spatial Data, (2025); Defense Mapping School Student Text Dms St 330, (1993); Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Machine Learning, (1997); National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis, (1992); Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne, Spatially explicit avalanche risk assessment linking Bayesian networks to a GIS, Natural Hazards and Earth System Science, 6, 6, pp. 911-926, (2006); Ma, Jianwen, Migratory Locust Hazard monitoring and prediction using the Bayesian network inference, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 5, pp. 3623-3626, (2005); Cartography Visualization of Spatial Data, (1996)","","","","","BMA 2007 5th UAI Bayesian Modeling Applications Workshop, UAI-AW 2007","","","","16130073","9789666544899; 9788073780029; 9788024810256; 9789986342748; 9788073781712; 9782954494807; 9788024823911; 9789562361989; 8024810255; 807378002X","","","English","CEUR Workshop Proc.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884995454"

We pursue this argument with a case study integrating a cognitive agent environment (PMFserv) and a social agent environment (FactionSim) and applying them to various regions of interest (Iraq, SE Asia, Crusades) to assess their validity and realism. © 2007 IEEE.","","Financial data processing; Agent based modelling; Case studies; Cognitive agents; Data resources; Data-sets; Regions of interest; Terrain data; Population statistics","","","","","","","Military Review, (2005); de Soto, H., The other path: the invisible revolution in the Third World, The other path: the invisible revolution in the Third World, (1989); Ispere Joint Information Operations Center, (2004); Military Review, (2006); Lewis, W.

While the measurement technology required for laser polarimetry has matured, sophisticated data-processing algorithms have been relatively slow to develop; hence laser-polarimeter data has been typically under-utilized. This paper presents systematic applications of components analysis to laser-polarimeter data that distinguish among electromagnetic-wave scattering characteristics of materials and enable the development of adaptive discrimination and monitoring algorithms that are invariant to selected variables in a scene. Both principal-components analysis (PCA) and non-linear components analysis are used to derive orientation- or pose-invariant channels from Mueller matrices measured over all probe angles. Invariant channels trained by using data due to isotropic scatterers are then used to conduct blind monitoring, i. e., predicting the presence of the target in a scene of arbitrary orientation, with the resulting cluster diagrams presented with photos of the illuminated scene components. Training of a monitor invariant over dual variables is demonstrated using data due to anisotropic scatterers.","Laser polarimetry; Mueller matrix polarimetry; Remote sensing; Scattering","Arbitrary orientations; Electromagnetic (EM); Measurement technologies; Monitor (CO); Monitoring algorithms; Mueller matrices; Non-imaging; Non-linear; Probe angles; Probe characteristics; Processing algorithms; Systematic (CO); Wave scattering; Adaptive algorithms; Detectors; Electromagnetism; Ellipsometry; Graphic methods; Ground operations; Lasers; Military operations; Polarimeters; Polarization; Pulsed laser deposition; Remote sensing; Space optics; Data processing","","","","","","","Ellipsometry and Polarized Light, (1977); Lewis, Gareth D., Backscatter linear and circular polarization analysis of roughened aluminum, Applied Optics, 37, 25, pp. 5985-5992, (1998); Hoover, Brian G., Active detection of off-diagonal Mueller elements of rough targets, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5158, pp. 226-238, (2003); DeBoo, Brian J., Depolarization of diffusely reflecting man-made objects, Applied Optics, 44, 26, pp. 5434-5445, (2005); Silverman, Mark P., Object delineation within turbid media by backscattering of phase-modulated light, Optics Communications, 144, 1-3, pp. 7-11, (1997); Lewis, Gareth D., Backscattering target detection in a turbid medium by polarization discrimination, Applied Optics, 38, 18, pp. 3937-3944, (1999); Kartazayeva, S.

They are an airborne, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar and LIDAR multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors. One of the advance methods of feasibility study of appropriate services for monitoring of integration systems is based on remote sensing data and GIS developments. Objective of this approach is to improve safety, security aspects of integration systems, reduce survey costs and improve transportation and transmission efficiency through an increased monitoring frequency. Conceptually monitoring the integration system is structured into four main system components: - the Pipeline Operator System (POS), which is the part of the monitoring system which is used by the pipeline operator for delivery and handling of alarms and for specifying the monitoring characteristics for different parts of the pipeline network. - the Pipeline Information Management System (PIMS), which stores all relevant information on the pipeline network, the environment around it, and the integrity monitoring and which provides analyses and scheduling functionalities for the pipeline operator. The PIMS also includes an alarm production system, which decides what hazards should be considered as alarms. - the Hazard Extraction System (HES), which extracts the hazard report information out of the basic remote sensing imagery layers, using advanced image interpretation techniques. - the imagery Collection System (ICS), which collects the required remote sensing imagery with a suit of both spaceborne and airborne platforms and different types of sensors, conform the monitoring priorities. In the ICS all these means are scheduled optimally conform the specified priorities of the pipeline operators and the weather and season conditions. Here also the data are pre-processed to remote sensing basic imagery layers. The four components in principle can be independent of each other so that maximal flexibility exists. Also each system component in itself is set up as much as possible in a modular and flexible way. By implementation of this above mentioned issues, new technologies on sensors, platforms, data processing, data storage and transfer can be integrated and the system easily can be extended to other operators or areas. The future integration systems monitoring scenarios can only be turned into reality if sufficient supply from spaceborne data will be available for reasonable economic conditions and with certain technical performance. Earth observation for appropriate investigation requires very high resolution optical and in most cases radar sensors. Very high resolution is here defined as a resolution of 1 meter and better. This scale is required to allow the detection of targets. Very high resolution satellite observation, formerly limited to national and strictly classified reconnaissance tasks, has become a commercial business in the recent years. However, national security users are still the basis for the commercial viability of that business. Affected by satellites losses and pioneered with Space Imaging's IKONOS satellite, better than 1 meter resolution optical data is now available for science and commercial use. © 2007 IEEE.","Database; GIS; High resolution; Image processing; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Security; Space image; Space technology","Accident prevention; Administrative data processing; Aerospace industry; Alarm systems; Automobile parts and equipment; Data processing; Data storage equipment; Decision making; Detectors; Extraction; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Ground operations; Image analysis; Imaging systems; Imaging techniques; Industry; Information management; Insulating materials; Intelligent control; Management; Management information systems; Metric system; Military operations; Monitoring; Observatories; Optical radar; Optical sensors; Pipelines; Planning; Production control; Quality assurance; Radar; Reliability; Remote sensing; Resource allocation; Satellites; Scheduling; Sensors; Space optics; Space research; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic apertures; Technology; Technology transfer; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles; Vehicle transmissions; (I ,J) conditions; Airborne platforms; commercial businesses; Commercial uses; Commercial viability; Data storage; Different types; Earth Observation (EO); Economic conditioning; Extraction systems; Feasibility studies; Flexible way; High resolutions; Hyper-spectral sensors; ikonos satellite; image interpretation; Information management systems; Integrated Systems (CO); integration systems; Integrity monitoring; international conferences; Monitoring frequency; Monitoring systems; Multi-spectral (MS); National securities; New technologies; OF sensors; Optical (PET) (OPET); Optical data; Pipeline networks; Pipeline operators; production systems; Radar sensors; Relevant information; Remote sensing (RS) data; Remote sensing imagery; Space imagery; Space Imaging (CO); Space technology (ST); Space-borne; Spaceborne data; system components; Technical performance; Transmission efficiencies; Unmanned aerial vehicle (mini-UAV); Very high resolution (VHR); Very high resolution satellite; Optical systems","","","","","","","","S.

These field studies, which were sponsored by the DOD Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), were designed to determine the feasibility of developing and evaluating low-cost methods for determining emission factors for military aircraft engines. The Optical remote sensing measurement technology has the advantage of probing plumes remotely to perform in-situ measurements without requiring direct contact of hardware with the very hot gases near the engine exhaust. Thus, ORS technology has the potential of performing emission measurements on aircraft exhaust faster and at lower cost than the traditional plume extractive methods. As of this writing, we have made measurements on a C-130 turbo prop, a B-52 jet, and an F-15 fighter jet. The suite of optical instruments includes Open-Path FTIR (OP-FTIR), Open-Path UV (OP-UV), Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) sensors and Laser Transmissometers (LT). These instruments were set up in cross-plume configurations, ~ 20 meters behind the engine exhaust plane (EEP) for the two jets and 5 meters behind the turboprop EEP. These instruments were configured to determine path-integrated concentrations (PIC) of gases and particulate matter (PM), their spatial and temporal distribution in the plume, and the plume flow velocity near the optical measurement plane. This information was used to determine emission rates and emission factors for carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), formaldehyde, acetylene, ethylene, propylene, fuel components and PM. In this paper, we will describe the gas and particulate measurements that were made on a B-52 engine plume.","","Aircraft engines; Aircraft instruments; Bombers; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Engines; Ethylene; Exhaust gases; Exhaust systems (engine); Flow velocity; Flowmeters; Meteorological instruments; Military aircraft; Nitric oxide; Optical data processing; Propylene; Remote sensing; Supersonic aircraft; Waste management; Emission measurement; Environmental researches; Measurement technologies; Optical measurement; Optical remote sensing; Path-integrated concentrations; Spatial and temporal distribution; Tunable diode lasers; Fighter aircraft","","","","","","","Annual Meeting of A WMA, (2007); Annual Meeting of A WMA, (2007); Annual Meeting of A WMA, (2007); Haaland, David M., APPLICATION OF NEW LEAST-SQUARES METHODS FOR THE QUANTITATIVE INFRARED ANALYSIS OF MULTICOMPONENT SAMPLES., Applied Spectroscopy, 36, 6, pp. 665-673, (1982); undefined, (2004); Sharpe, Steven W., Gas-phase databases for quantitative infrared spectroscopy, Applied Spectroscopy, 58, 12, pp. 1452-1461, (2004)","","","Air and Waste Management Association info@awma.org","3M; Alcoa; Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD); Amec; Calgon Carbon Corporation; et al.","100th Annual Conference and Exhibition of the Air and Waste Management Association 2007, ACE 2007","2007-06-26 through 2007-06-29","Pittsburgh","112196","","9781604238464","","","English","Annu.

Numerous change detection techniques have been developed since the successful launch of Landsat 1 in 1972. Because of the constant improvements of spatial resolutions and other image characteristics of available airborne/spaceborne electro-optic imagery, object-based change detection is becoming available and is often required in civilian and military application area. However, many challenges have been brought for the traditional change detection to implement the object-based change detection among high resolution images. For example, the post-classification comparison method is very popular and widely used in change detection, but when it is used in object-based change detection, the problem is that it is difficult to classify the interested objects correctly. This paper has introduced a change detection method which is based on the machine learning algorithm, which can overcome the traditional change detection method limitation and find the interested changed objects. High resolution airborne imagery is used to test the method.","Airborne; Change detection; High resolution; Spaceborne","Airborne; Airborne imagery; Change detection; Comparison methods; Constant improvement; High resolution; High resolution image; Image characteristics; Image processing and analysis; LANDSAT; Object based; Post classification; Space-borne; Spatial resolution; Image processing; Information retrieval; Information science; Learning algorithms; Military photography; Optical data processing; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Signal detection","","","","","","","Carleer, Alexandre P., Assessment of very high spatial resolution satellite image segmentations, Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 71, 11, pp. 1285-1294, (2005); Proceedings of the International Esri User Conference Proceedings, (2003); Singh, Ashbindu, Review Articlel: Digital change detection techniques using remotely-sensed data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 10, 6, pp. 989-1003, (1989); Visual Learning Systems, (2002)","G.

The use of digital tools for mapping, planning and preparation is also increasing. Especially for MOUT, new methods and procedures for using the tools are needed. One key factor is the complexity of the operating environment. Therefore, access to updated and detailed geographic (terrain) information and/or 3D-models of the environment is often a key factor for mission success. However, in many situations this kind of information is sparse, not up to date or even unavailable. To address this problem, especially in the case of international operations, a combination of available methods and procedures for data acquisition will most likely be used. These include downloading available data from the internet, purchasing of commercial data (maps, satellite images) or acquisition of new data using various types of (surveillance) sensors followed by extraction of geospatial intelligence data using own resources or in collaboration with others. In this paper we will address the problems involved with supplying updated and detailed geographic (terrain) information and/or 3D-models for urban operations. We will present ongoing projects at the Swedish defence research agency (FOI) dealing with these problems. The focus for one of the projects is the development of new methods in data processing aimed for applications such as rapid 3D visualisation, recognised environment picture, decision support, mission planning, mission rehearsal, etc. The methods include ground estimation, 3D reconstruction of buildings and single tree identification and characterisation. The long term objective is an automatic production chain from environment data collection to geospecific environment models. Another project is a joint project with The Swedish Army Combat School (MSS Kvarn). This project is aimed at developing a new extensive high-resolution reference dataset for the urban environment of the city of Norrköping. This data set (and the project) is referred to as DigNor (Digital Norrköping). The data set contains many different types of data and has a high degree of detail, e.g. an elevation model with post spacing of 0.25m, geospecific building models and properties of individual trees such as position, height and crown diameter. The database also contains high detail infrastructure and demographic information. The data set is intended for use in many applications, such as development of MOUT methodology for Swedish armed forces, research and development in sensor technology, decision support, data and information fusion, exercise planning and execution and blue force tracking.","Environment models; Laser scanning; Mission planning; Mission preparation; Urban operations","Environment models; Laser scanning; Mission planning; Mission preparation; Urban operations; Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Digital devices; Forestry; Interoperability; Maintenance; Military operations; Network security; Sensors; Three dimensional computer graphics; Urban planning; Three dimensional","","","","","","","Proceedings of Image 2005, (2012); Lagesrapport Avseende Studieforsok Inom Studie Mout 2010, (2005); Urban Operations in the Year 2020, (2003); Fourth International Airborne Remote Sensing Conference and Exhibition 21st Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing, (1999); Proceedings of the ISPRS Working Group III 3 Workshop 3 D Reconstruction from Airborne Laserscanner and Insar Data, (2003); Persson, Åsa, Detecting and measuring individual trees using an airborne laser scanner, Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 68, 9, pp. 925-932, (2002); Holmgren, Johan, Identifying species of individual trees using airborne laser scanner, Remote Sensing of Environment, 90, 4, pp. 415-423, (2004)","U.

Autonomous navigation arguably remains the key enabling issue behind any realistic commercial success in these areas. Consequently, autonomous robotic research has focused on large scale and long term navigation algorithms, sensing technologies, robust sensor data interpretation and map building. The recent breakthroughs which contribute to the success of outdoor field robotics, and remaining fundamental research issues involved, will be the theme of this presentation. The most successful robot navigation algorithms to-date, have been derived from a probabilistic perspective, which takes into account vehicle motion and terrain uncertainty and sensor noise. Over the past decade, an explosion of interest in the estimation of an autonomous robot's location state, and that of its surroundings, known as simultaneous localisation and map building (SLAM), is evident. New algorithms which represent uncertain information based on particle filters and Gaussian mixture models, as well as the more classical Kalman filter based techniques, are advancing the progress of a robot's long term navigation abilities. This has been significantly aided by recently affordable sensor technologies, including GPS and inertial measurement units (IMUs) as well as fast and reliable laser range finders. To demonstrate the state of the art in autonomous navigation, outdoor research experiments will be demonstrated within complex, built environments, jungle terrain and in the under water domain with an array of vehicles, using RADAR, underwater SONAR and laser range finders. Finally, new research, which correctly addresses the, often previously ignored, fundamental issues of observability, sensed target classification and sensor biases will also be presented. With affordable new hardware, and a wealth of new estimation techniques, autonomous robot technology is entering a new era in which applications within complex environments becomes achievable. ©2006 IEEE.","","Automation; Autonomous underwater vehicles; Biomimetics; Conformal mapping; Control theory; Detectors; Estimation; Experiments; Inertial navigation systems; Lasers; Maps; Military data processing; Navigation; Navigation systems; Oceanography; Offshore oil well production; Pulsed laser deposition; Range finders; Research; Robotics; Sensors; Technology; Underwater acoustics; Vehicles; Wave filters; Airborne Surveillance; Autonomous navigation; Autonomous robots; Built up areas; complex environments; Estimation techniques; Field robotics; Filter based; Fundamental research; Gaussian mixture model (GMM); Inertial Measurement Units (IMU); international conferences; Large scales; Laser range finder (LRF); Localisation; Long term; map building; Navigation algorithms; Particle filter (PF); Robot navigation; Robust sensors; Search and rescue (SAR) operations; Sensing technologies; sensor biases; Sensor noises; Sensor technologies; State of the arts; Target Classification; Uncertain informations; Underwater exploration; vehicle motion; Robots","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS); Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ); Japanese Society of Mechanical Engineers (JSME); Peking University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Yunnan University","2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, ROBIO 2006","","","","","1424405718; 9781424405718","","","English","IEEE Int.

It is applied successfully in the Fourier transform and wavelet transform of optical image. Compared with computer software or special integrated circuit in image processing, the processing speed of this system on optical image is greatly improved. Liquid crystal light valve is used in this system, so the transform from incoherent light to coherent light is realized. And the optical system design is only required to adapt to the demand of coherent light, so the system will not be restricted by the demand of coherent light when it is applied in the robot vision system. At the same time, it has the following advantages: low cost, parallel processing and large capacity. So the performance of optical system is improved. This system can be applied extensively in the fields of feature extraction on object edge, image filtering, image compression and image correlation identification. The experimental result indicates that the program of this robot vision system is feasible and it has flexible structure, wide scope of application and ideal effect. As a result, there is extensive application prospect in the fields of imaging, optical calculating, remote sensing, security, military affairs and so on.","Liquid crystal light valve; Optical wavelet transform; Robot vision","Coherent light; Data processing; Fourier transforms; Integrated circuits; Liquid crystals; Optical systems; Remote sensing; Robots; Wavelet transforms; Liquid crystal light valve; Optical wavelet transform; Robot vision system; Computer vision","","","","","","","Dai, Shijie, Design of a robot vision sensor based on optical wavelet transform, Guangdian Gongcheng/Opto-Electronic Engineering, 31, 1, pp. 52-54, (2004); Mendlovic, David, Continuous two–dimensional on–axis optical wavelet transformer and wavelet processor with white-light illumination, Applied Optics, 37, 8, pp. 1279-1282, (1998); Fengchun, Tian Chun, A human vision inspired optical wavelet filter for image data compression, Proceedings of the World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA), 5, pp. 4016-4019, (2004); Szu, Harold Hwaling, Wavelet transform as a bank of the matched filters, Applied Optics, 31, 17, pp. 3267-3277, (1992); Esteve-Taboada, José Juan, Two-dimensional optical wavelet decomposition with white-light illumination by wavelength multiplexing, Journal of the Optical Society of America A: Optics and Image Science, and Vision, 18, 1, pp. 157-163, (2001); Lee, Jiann Shu, Multiscale Corner Detection by Using Wavelet Transform, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 4, 1, pp. 100-104, (1995); Sun, Guilin, New method of localizing front focal plane of a lens, Yingyong Jiguang/Applied Laser Technology, 16, 3, pp. 133-134, (1996); Optics Optoelectronic Technology, (2004); J Huazhong Univ of Sci Tech, (1997); Zhao, Jianlin Lin, Two methods for collimating extended laser beam and determining its collimation, Guangdianzi Jiguang/Journal of Optoelectronics Laser, 9, 3, pp. 232-234, (1998)","T.

The world geometric data of an extensive region or terrain may need to be divided in areas, which are distributed across the network. By distributing the data, host memory use and processing power are reduced since less data needs to be received, processed and stored. However, these gains can be easily surpassed by the amount of traffic generated by the synchronization messages transmitted, as well as the processing time due to the control infrastructure and the bulky data transmission of parts of the distributed VE. So, good mechanisms for data distribution management (DDM) are an important requirement for LDVEs. This paper describes the Grid Filtered Region-Based (GFRB) DDM scheme, which combines the positive aspects of both Region-Based and Grid-Based DDM methods to reduce network traffic and latency in LDVEs using a minimum number of multicast groups. GFRB scheme is unique because it provides a finer grained mechanism to exact match publishers to subscribers with intersecting regions. It does that with a reduced number of messages and multicast groups, by taking into consideration the percentage of overlap of a region on a cell. Experimental results show that GFRB scheme can be a potential solution to data synchronization in Large Distributed Virtual Environments.","Data distribution managament; Data filtering; Data synchronization; Large-scale distributed virtual environments","Data processing; Data transfer; Information management; Multicasting; Telecommunication traffic; Virtual reality; Data distribution managament; Data synchronization; Large-scale distributed virtual environments; Distributed computer systems","","","","","","","Extensible Interest Management for Scalable Persistent Distributed Virtual Environments, (1999); ACM Symposium on VR Software and Technology, (1998); Barrus, John W., Locales: Supporting large multiuser virtual environments, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 16, 6, pp. 50-57, (1996); Boukerche, Azzedine, Dynamic grid-based approach to data distribution management, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 62, 3, pp. 366-392, (2002); Proc of the 2000 Summer Computer Simulation Conference Canada; 38th Scs IEEE Annual Simulation Symposium, (2005); 13th Workshop on Standards for the Interoperability of Distributed Simulations, (1995); Capps, Michael V., NPSNET-V: A new beginning for dynamically extensible virtual environments, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 20, 5, pp. 12-15, (2000); Carlsson, Christer, DIVE - a multi-user virtual reality systems, 1993 IEEE Annual Virtual Reality International Symposium, pp. 394-400, (1993); undefined, (2007)","A.

As a member of Team Raptor, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed a self-contained passive perception system under the DARPA funded PerceptOR program. An environmentally protected forward-looking sensor head was designed and fabricated in-house to straddle an off-the-shelf pan-tilt unit. The sensor head contained three color cameras for multi-baseline daytime stereo ranging, a pair of cooled mid-wave infrared cameras for nighttime stereo ranging, and supporting electronics to synchronize captured imagery. Narrow-baseline stereo provided improved range data density in cluttered terrain, while wide-baseline stereo provided more accurate ranging for operation at higher speeds in relatively open areas. The passive perception system processed stereo images and outputted over a local area network terrain maps containing elevation, terrain type, and detected hazards. A novel software architecture was designed and implemented to distribute the data processing on a 533MHz quad 7410 PowerPC single board computer under the VxWorks real-time operating system. This architecture, which is general enough to operate on N processors, has been subsequently tested on Pentium-based processors under Windows and Linux, and a Sparc based-processor under Unix. The passive perception system was operated during FY04 PerceptOR program evaluations at Fort A. P. Hill, Virginia, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. This paper discusses the Team Raptor passive perception system hardware and software design, implementation, and performance, and describes a road map to faster and improved passive perception.","Autonomous navigation; FPGA; Infrared; Parallel processing; Passive perception; Sensor head; Stereo vision","Cameras; Computer architecture; Computer operating systems; Computer software; Field programmable gate arrays; Infrared radiation; Navigation; Parallel processing systems; Propulsion; Stereo vision; Autonomous navigation; Passive perception; Sensor head; Unmanned vehicles","","","","","","","Team Raptor Perceptor Phase III Final Report, (2004); Bellutta, Paolo, Terrain perception for DEMO III, IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, Proceedings, pp. 326-331, (2000); Matthies, Larry H., Detecting water hazards for autonomous off-road navigation, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5083, pp. 231-242, (2003); Huertas, Andrés, Stereo-based tree traversability analysis for autonomous off-road navigation, Proceedings - Seventh IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision, WACV 2005, pp. 210-217, (2005); Ansar, Adnan I., Enhancement of stereo at range discontinuities, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5422, pp. 24-35, (2004); Ansar, Adnan I., Enhanced real-time stereo using bilateral filtering, Proceedings - 2nd International Symposium on 3D Data Processing, Visualization, and Transmission. 3DPVT 2004, pp. 455-462, (2004); Matthies, Larry H., Negative Obstacle Detection by Thermal Signature, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 1, pp. 906-913, (2003)","A.L.

The data from HYDROS is expected to produce breakthroughs in our understanding of processes linking the water, energy, and carbon cycles. The accurate measurement of soil moisture has applications ranging from weather prediction and reservoir management, to meteorological nowcasting in support of military mobility and decision making. In this paper we will review a variety of applications that demonstrate the growing need for a software architecture that is scalable and supports rapid prototyping and validation of remote sensing algorithms. In addition, we will discuss why the assimilation of new data sources, as they become available, must be an integral part of this architecture. Array Systems Computing Inc. (Array) has developed a Scalable Generic Signal Processing architecture that has been used to rapidly prototype the HYDROS satellite active radar processing. Array is currently under contract with ESA to develop the SMOS Level 2 Soil Moisture Prototype Processor. Typically, only 14% of available satellite data from operational Earth observing systems are used today. Due to the lack of efficient data assimilation tools, and in order to reduce data management problems, much of the data is simply discarded. Also, current models of the emissivity of snow and sea ice and the effects of cloud are incomplete and often unusable, which again results in the culling of data. Compounding the problem of the under utilization of the data is the fact that there will be an increase by five-orders of magnitude in the available satellite data from 2000 to 2010 (illustrated in Figure 1 below). This increase in the availability of satellite data, and the requirement to improve models and not discard data, demands the availability of scalable high performance computing systems for future remote sensing applications. In order to take advantage of the synergy between different satellite observation systems, ground processors need to be flexible in order to merge data from new sensors as they come online. For example, there is a synergy between NASA's Hydrosphere States (HYDROS) and ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions, which can be utilized by merging or fusing these data sources. The combined HYDROS/SMOS measurements sample most of the Earth's surface in 1 to 2 days. By combining the SMOS multi-angle measurements with the HYDROS single-incidence angle measurements, greater precision and calibration stability is achieved. The growing demand for greater accuracy and faster delivery of soil moisture products requires future satellite ground processors to be flexible and scalable, thereby allowing new or revised time series filtering algorithms to be implemented as soon as they become available. For example, a synergy exists between the two HYDROS sensors, which can be used to produce better resolution products through the use of time series filtering. The first HYDROS sensor is a passive L-band microwave coarse resolution radiometer, and the second sensor is an active L-band fine-resolution radar (these two sensors have different spatial resolutions and different errors associated with them). Research is currently being done on the feasibility of generating a median resolution soil moisture product by combining both the radiometer and radar observations with the use of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The data assimilation of satellite measurements into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models is an area of active research. In operational NWP calculations, the unobserved state of the system is updated when new data becomes available, which can be calculated using covariance recursions (""Estimation of High-dimensional Prior and Posterior Covariance Matrices in Kalman Filter Variants"", Furrer and Bengtsson, 2004). Since the dimension of the state vector is typically very high, direct implementation of the covariance recursions is too computationally expensive, and Monte Carlo methods, such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter, have been recently developed in order to reduce the computational burden. An Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) proposed for HYDROS uses a Monte-Carlo ensemble of short-range forecasts to estimate the covariances of the forecast error. Ensemble Kalman Smoothing has been proposed for the re-analysis of HYDROS data, and is expected to yield good estimates of volumetric soil moisture at the surface and sub-surface. Combining the higher resolution active L-band observations with the lower resolution, but more accurate passive observations, will provide information on the spatial distribution of soil moisture. Since these NWP algorithms are currently in development, a matter of great practical concern is the transition from a research and development platform into a operational system. A National Research Council report in the year 2000 describes this process of transitioning from an R&D platform to an operational platform as ""Crossing the Valley of Death"". Array's Scalable GSP technology has been engineered to support the evolution of prototypes into fully functional operational systems, through the use of an infrastructure that supports scalable processing, including the use of the open standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) and a technique of adding new functionality through the use of Generic Signal Processing Blocks (GSPBs). The increasing global impact of severe weather has created a demand for shorter term weather forecasts, and thus for a more efficient processing of satellite data. Also, variability in weather can have a great impact on military operations and tactics, and the growing use of unmanned vehicles requires accurate short term weather forecasts. In order to meet these needs, data from existing satellite systems is now being used in novel ways to produce short term forecasts, or ""nowcasts""where nowcasting is defined as forecasting up to a few hours into the future. For example, 10 minute segments of data from the ESA satellite ERS-2, is now being used to produce near real-time 'nowcasts' of swiftly moving weather systems in the seas around Europe. This new use of ERS-2 data came about in 2004, nearly nine years after the launch of ERS-2. In order to support the re-engineering of satellite ground processing, flexible data ingest and algorithm sequencing capabilities are required. GSPBs allow the signal processing chain to be re-ordered, and the Scalable GSP technology allows the user to configure new data streams and sources. In summary, we will demonstrate how the Scalable Generic Signal Processing architecture is extensible, and provides a unified approach to efficient ground processing of multi-platform Earth observations.","","Algorithms; Computer architecture; Computer software; Data processing; Meteorological radar; Moisture determination; Rapid prototyping; Remote sensing; Satellite ground stations; Signal processing; Weather forecasting; Weather satellites; Carbon cycles; Earth observing systems; Global soil moisture mapping; Satellite ground processing; Soils","","","","","","","","B.

The collection of high-resolution, accurate elevation data in the nearshore zone proved difficult for many organizations. However, the advent of shallow water based LiDAR collection systems, technological improvements in shallow water hydrographic multibeam systems and the ability to collect bathymetry from hyperspectral remotely sensed imagery is changing the face of the coastal mapping community. Through the functionality of ArcGIS Terrains, users of these multisource, multiscale data will be able to seamlessly integrate coastal point data into an efficient storage mechanism. Terrains have the capability to generate small to large scale Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs) on-the-fly. This paper discusses and demonstrates the functionality of this new technology in the context of a coastal mapping project. Topographic LiDAR, multibeam bathymetry, and SHOALS bathymetry LiDAR is incorporated into a geospatial database. Supplementary data, such as breaklines, erosion control devices are added to further assist in accurate model generation at multiple scales. Subsequent modeling at varying resolutions is performed through spatial analysis techniques which further demonstrate the utility of ArcGIS Terrains for shoreline mapping. In a 3D context, visualization techniques are explored using ArcScene and ArcGlobe. This technology has the potential to assist clients in the arena of military applications, pipeline/cable landfall applications, coastal zone management and flood risk modeling. The three main areas that make it difficult for geospatial analysts to work with coastal data are: a) the shear volume of data associated with LiDAR and SoNAR data, b) the variability of resolution requirements (i.e. regional mapping requires decimated data, large scale mapping requires high-resolution), and c) storage and management of varying data sources encompassing the same geography. The paper addresses these areas of concern by explaining the underlying concepts and methodologies that ArcGIS Terrains employ to import, manage, and present these data at varying scales.","","Bathymetry; Data acquisition; Data processing; Mapping; Optical radar; Societies and institutions; Coastal mapping community; Geospatial industry; Hydrographic multibeam systems; Coastal zones","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","MTS/IEEE OCEANS, 2005","","","","","0933957343; 9780933957343","","","English","Proc.

Radiation at this wavelength is not significantly scattered or absorbed by fog, clouds, smoke, or fine dust, which may blind other electro-optic sensors. Additionally, millimeter-wave imagery depends on a phenomenology based on reflection rather than emission, which produces a high level of contrast for metal targets. The system to be flight tested operates in the W-band region of the spectrum at a 30 Hz frame rate.

Key sensor-level HSI system performance requirements dictate the optical, spectrometer, focal plane and data processing design parameters for a given choice of spectral instrument design and platform altitude. A detailed understanding of the performance/sensor design trade-space that is available facilitates informed decision making and planning. We have developed a spreadsheet-based sensitivity analysis tool for dispersive HSI sensors that enables rapid and meaningful investigation of candidate sensor designs over a wide variety of parametric conditions at a level of detail consistent with the first-order specification of the instrument subsystems. Our approach also facilitates: assessment of a fixed sensor design against varied atmospheric/target phenomenology assumptions, determination of sensor design drivers, and sensor design optimization. Our parametric analysis capability is illustrated by synthesizing a relatively detailed HSI dispersive design based on optical aperture diameter of 70 cm and an orbital altitude of 690 km. These two parameters are borrowed from the IKONOS commercial remote sensing system. As part of this synthesis, sensitivity enhancement by back-scanning is analyzed for the purpose of deriving both the maximum sensor contiguous scan length and the associated precision line-of-sight pitch angle rate control requirements.","Back-scanning; Design trades; Dispersive spectrometer; Focal planes; Hyperspectral Imaging; IKONOS; Instrument specifications; MODTRAN","Back-scanning; Design trades; Dispersive spectrometers; Focal planes; Hyperspectral imaging (HSI); IKONOS; Instruments specifications; MODTRAN; Algorithms; Decision making; Dispersion (waves); Military applications; Sensitivity analysis; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrometers; Image sensors","","","","","","","Basedow, Robert W., HYDICE System, implementation and performance, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2480, pp. 258-267, (1995); Blechinger, Fritz, Optical concepts for high resolution imaging spectrometers, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2480, pp. 165-179, (1995); Hackwell, John A., LWIR/MWIR imaging hyperspectral sensor for airborne and ground-based remote sensing, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2819, pp. 102-107, (1996); Lomheim, Terrence S., Translation of spectral radiance levels, band choices, and signal-to-noise requirements to focal plane specifications and design constraints, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 4486, pp. 263-307, (2002); Modtran 4 User S Manual, (1999); undefined, (2012); undefined, (2005); Space Mission Analysis and Design, (1999); Mouroulis, Pantazis Z., Convex grating types for concentric imaging spectrometers, Applied Optics, 37, 31, pp. 7200-7208, (1998); Mouroulis, Pantazis Z., Pushbroom imaging spectrometer with high spectroscopic data fidelity: experimental demonstration, Optical Engineering, 39, 3, pp. 808-816, (2000)","","Shen, S.S.; Lewis, P.E.","","SPIE","Imaging Spectrometry X","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-15844394103"

The VIPR mission planning component will support autonomous operations of Navy unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), including the Fire Scout. A goal of the SBIR project is for VIPR to be used in conjunction with the Navy's Tactical Control System (TCS), which implements technology to control a number of different unmanned aircraft systems. The VIPR component is a Linux-based, data-driven, mission planning and inflight replanning tool. It includes functions for asset allocation, coordinated route planning, and analysis. The technology embodied in VIPR provides the ability to generate multiple vehicle routes that take into account diverse vehicle assignments, target allocations, threat environments, vehicle performance, terrain, stealth, payloads, and combinatorial vehicle synergies that can only be attained using optimization techniques. VIPR-enabled systems will provide the means to autonomously reassess mission environments, reevaluate mission objectives, and generate responsive vehicle retasking and survivable routes to best accomplish the goals of the mission. In this presentation, we will give some background information about the Fire Scout, the TCS, and VIPR, and then discuss some challenges associated with mission planning for the Fire Scout including programmatic challenges and challenges associated with implementation of autonomous operations, using vehicle health and status information for dynamic replanning, and interacting with the TCS.","","Computer operating systems; Control systems; Data processing; Optimization; Project management; Robots; Strategic planning; Unmanned vehicles; Asset allocation; Tactical control system (TCS); Target planning; Versatile integrated plannelr and router (VIPR); Military engineering","","","","","","","","","","Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International","Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, AUVI","AUVSI's Unmanned Systems North America 2004 - Proceedings","","","","","","","","English","AUVSI Unmanned Syst.

The object-oriented approach can contribute to powerful automatic and semi-automatic analysis for most remote sensing applications. Synergetic use to pixel-based or statistical signal processing methods explores the rich information contents. Here, we explain principal strategies of object-oriented analysis, discuss how the combination with fuzzy methods allows implementing expert knowledge and describe a representative example for the proposed workflow from remote sensing imagery to GIS.

To prevent such collisions, we are developing an obstacle detection and warning system for helicopters. An Infrared (IR) camera, a color camera and a Millimeter Wave (MMW) radar are employed as its sensor components. This paper describes the performance of the system. 94GHz FMCW radar has been developed for this system. The Vivaldi antenna has been fabricated for the radar. The range accuracy of the radar is tested by the measurements. The radiation pattern of the Vivaldi antenna is measured in the anechoic chamber. The validity of the IR camera to detect obstacles is evaluated by the flight measurements. IR images, collected by the measurements are employed to analyze the effect of the background brightness and to develop new rendering techniques to enhance obstacles. The results show that the accuracy of the FMCW radar is within 5%. The Vivaldi antenna has good characteristics but its transition circuit deforms the total antenna pattern. It is shown that IR camera greatly increases the possibility to detect obstacles even in poor visibility. The normal distribution in the IR spectrum proves to be enough to analyze the image and to derive the obstacle information. The IR image rendered by the pseudo color method is effective to enhance obstacles.","","Cameras; Charge coupled devices; Collision avoidance; Data processing; Helicopters; Infrared imaging; Military applications; Millimeter waves; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrum analysis; Background brightness; FMCW radar; Obstacle detection; Traingular wave modulator; Vivaldi antenna; Alarm systems","","","","","","","Hogg, G.

These operate in different parts of the infrared spectrum. The special optical and detector technologies used in these different devices are first reviewed. On this basis, a special target plate is constructed with its own internal radiation source that allows all of these devices to be calibrated geometrically. The actual experimental and calibration procedures are described, as is the method used for the automated measurement of all the targets using image matching techniques. The subsequent data processing and analysis are then outlined. The results obtained from the successful calibration of a representative sample of CCD cameras and thermal video frame scanners are presented and discussed in detail. They provide much new and accurate information on the geometric characteristics of these imagers that can be used in military, medical, industrial, and environmental applications. © 2003 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","Focal plane array infrared CCD cameras; Geometric calibration; Image matching; Polynomial transformation; Pyroelectric vidicon cameras; Thermal video frame scanners","Calibration; Charge coupled devices; Geometrical optics; Infrared devices; Mathematical models; Photogrammetry; Polynomials; Pyroelectricity; Remote sensing; Video cameras; Focal plane arrays (FPA); Imaging systems","","","","","","","Amin, Ahmed Mohamed, Design characteristics and geometric calibration of video frame scanners, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 49, 1, pp. 12-24, (1994); Applications of Thermal Imaging, (1988); Photogramm Eng, (1969); Photogramm Eng, (1970); Photogramm Eng, (1973); Wong, Kam W., GEOMETRIC AND CARTOGRAPHIC ACCURACY OF ERTS-1 IMAGERY., Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 41, 5, pp. 621-635, (1975); Geometric and Radiometric Analysis of A Ccd Camera Based Photogrammetric Close Range System, (1992); Int Arch Photogramm Remote Sensing, (1984); International Archives of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, (1986); International Archives of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, (1986)","G.

It shows that data sets can be combined in many ways to satisfy customer requests for operational oceanography products if special care is given to the underlying data architecture and data interface. To accommodate varied product requirements, the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) has adopted a geospatial data interface that contains both a metadata catalog and data transformation features. The geospatial data interface uses the metadata catalog containing spatial reference information to find and retrieve data in a usable, georeferenced format. Geographical Information System (GIS) applications can directly access the catalog through a spatial index maintained by commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) spatial data applications. This same data architecture can be utilized to maintain an object-oriented feature database as well.

Particularly, to enhance a pilot's situational awareness with future 3D Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS), accurate, reliable, and hi-resolution terrain databases are required to offer a realistic and reliable terrain depiction. On the other hand, optimized or reduced terrain models are necessary to ensure real-time rendering and computing performance. In this paper a method for adaptive terrain meshing and depiction for SVS is presented. The initial data set is decomposed by using a wavelet transform. By examining the wavelet coefficients, an adaptive surface approximation for various Level-of-Detail is determined at runtime. Additionally, the dyadic scaling of the wavelet transform is used to build a hierarchical quad-tree representation for the terrain data. This representation enhances fast interactive computations and real-time rendering methods. For the integrated airport navigation function an airport mapping database compliant to the new DO-272 standard is processed and integrated in the realized system. The used airport database contains precise airport vector geometries with additional object attributes as background information. In conjunction these data sets can be used for various airport navigation functions like automatic taxi guidance. Both, the multi-resolution terrain concept and airport navigation function are integrated into a hi-level certifiable 2D/3D scene graph rendering system. It runs on an aviation certifiable embedded rendering graphics board. The optimized combination of multi-resolution terrain, scene graph, and graphics boards allows it to handle dynamically terrain models up to 1 arc second resolution.

Occlusion is the most obvious from of interaction. Here we present a system which uses 3D CAD models in combination with optical and range data to recognize partially occluded objects. Recognition uses a hypothesize, perturb, render, and match cycle to arrive at a scene-optimized prediction of model appearance. This final scene-optimized prediction is based upon an iterative search algorithm converging to the optimal 3D pose of the object. During recognition, evidence of terrain occlusion in range imagery is mapped through the model into the optical imagery in order to explain the absence of model features. A similar process predicts the structure of occluding contours. Highly occluded military vehicles are successfully matched using this approach.","","Algorithms; Computer aided design; Image sensors; Iterative methods; Mathematical models; Object recognition; Optical data processing; Optimization; Localized scene interpretation; Image understanding","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CDA-9422007, IRI-9503366); Army Research Office, ARO; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (DAAH04-93-G-422, DAAH04-95-1-0447)","1 This work was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Image Understanding Program under Grants DAAH04-93-G-422 and DAAH04-95-1-0447, monitored by the U.S. Army Research Office, and the National Science Foundation under Grants CDA-9422007 and IRI-9503366.","Early Visual Learning, (1995); Besl, Paul J., Three-dimensional object recognition, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 17, 1, pp. 75-145, (1985); Local Search Algorithms for Geometric Object Recognition Optimal Correspondence and Pose, (1993); November 1993 Fort Carson Rsta Data Collection Final Report, (1994); Beveridge, James Ross, Demonstrating polynomial run-time growth for local search matching, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 533-538, (1995); Laser Radar ATR Algorithms Phase III Final Report, (1992); Breuel, Thomas M., Fast recognition using adaptive subdivisions of transformation space, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 1992-June, pp. 445-451, (1992); Three Dimensional Object Recognition Systems, (1993); Cass, Todd Anthony, Polynomial-time object recognition in the presence of clutter, occlusion, and uncertainty, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 588 LNCS, pp. 834-842, (1992); Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, (1973)","","","Acad Press Inc","","","","","","10773142","","CVIUF","","English","Comput Vision Image Undersanding","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034321627"

The joint program formed as a result of President Clinton's direction is known as the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). Key to the success of the convergence process are continuing efforts to achieve commonalty in the ground data processing segment across US government organizations, in particular within the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Commerce (DOC).

As of three years ago, seven countries had built and flown free-flying Earth remote sensing satellite systems. Capability will proliferate dramatically in the coming decade, and by 2001 the number of countries owning such systems is projected to be 2.5 times the 1995 level. In 1998–9, the first commercial one metre systems are scheduled to become a reality with the launches of Ikonos-1, OrbView-3, and QuickBird-1. In 1999, the number of spectral bands available in a spaceborne remote sensing instrument is scheduled to increase dramatically with the flight of the first hyperspectral sensor on the New Millennium Program's Earth Orbiter-1. In the smallsat arena, civil and commercial minisat missions are scheduled for 1998 and beyond, including ones from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, and Thailand. In the microwave portion of the spectrum, commercial synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems became a reality with the launch of the Canadian Radarsat in 1995, with significant international proliferation projected through 2007. In this paper, the lessons learned from 1980–1997 will be summarized, and projections for the evolution of the field over the coming decade will be made. One result of the proliferation of Earth remote sensing systems and data is a growing need for improved methods of data processing, interpretation, and archiving. Also needed are trained scientists and engineers who can understand the data and bring an end-to-end systems perspective to the burgeoning field of Earth remote sensing. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

These methods exploit remotely sensed data sets including hyperspectral (HYDICE) imagery, near infrared and thermal infrared (Daedalus 3600), radar, in addition to terrain datasets. Data normalization and sub-pixel image registration are critical to the successful outcome of data fusion of these various types of imagery. While there has been a lot of attention toward potential contributions of hyperspectral imagery, very little has been published on the necessary pre-processing of hyperspectral data in order to extract information from imagery over large areas. This poster focuses on the methods and uncertainties associated with the necessary data processing of the hyperspectral datasets. In particular, the issues associated with mosaicking large numbers of frames of HYDICE data are discussed: first, the radiometric normalization and determination of apparent surface reflectance (atmospheric modeling versus direct calibration with ground reflectance panels), second, image registration (geometric correction), and third, hyperspectral band selection.","","Database systems; Feature extraction; Image sensors; Land use; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sensor data fusion; Hyperspectral band selection; Hyperspectral imagery; Image registration; Surface reflectance; Radar imaging","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS.

The Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (Fleet Numerical) and the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO), are the Navy's central sites for the receipt and processing of satellite data for meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) applications. METOC officers at regional centers, detachments, and afloat also receive and exploit a variety of satellite data. In this paper, we discuss the use of satellite data for oceanographic analysis and prediction. A wide variety of satellite-borne sensors are exploited, including foreign/civilian, visible/infrared/microwave, and passive/ active. Products from these sensors cover horizontal spatial scales, ranging from global (e.g., sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) to local (e.g., near-shore bottom features from Landsat Thematic Mapper); encompass the vertical spatial range of sea surface, water column, and bottom features (e.g., altimetry-derived products); and characterize temporal scales, ranging from seasonal (e.g., optical climatologies from Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) imagery) to real time (e.g., ocean surface winds from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I)). We provide an overview of the sensors utilized, ground segment processing flows, products generated, and the oceanographic applications supported by satellite remote sensing at the Navy's central sites and on scene.","","Algorithms; Data processing; Military operations; Military satellites; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sensors; Advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRR); Satellite borne sensors; Oceanography; AVHRR; CZCS; Landsat TM; naval oceanography; oceanography; satellite sensing; SSM/I; US Navy","","","","","","","Mts 94 Proceedings Challenges and Opportunities in the Marine Environment, (1994); Bull Amer Meteor Soc, (1994); Coulter, Robert E., Ice edge detection and ice/water classification utilizing the ERS-1 and TOPEX altimeters, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2, pp. 1234-1236, (1994); Dailey, Charles H., Flexible environmental products and services to support naval operations, Marine Technology Society Journal, 31, 1, pp. 49-53, (1997); Franklin, Steven E., An example of satellite multisensor data fusion, Computers and Geosciences, 19, 4, pp. 577-583, (1993); User S Guide for the Naval Satellite Image Processing System, (1995); Noaa Polar Orbiter Data User S Guide, (1998); Lagerloef, Gary S.E., Empirical orthogonal function analysis of advanced very high resolution radiometer surface temperature patterns in Santa Barbara Channel, Journal of Geophysical Research, 93, C6, pp. 6863-6873, (1988); Lillesand, Thomas M., Remote sensing and image interpretation., Remote sensing and image interpretation., (1979); Mts 94 Proceedings Challenges and Opportunities in the Marine Environmentt, (1994)","","","","","","","","","00253324","","","","English","Mar.

The generic procedure for obtaining a depth from an airborne lidar pulse involves measurement of the time between the surface return and the bottom return. In practice, because both of these return times are biased due to a number of environmental and hardware effects, it is necessary to apply various correctors in order to obtain depth estimates which are sufficiently accurate to meet International Hydrographic Office standards. Potential false targets, also of both environmental and hardware origin, must be discriminated, and wave heights must be removed. It is important to have a depth confidence value matched to accuracy and to have warnings about or automatic deletion of pulses with questionable characteristics.

The present experiment examined the influence of operational factors on the perceived structure of real-world scenes viewed during low-altitude flight. Multidimensional scaling analyses with stimuli consisting of videotape segments of low-altitude flight over a variety of real-world terrains revealed differences in perceived environmental structure for pilots assigned to different types of jet-fighter aircraft. These results provide evidence that perceptual learning evolves differently under different operational conditions and suggests that training programs should be designed to reflect those differences.

These modules represent the military specific components of the system. The TSI calculates a so called threat map based upon a list of tactical elements such as SAMs, fighters etc. and respective threat models. Besides this it yields some decision aiding functions such as distance to threat calculations in order to transform sensor data into an intuitive format with respect to the human information processing capabilities of the crew. The LAP calculates a low altitude trajectory through the operation area based upon digital terrain data and the TSI's threat map. The data are visualized in a 2D map display.

Decision aids on fire support platforms can assist in route planning, site selection, and develop mobility overlays to enable the shooter to rapidly move into position and prepare for the fire mission. The Decision Aid system utilizes an integrated design approach which has each module interacting with the others by sharing data bases and common algorithms to provide recommended courses of action for route planning and generation, position selection, self defense, logistics estimates, situational awareness and fire mission planning aids such as tactical assessment, tactical planning, sustainment, etc. The Decision Aid system will use expert system artificial intelligence which will be developed from knowledge bases utilizing object oriented design. The modules currently reason on Defense Mapping Agency Interim Terrain Data and Digital Terrain Elevation Data and collect mission, intelligence, and sensor data from the digitized battlefield information distribution system to provide the crew or mission planners with intelligent recommendations. The system can provide a trade off analysis of time vs. safety, enable commanders to rapidly respond to fire support request, automatically generate OpOrders, and create overlays which depict mobility corridors, NBC areas, friendly units, overhead concealment, communications, and threat areas. The Decision Aids system can provide a vastly improved mobility, situational awareness, and decision cycle capabilities which can be utilized to increase the tempo of battle.","","Digital battlefields; Digital Terrain Evaluation Data; Algorithms; Control systems; Data processing; Decision support systems; Intelligent structures; Maps; Strategic planning; Military engineering","","","","","","","","","Suresh, Raja; Langford, William","","SPIE - Int Soc for Opt Engineering, Bellingham, WA USA","Digitization of the Battlefield","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029727257"

This system is expected to fuse data from: (a) attributed measurement oriented sensors (ESM, IFF, etc.); (b) imaging sensors (FLIR, SAR, etc.); (c) tracking sensors (radar, acoustics, etc.); (d) data from remote platforms (data links); and (e) non-sensor data (intelligence reports, environmental data, visual sightings, encyclopedic data, etc.). Based on purely theoretical considerations a central-level fusion architecture will lead to a higher performance fusion system. However, there are a number of systems and fusion architecture issues involving fusion of such dissimilar data: (1) the currently existing sensors are not designed to provide the type of data required by a fusion system; (2) the different types (attribute, imaging, tracking, etc.) of data may require different degree of processing, before they can be used within a fusion system efficiently; (3) the data quality from different sensors, and more importantly from remote platforms via the data links must be taken into account before fusing; and (4) the non-sensor data may impose specific requirements on the fusion architecture (e.g. variable weight/priority for the data from different sensors). This paper presents the analyses performed for the selection of the fusion architecture for the enhanced sensor suite planned for the CP-140 aircraft in the context of the mission requirements and environmental conditions.","","CP-140 aircraft; Feasibility studies; Multi sensor data fusion; Aircraft; Image processing; Military engineering; Performance; Remote sensing; Sensors; Data processing","","","","","","","","","","","SPIE","Signal and Data Processing of Small Targets 1995","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029520468"

The FEIR is a natural instrument from which to build a chemical sensor since most chemical vapors of interest are spectrally active within its operating wavelength range, it is widely distributed in the battlefield, and it is becoming a standard surveillance tool in police departments. Additionally, the output image provides a 2D concentration map of the cloud which is easily interpreted by a lightly trained operator. A system has been designed to provide the spectral sensitivity in a dedicated instrument or to place a chemical detection capability as an adjunct function in a military thermal imager. In the latter case an additional detector array which is spectrally filtered at the focal plane is added to the imager. Real-time autonomous detection and alarm is a military requirement and is desired for commercial use. A detection system model based on a Gaussian vapor concentration distribution has been the basis for detection algorithms. Image processing and analysis methods have been based upon information theory. These techniques extract the cloud image from a clutter scene and perform a limited vapor classification. These methods are suited to hyperspectral imagery. © 1995 SPIE.

The unique capability of an AOTF system to simultaneously acquire two orthogonally poiarized images allows both spectral and polarimetric characterizafion of ground features. The AOTF sensor used in the experiment operated over a wavelength range from 0.5 1 to 0.77 microns, collecting two differently polarized images for each of 33 bands. The experiment data images selected for analysis contain camouflaged military equipment deployed in a desert background. The Spectral Image Processing System (SIPS) software package was used for data correction and spectral analysis. Processing the AOTF data required geometric correction in addition to removing the solar and atmospheric effects. Two methods of spectral analysis are addressed in this research. The first method assesses the spectral analysis accomplished using the Spectral Angle Mapper utility in SIPS. The other method illustrates the spectral information gained through band ratioing a combination of carefully selected bands which highlights a particular target within a scene. Comparison of images created by the difference between polarizations for each band provides the basis for polarimetric analysis of the data. Finally, an algorithm developed to combine the information provided by spectral and polarimetric analysis shows how features within a scene can be distinguished from the background. Results show that AOTF hyperspectral technology has potential to enhance current military intelligence collection capability. © 1994 SPIE.

This requires to develop surface to air defense systems with higher performance in term of surveillance, detection, reaction time and survivability. One way to contribute fulfilling those requirements is combined data processing of data issued from several and also heterogeneous sensors. The design of such combined data processing leads: to analyze the operational use of the sensors (radars, infrared surveillance sensors, ESM, ELINT, COMINT,...), to define operational configurations, to define system and sub-system architecture, to define the data processing itself which is dedicated to perform three basis functions (data fusion, sensor management, man machine interface handling). Today THOMSON-CSF/SDC has already realized and delivered several systems (mainly Air Command and Control systems) implementing multiradar data fusion techniques. Among the two basic data fusion techniques: track fusion (MTS: Multiple Track Selection) and plot fusion (MPVU: Multiple Plot Variable Update), which offers higher level of performance is the one being integrated in recent and future THOMSON-CSF/SDC's systems. Today all domains of activities (Air Command and Control System, Air Traffic Control, Battlefield and Naval Combat Systems) benefit from these techniques. Two typical applications are presented hereafter: fusion of radars and EW sensors in an Air Command and Control System, fusion of radars and infrared sensors in a Battlefield Detection System.","","Command and control systems; Image sensors; Military applications; Multispectral scanners; Radar systems; Radar tracking; Remote sensing; Sensor data fusion; Battlefield detection system; Multiple track selection; Multiradar data fusion techniques; Surveillance radar","","","","","","","","","","Publ by Gauthier-Villars","","","","","","","","RTTCB","","English","Rev Tech Thomson CSF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027664799"

Initial flight test results indicate that the integrated navigation system showed good performance, even when the performance of the individual sensors was deteriorated.","","Data processing; Global positioning system; Military engineering; National aerospace laboratory; Terrain reference navigation; Inertial navigation systems","","","","","","","","","","Publ by IEEE","IEEE Aerospace & Electronic Systems Soc","IEEE 1992 Position Location and Navigation Symposium - PLANS '92","","","","","9780780314368; 9781424415373; 9781479933204; 0780394542; 0780304683; 9781467303866; 0780314360; 9780780394544; 1424415373; 9781424450367","RPLSD","","English","Rec IEEE PLANS Position Locat Navig Symp","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026840480"

The key problems are the differences of orbit selection and operation mode of the space-crafts carrying the sensors. For a given function the high efficiency/cost ratio of the standard sensor system can be obtained by checking production size and reducing development work to a minimum. The paper described the main points of design and design analysis for three kinds of multifunctional sensors, containing several telescope design approaches, focusing plane design, scanning system design, data processing system design, operating orbit or covering ground area and operating method. The new sensor system has reached the required performance indexes and meets the requirements of several tacsats.","","Satellites--Defense Applications; Multifunctional Sensors; Tacsats; Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10018891","","HONGE","","Chinese","Hongwai","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026818032"

This paper describes the use of a predator-prey neural network paradigm for path analysis. A proof-of-concept simulation is developed and successfully utilized to map optimal/near-optimal paths from given starting points to given destinations through a field of obstacles. The worst-case computational complexity for this algorithm, when implemented on a parallel architecture, is in order of O(n), where n is equal to the number of nodes in the network. Serial implementations are in order of O(n1.5). This is noteworthy because fast and reasonable solutions to complex problems are often preferable to an ideal optimal solution that typically requires specialized hardware and/or too much time and money to generate. Potential applications for this model include trafficability analysis and route prediction. This model could also serve as a pre-search tool to set search bounds for heuristic search algorithms such as A*.

The missions include environmental sensing, land and ocean remote sensing, tactical missile tracking, and space object surveillance. The key is that while the spacecraft is a standard configuration for all missions, its design is a compromise between the specific requirements for each mission; the orbit chosen and operations mode for each mission also vary. Although sub-optimal for any given mission, standard sensor systems have the advantage of achieving a higher benefit-to-cost ratio by realizing economies of scale in production and reduced development. Point designs of three different multi-mission sensors are presented, supported by design analysis, and encompassing several approaches to telescope design, focal plane design, scanning system design, data processing system design, and orbits/coverage and operations. The resulting sensor system designs are highly capable, compared to existing systems, meet the performance goals established, and yet fit within the tactical satellite class.","","Optical Systems - Space Applications; Remote Sensing - Equipment; Sensors - Space Applications; Space Research - Surveillance; Spacecraft - Military Applications; Electrooptical Sensors; Environmental Monitoring; Ocean Remote Sensing; Space-Borne Multi-Mission Sensors; Surveillance Missions; Tactical Military Needs; Electrooptical devices","","","","","","","","","","Publ by Int Soc for Optical Engineering","SPIE","Infrared Technology XVI","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025537211"

Today, efforts are being concentrated on more sophisticated techniques of remote sensing and computerized data processing. While these technical advances are both desirous and fascinating, let us not forget that remote sensing as a perfected tool of observation, analysis, and classification is nothing unless the user has a firm knowledge of the phenomena under investigation and an unequivocably expressed problematic to resolve. The researcher needs to marry intuition, imagination, and memory with concise logic and rigorous method. Any further training or education in remote sensing must be inspired by a symbiosis of empirical and rational knowledge. Furthermore, it will increasingly necessitate the integration of data from several sources, presumably in a ‘user friendly’ environment. Such an environment will free the researcher to concentrate more on problem-solving strategies. Eventually, a broader, more flexible educational structure will allow a branching-out to meet the needs of different potential clients. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","education; remote sensing; technical advance","","","","","","","Report of the Image Analysis System Users Working Group, (1986); Introduction A I Etude De La Medecine Experimentale, (1966); Teledetection Et Cooperation Frangaise Journees Internationales Sur La Formation Des Utilisateurs De La Teledetection, (1984); Casasent, David P., PATTERN RECOGNITION: A REVIEW., IEEE Spectrum, 18, 3, pp. 28-33, (1981); Catlow, D.

C R, HRL Laboratories, Malibu, CA, United States","One of the more complex processing problems facing both the military and commercial world is that of image analysis and understanding. The range of applications in which a real time computer vision system could have impact is extraordinarily large. In the military arena the need and potential benefits of a real time capability for target acquisition, autonomous guidance and image interpretation are well recognized and understood. To this end the Department of Defense is currently supporting several projects such as the DARPA Image Understanding (I.U.) Program to analyze both the processing requirements and machine organization for complex image processing and analysis. Truly autonomous systems which can perform both the imaging and processing in real-time using inexpensive and compact hardware will have significant impact in the tactical scenario for applications requiring remote sensing and analysis. (The term 'smart-sensors' has been introduced for hardware which performs both the sensing and processing in a single substrate.) In addition, an equally important impact might be made in areas such as automated production and inspection for machine assembly, etc. These two general areas are in many ways analogous and much of the hardware and software developed can be applied to both problems. Significant differences do, however, exist in terms of the signal to noise specification of the images, the required response time of the machinery, and the system constraints such as machine size and cost. © 1980 by AFIPS Press.","","Military data processing; Autonomous guidance; Complex processing; Computer vision system; Image analyze; Image-analysis; Potential benefits; Processing problems; Real time capability; Real-time computer vision; Target acquisition; Military photography","","","","","Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA, (3119); Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA","This work is supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense and was monitored by the Wright Patterson Air Force Base under Contract F-33615-76-C-1203, ARPA Order No. 3119.","Unger, Stephen H., A Computer Oriented Toward Spatial Problems, Proceedings of the IRE, 46, 10, pp. 1744-1750, (1958); McCormick, Bruce H., The Illinois Pattern Recognition Computer–ILLIAC III, IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers, EC-12, 6, pp. 791-813, (1963); Gray, Stephen B., Local Properties of Binary Images in Two Dimensions, IEEE Transactions on Computers, C-20, 5, pp. 551-561, (1971); Preston, Kendall, Feature Extraction by Golay Hexagonal Pattern Transforms, IEEE Transactions on Computers, C-20, 9, pp. 1007-1014, (1971); Kruse, Björn, A Parallel Picture Processing Machine, IEEE Transactions on Computers, C-22, 12, pp. 1075-1087, (1973); Proc 3rd Ijcpr, (1976); Mori, Kenichi, DESIGN OF LOCAL PARALLEL PATTERN PROCESSOR FOR IMAGE PROCESSING., AFIPS Natl Comput Conf Expo Conf Proc, 47, pp. 1025-1031, (1978); Barnes, George H., The ILLIAC IV Computer, IEEE Transactions on Computers, C-17, 8, pp. 746-757, (1968); Potter, J.

A Ground Processing Facility that accepts the sensor data and provides the necessary functions for a human interpreter to exploit the imagery and generate target reports almost in real time is achievable. Some basic functional elements that would aid the image interpreter are a feature extractor to screen the incoming imagery and display only annotate target related imagery and an automated report generation and dissemination technique. The critical factor in defining the performance requirements for elements of the Ground Processing Facility is that each element must improve the speed and accuracy of the total exploitation process.
