Traditional approaches often fail to integrate heterogeneous data, limiting predictive and decision-support capabilities. This study presents a conceptual architecture for an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted Digital Twin (DT) of the Centre-Val de Loire region, designed to unify time-dependent multi-source data. Based on the ENVRI Reference Model, it covers Science, Information, Computational, Engineering, and Technology layers, defining standardized data exchange, communication protocols, and prototype functionalities. A proof of concept FIWARE implementation supports ingestion, monitoring and analytical services for piezometric and meteorological data, exemplified through groundwater dynamics in the Beauce aquifer. It integrates daily observations from 53 piezometric stations over more than five years, managing approximately 2.8 million records in a containerized environment. Results show that the proposed DT architecture can enhance sustainability-oriented decision making, integrating heterogeneous data and predictive analyses while enabling collaboration across scientific and technical domains. Its modular design offers a replicable template for future AI-assisted environmental DTs, scalable to larger regions. Hence, this work illustrates how DTs can improve environmental monitoring and understanding, providing a pathway toward resilient, data-driven management of natural resources. © 2026 The Authors.","Artificial intelligence; Data architecture; Digital twins; Environmental monitoring; Natural resource management","artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; data management; decision making; environmental monitoring; resource management; Beauce [Centre]; Centre-Val de Loire; France","","","","","Conseil Régional du Centre-Val de Loire","Funding text 1: This work has received support under the JUNON Program, with the financial support of the R\u00E9gion Centre-Val de Loire (France) .; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge TU Wien Bibliothek, Austria for financial support through its Open Access Funding Programme.

For engine manufacturers, understanding emission compliance risks early is crucial for technology selection, calibration strategies, and validation routines. This study focuses on developing analytical and statistical methods for emission compliance risk assessment using Fleet Intelligence Data, which includes high-frequency telematics data from over 500K machines, reporting more than 1000 measures at 1Hz frequency. Traditional analytical methods are inadequate for handling such big data, necessitating advanced methods. We developed data pipelines to query measures from the Enterprise Data Lake (A Structured Data storage system), address big data challenges, and ensure data quality. Regulatory requirements were translated into software logic and applied to pre-processed data for emission compliance assessment. The resulting reports provide actionable insights on NOx sensor activity, engine warmup operations, high-risk drive cycles, and load profiles across different operation regimes. This approach significantly reduces the reliance on costly and labor-intensive physical testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) by integrating advanced analytical methods into the workflow. By leveraging high-frequency telematics data, this method enables engineers to identify failed machines in the field more efficiently. It also provides valuable insights and reasoning behind these failures, facilitating quicker and more informed decision-making. This not only enhances emission compliance monitoring but also optimizes resource allocation and reduces overall regulatory risks. In summary, the developed methods enable effective emission compliance monitoring, reduce regulatory risks, and help optimize calibration strategies by understanding customer usage patterns. These methods are scalable for various emission regulations. © 2025 SAE International and SAEINDIA.","","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Calibration; Data reduction; Decision making; Digital storage; Engines; Fleet operations; Analytical method; Compliance monitoring; Compliance regulations; Emission compliance; Emission standard; Engine manufacturers; High frequency HF; Regulatory risks; Risks assessments; Telematics; Regulatory compliance","","","","","","","undefined, (2020); undefined, (2022); Arxiv 2503 05648v1, (2025); Singh, Mukul, Deep Learning Model Based CO2 Emissions Prediction Using Vehicle Telematics Sensors Data, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, 8, 1, pp. 768-777, (2023); Li, Yong, Running-In Performance Analysis Based on Telematics Data, SAE Technical Papers, October, (2019); undefined, (2024)","","","SAE International","CATERPILLAR; Cummins; John Deere; Mahindra; SANY","Off-Highway Technical Conference 2025, OFFT 2025","2025-11-06 through 2025-11-07","Pune","216903","01487191","9780768014778; 0768014778; 9780768013191; 0768013194","","","English","SAE Techni.

This paper describes the AI–Big Data Analytics Architecture based on a data lake architecture that uses a reduced and customized set of Hadoop and Spark as a cost-effective, on-premises alternative for advanced data analytics in power systems. As a case study, a comparative analysis of electricity price forecasting models in the day-ahead market for nodes of the Mexican national electrical system using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models, is presented. To build and select the best forecasting model, a data science and machine learning methodology is used. The results show that the Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression models presented the best performance, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) between 1% and 4% for five-day-ahead electricity price forecasting. The implementation of the best forecasting model into the Big Data Analytics Platform allows the automation of the calculation of the local electricity price forecast per node (every 24, 72, or 120 h) and its display in a comparative dashboard with actual and forecasted data for decision-making on demand. The proposed architecture is a valuable tool that allows the future implementation of intelligent energy forecasting models in power grids, such as load demand, fuel prices, power generation, and consumption, among others. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; big data analytics; big data architecture; data lake; electricity price; energy forecasting; machine learning; power systems","Advanced Analytics; Architecture; Big data; Computer architecture; Consumer behavior; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Data Analytics; Data reduction; Decision making; Deep learning; Electric load forecasting; Energy policy; Power markets; Big data analytic; Big data architecture; Data analytics; Data architectures; Data lake; Electricity prices; Energy forecasting; Machine-learning; Power; Power system; Learning systems","","","","","","","Liao, Huilian, Review of Big Data Analytics for Smart Electrical Energy Systems, Energies, 16, 8, (2023); Int J Comb Optim Probl Inform, (2024); Wang, Yi, Review of Smart Meter Data Analytics: Applications, Methodologies, and Challenges, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 10, 3, pp. 3125-3148, (2019); Zhou, Kaile, Big data driven smart energy management: From big data to big insights, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 56, pp. 215-225, (2016); Jiang, Hui, Energy big data: A survey, IEEE Access, 4, pp. 3844-3861, (2016); Guerrero-Prado, Jenniffer Sidney, The power of big data and data analytics for AMI data: A case study, Sensors (Switzerland), 20, 11, pp. 1-27, (2020); Zhang, Yang, Big data analytics in smart grids: a review, Energy Informatics, 1, 1, (2018); Kezunovic, Mladen, Big data analytics for future electricity grids, Electric Power Systems Research, 189, (2020); Syed, Dabeeruddin, Smart Grid Big Data Analytics: Survey of Technologies, Techniques, and Applications, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 59564-59585, (2021); Escobedo, Guillermo, Big data & analytics to support the renewable energy integration of smart grids case study: Power solar generation, IoTBDS 2017 - Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security, pp. 267-275, (2017)","G.

Managing this data is critical for mitigating disruptive and costly events such as mechanical failures and flight delays. This paper presents a comprehensive application of predictive analytics and machine learning to enhance aviation safety and operational efficiency. We address two core challenges: predictive maintenance of aircraft engines and forecasting flight delays. For maintenance, we utilise NASA’s C-MAPSS simulation dataset to develop and compare models, including one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), for classifying engine health status and predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), achieving classification accuracy up to 97%. For operational efficiency, we analyse historical flight data to build regression models for predicting departure delays, identifying key contributing factors such as airline, origin airport, and scheduled time. Our methodology highlights the critical role of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature selection, and data preprocessing in managing high-volume, heterogeneous data sources. The results demonstrate the significant potential of integrating these predictive models into aviation Business Intelligence (BI) systems to transition from reactive to proactive decision-making. The study concludes by discussing the integration challenges within existing data architectures and the future potential of these approaches for optimising complex, networked transportation systems. © 2025 by the authors.","aviation safety; big data; business intelligence (BI); C-MAPSS; dynamic systems; flight delay prediction; machine learning; predictive maintenance; remaining useful life (RUL)","Air traffic control; Air transportation; Aircraft engines; Civil aviation; Complex networks; Data accuracy; Data integration; Decision making; Engines; Fighter aircraft; Fleet operations; Learning systems; Machine learning; NASA; Neural networks; One dimensional; Prediction models; Predictive analytics; Predictive maintenance; Regression analysis; Aviation safety; Business intelligence; Business-intelligence; C-MAPSS; Flight delays; Flight delays predictions; Machine-learning; Remaining useful life; Remaining useful lives; Big data","","","","","","","Journal of Airline and Airport Management, (2021); What is 3vs Volume Variety and Velocity; AI Meets Bi, (2020); undefined; Larsen, Tulinda, Cross-platform aviation analytics using big-data methods, Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference, ICNS, (2013); Noviantoro, Tri, Investigating airline passenger satisfaction: Data mining method, Research in Transportation Business and Management, 43, (2022); Shiwakoti, Nirajan, Passengers’ Perceptions and Satisfaction with Digital Technology Adopted by Airlines during COVID-19 Pandemic, Future Transportation, 2, 4, pp. 988-1009, (2022); Kang, Ziqiu, Remaining useful life (Rul) prediction of equipment in production lines using artificial neural networks, Sensors (Switzerland), 21, 3, pp. 1-20, (2021); Truong, Dothang, Applications of business analytics in predicting flight on-time performance in a complex and dynamic system, Transportation Journal, 57, 1, pp. 24-52, (2018); Sangupamba, Odette Mwilu, Business intelligence and big data in the cloud: Opportunities for design-science researchers, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 8823, pp. 75-84, (2014)","N.

The driving mechanism of the platform for tool development was clarified. A data governance system for exploration and production based on the platform tool was established，and the supporting role of the governance tool for the system was analyzed. By taking the data quality tool as an example，its architecture，technical implementation，and the“point，line，and surface”three-level quality control model were revealed. Finally，case applications and their effects in representative scenarios such as real-time drilling monitoring，reserve assessment and guarantee，and production plan optimization were introduced. The results show that the data lake platform of CNOOC for exploration and production possesses core features such as unified metadata management， multi-mode storage， batch-stream integrated computing， and service-oriented integration，and it has the capability to manage data volumes of hundreds of millions. The application of the comprehensive governance toolset throughout the entire lifecycle enables the efficient resolution and enhancement of issues related to data asset value， core business decisions， and safety production. The effective integration of the lakehouse architecture with an entire lifecycle data governance system has not only enabled efficient management and continuous quality improvement of massive heterogeneous exploration and production data but also provided a solid data foundation for intelligent business decision-making and lean production operations. This research provides a complete practical model for the intelligent and platform-based production of data governance in oil and gas enterprises and enables empowerment for core business decisions such as exploration and production，as well as safety production. © 2025 Editorial Board of China Offshore Oil and Gas.

However, these repositories often suffer from issues such as incomplete, inconsistent, and low-quality data, which hinder data-driven insights. Existing methods for data imputation, including statistical techniques and machine learning approaches, often rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data and domain-specific knowledge, making them labor-intensive and limited in handling semantic heterogeneity across data formats. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for data imputation that effectively combines the strengths of retrieval mechanisms and large language models (LLMs). This approach constructs semantic-based indexes for heterogeneous data, employs a recall and re-ranking strategy to enhance retrieval relevance, and proposes a method to reduce inference cost while ensuring imputation quality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms machine learning and deep learning approaches. © 2025 by the authors.","data imputation; data mining; retrieval-augmented generation","Data handling; Deep learning; Digital storage; Information retrieval; Labeled data; Learning systems; Semantics; Centralised; Data driven; Data imputation; Decisions makings; Large amounts; Low qualities; Machine learning approaches; Quality data; Retrieval-augmented generation; Statistical techniques; Data mining","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKPs, (2024YFE0209000); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKPs; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (U23B2019); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC","Xiaojun SHI is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2024YFE0209000), the NSFC (Grant No. U23B2019).","Blazquez, Desamparados, Big Data sources and methods for social and economic analyses, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 130, pp. 99-113, (2018); Can, Umit, Big social network data and sustainable economic development, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 11, (2017); Arora, Anudeep, Data-Driven Decision Support Systems in E-Governance: Leveraging AI for Policymaking, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 844, pp. 229-243, (2024); Linkov, Igor I., Governance strategies for a sustainable digital world, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 2, (2018); van Veenstra, Anne Fleur, Data-driven policy making: The policy lab approach, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 10429 LNCS, pp. 100-111, (2017); Rendle, Steffen, Factorization machines, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, pp. 995-1000, (2010); He, Xiangnan, Neural factorization machines for sparse predictive analytics, SIGIR 2017 - Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 355-364, (2017); Arxiv, (2023); Wang, Liping, Stage-Aware Hierarchical Attentive Relational Network for Diagnosis Prediction, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 36, 4, pp. 1773-1784, (2024); Ye, Muchao, MedPath: Augmenting health risk prediction via medical knowledge paths, The Web Conference 2021 - Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2021, pp. 1397-1409, (2021)","L.

However, a modern data platform that is portable, resilient, and efficient is required to manage organisations’ data and support their growth. Furthermore, the change in the data management architectures has been accompanied by changes in storage formats, particularly open standard formats like Apache Hudi, Apache Iceberg, and Delta Lake. With many alternatives, organisations are unclear on how to combine these into an effective platform. Our work investigates capabilities provided by Kubernetes and other Cloud-Native software, using DataOps methodologies to build a generic data platform that follows the Data Lakehouse architecture. We define the data platform specification, architecture, and core components to build a proof of concept system. Moreover, we provide a clear implementation methodology by developing the core of the proposed platform, which are infrastructure (Kubernetes), ingestion and transport (Argo Workflows), storage (MinIO), and finally, query and processing (Dremio). We then conducted performance benchmarks using an industry-standard benchmark suite to compare cold/warm start scenarios and assess Dremio’s caching capabilities, demonstrating a 12% median enhancement of query duration with caching. © The Author(s) 2025.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Cloud-Native; Data Lakehouse; DataOps; Kubernetes","Big data; Information management; Sea ice; Storage management; Cloud-native; Competitive edges; Data driven decision; Data lakehouse; Data management architecture; Data platform; Dataops; Decisions makings; Kubernetes; Storage formats; Decision making","","","","","","","Armbrust, Michael, Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics, 11th Annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, CIDR 2021, (2021); Barata, Melyssa, An overview of decision support benchmarks: TPC-DS, TPC-H and SSB, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 353, pp. 619-628, (2015); Barron-Lugo, Juan Armando, Xel: A cloud-agnostic data platform for the design-driven building of high-availability data science services, Future Generation Computer Systems, 145, pp. 87-103, (2023); Boch, Michael, A Systematic Review of Data Management Platforms, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 469 LNNS, pp. 15-24, (2022); Emerging Architectures for Modern Data Infrastructure, (2020); C4 Model for Visualising Software Architecture, (2018); Cisco Systems Inc 2019, (2019); Clarke, Roger A., Big data, big risks, Information Systems Journal, 26, 1, pp. 77-90, (2016); Cloud Native Computing Foundation 2021, (2023); Data on the Daily Subnational 14 Day Notification Rate of New Covid 19 Cases European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Ecdc, (2022)","A.

It embodies a genuine catalyst for economic and strategic advantages, distinguishing industry leaders from the rest. Prominent organizations recognize the importance of not just amassing data from diverse sources but also harnessing the transformative power of data analytics for informed determination processes. Within this setting, the data lake solution stands as a robust framework handling vast data sources and enabling data investigations to support decision-making tasks. This paper delves into the realm of intelligent data lake management systems designed to overcome the limitations of traditional business intelligence, which struggles to meet the demands of data-driven decision-making. Data lakes excel in the analysis of data from myriad sources, particularly when data cleaning becomes a time-consuming endeavor. Still, managing diverse datasets devoid of a predefined data structure presents a significant challenge, potentially leading to a data lake devolving into a data swamp. Within this article, we adopt the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to oversee the data lake environment’s handling, processing, analysis, and display of huge datasets. To evaluate the efficacy of our suggested approach, we conducted comprehensive assessments using the topic coherence metric. Our experiments yielded results indicating the superior accuracy of our approach when applied to the tested datasets. © The Author(s) 2024.","big data; data analytics; data lake management; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; topic modeling","","","","","","","","Alnoukari, Mouhib, From business intelligence to big data: The power of analytics, Integration Challenges for Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Data Mining, pp. 44-62, (2020); International Journal of Computer Applications Technology and Research, (2017); Huang, Shih Chia, Big Data Analytics and Business Intelligence in Industry, Information Systems Frontiers, 19, 6, pp. 1229-1232, (2017); Olawoyin, Anifat M., Open Data Lake to Support Machine Learning on Arctic Big Data, Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2021, pp. 5215-5224, (2021); Cherradi, Mohamed, DLDB-Service: An Extensible Data Lake System, Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies, 147, pp. 211-220, (2023); Rajapaksha, Minuri D.W., Semantic Information Retrieval based on Topic Modeling and Community Interests Mining, MERCon 2019 - Proceedings, 5th International Multidisciplinary Moratuwa Engineering Research Conference, pp. 60-65, (2019); Ijcem International Journal of Computational Engineering Management, (2018); Itm Web Conf, (2018); Terrizzano, Ignacio G., Data wrangling: The challenging journey from the wild to the lake, CIDR 2015 - 7th Biennial Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, (2015); Security Data Lake, (2015)","M.

This requires decision making backed by mammoth amounts of data from various data sources to be utilized in compute heavy and scientifically advanced applications. This has led to a new era of data management that breaks barriers of data silos, is standardized and technology agnostic enabling fluidity, collaboration and cost effectiveness with highly agile governance. This paper demonstrates the transformation of a large E&P operator to the Open Subsurface Data universe backed by Halliburton's development on industry's first hybrid cloud designed to deploy, integrate, and manage sophisticated E&P cloud applications to the OSDU™ data platform to provide interoperability between applications to enhance the new innovations and development. The approach to this Operator's transformation was based on Halliburton-Landmark's end-to-end workflow and seamless dataflow and application integration across the domain on OSDU™ unified data platform testing and establishing workflows in all key compute heavy stages and E&P-Seismic processing, interpretation, well planning, well construction and advanced AI/ML algorithms. The OSDU™ Data platform is hosted on the operator's cloud instance which needs to be connected to all vendor agnostic applications. Halliburton deployed an iEnergy cloud instance and set up an open architecture platform as an in-formation foundation that connects to the Operator's OSDU™ data platform through OSDU™ API calls creating a virtual data lake without data replication. This open architecture platform connects the operator's data to all applications hosted on the cloud and even enabling data transfer between the applications for increased collaboration. Various E&P workflows from subsurface data processing to drilling workflows were tested and performance, connectivity and cost optimization was measured. This transformation in data management enabled running big data processing jobs and generate multiple scenarios to help create accurate, integrated, and reliable subsurface models and make better decisions. This transformation in data management, OSDU™ standard adoption and cloud migration lead to: 1. Building more models in less time with unmatched speed, drastically reducing the typical earth modeling workflow time 2. Handle large quantities of data by leveraging elastic cloud computing to quickly calculate and quantify accurate, reliable oil and gas reserves 3. Access one integrated, up-to-date model to use and collaborate with other disciplines across the enterprise, improving workforce efficiency and effectiveness. 4. Make better well placement decisions and production forecasting with the aid of more trusted reserves calculations. The success of this deployment serves as a model to unlocking the benefits of standardized data management and adoption of cloud. This study also sheds light on not just how operators should envision their journey to OSDU™ but also how E&P service providers can transform their solutions (applications, services, management) to be OSDU™ compliant. Halliburton has been an active and contributing member of the OSDU™ Community ensuring the applications in their portfolio are OSDU™ compatible including a breadth of cloud-native applications, intelligent AI/ML based applications, and workflows for data scientists to build new models run on top of OSDU™. The success of OSDU™ depends on identifying the right data strategy and highlighting the right workflow that will have an impact on the business. This paper demonstrates the planning, execution and results of the same.

The integration and harmonization of geospatial data from heterogeneous sources represents a significant challenge in the context of the implementation of the INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe) Directive. The need for stan-dardization of geospatial data, both on a global scale and in the context of the INSPIRE Directive, is primarily driven by the need for interoperability, integration and efficient analysis of spatial information from different systems, formats and semantic structures. In this paper we propose a comprehensive and extensible architecture for the automatic transformation and harmonization of heterogeneous spatial data into INSPIRE-compliant formats, that ensures interoperability within the European infrastructure.

One of the problems attached to traditional data lakes is the difficulty of retrieving data, which is slow to query, inefficiently, and with high complexities of schema evolution the ability of the data lake to optimize workloads dynamically. To overcome these problems, the work presented in this paper brings forward the concept of an AI-optimized data lake framework that exploits machine learning and deep learning for intelligent data ingestion, adaptive indexing as well as self-optimizing query execution. The system is proposed to incorporate hierarchical storage management with AI-driven, self-studying indexing mechanisms, and reinforcement learning-aided query optimization to improve data retrieval efficiency. Furthermore, through an integrated AI-powered anomaly detection system, data processing is made robust and reliable in real time. On top of that the framework also involves autonomous governance and security that can use explainable AI for compliance auditing and a dynamic role-based access control (RBAC). Experimental evaluations show that, with up to a 90% time saving, and with real-time decision-making capabilities, it improves over both aspects in a variety of data workloads. This research brings forth the integration of AI-based optimizations for the development of a broad and flexible framework for intelligently and scaleably building large data lake architectures, thus becoming the future-ready solution for any big data ecosystem within healthcare, financial, or IoT-based smart systems. © 2025 IEEE.","AI-driven; Hadoop Distributed File System; Healthcare; Role-based access control","Big data; Data handling; Decision making; Deep learning; Digital storage; Hierarchical systems; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Information management; Information retrieval; Lakes; Learning systems; Query processing; Search engines; AI-driven; Distributed file systems; Hadoop distributed file system; Healthcare; High complexity; Queries optimization; Real time data management; Real- time; Role-based Access Control; Schema evolution; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Nambiar, Athira M., An Overview of Data Warehouse and Data Lake in Modern Enterprise Data Management, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 6, 4, (2022); Gupta, Payal, AI-Enabled Process Optimization for Sustainable Wastewater Treatment Solutions, Springer Water, Part F3340, pp. 141-164, (2024); Guim, Francesc, Autonomous Lifecycle Management for Resource-Efficient Workload Orchestration for Green Edge Computing, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, 6, 1, pp. 571-582, (2022); Towards Ethical and Socially Responsible Explainable AI Challenges and Opportunities, (2024); Deploying AI in the Enterprise, (2020); He, Zilong, Research data management in institutional repositories: an architectural approach using data lakehouses, Digital Library Perspectives, 41, 1, pp. 145-178, (2025); International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, (2023); Journal of Bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence, (2021); Journal of Distributed Computing and Systems Jdcs, (2024); Omeiza, Daniel, Explanations in Autonomous Driving: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 23, 8, pp. 10142-10162, (2022)","G.

Dataflows and Notebooks in Fabric addressed regional inconsistencies and enabled efficient data transformation. Power BI reports provided intuitive and interactive visualizations for exploring geographic and temporal crime trends. Performance testing demonstrated up to 40% faster query response times compared to traditional warehouses, and regional crime analysis that previously took days was completed within hours.

This systematic mapping study analyzes many BDA architectures proposed in the literature, revealing a fragmented landscape in which the proposed architectures are largely conceptual with limited industrial validation. Our analysis identifies dominant technological patterns, such as Apache Kafka for ingestion, Spark for processing, and Hadoop and Hive for storage, with the majority of implementations favoring open-source solutions. Despite their theoretical importance, real-time analytics capabilities remain underutilized in practice. This study synthesizes a unified conceptual reference architecture with eight fundamental layers to provide a framework for comparative analysis. We document an imbalance in layer development: storage and processing receive comprehensive attention while querying, infrastructure management, and monitoring layers remain underdeveloped. Implementation approaches show distinct patterns in deployment strategies and data handling, with structured and semi-structured data well supported, whereas unstructured data integration presents ongoing challenges.

Traditional risk monitoring systems cannot effectively accommodate complex data flows and real-time risk changes, which often leads to false positives and delays. This study proposes a framework based on 'big data lake-semantic layer-intelligent algorithm' to achieve real-time and interpretable financial risk monitoring. Through the multi-modal risk representation combined with the hybrid flow-batch pipeline and knowledge graph, the real-time synchronization of risk scoring and response strategy is realized by using a state machine-driven feedback loop and adaptive threshold adjustment. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the framework is improved by more than 10%, the false alarm rate is reduced to 1.8%, and the response time is shortened to 250 milliseconds. This study improves the stability and responsiveness of the system through multi-modal learning and an adaptive threshold mechanism. © 2025 IGI Global.

In these fields, data are typically diverse in format and subject. Consequently, challenges in storing, tracking, and responsibly sharing valuable data have become increasingly evident over the past decades. To address the complexities, some approaches have leveraged standard strategies, such as using non-relational databases and data warehouses. However, these approaches often fall short in providing the flexibility and scalability required for complex projects. While the data lake paradigm has emerged to offer flexibility and handle large volumes of diverse data, it lacks robust data governance and organization. The data lakehouse is a new paradigm that combines the flexibility of a data lake with the governance of a data warehouse, offering a promising solution for managing heterogeneous data in bioinformatics. However, the lakehouse model remains unexplored in bioinformatics, with limited discussion in the current literature. In this study, we review strategies and tools for developing a data lakehouse infrastructure tailored to bioinformatics research. We summarize key concepts and assess available open-source and commercial solutions for managing data in bioinformatics.

Govt.Arts College for Women, Mayiladuthurai, India","The need for effective Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) technologies that can manage the growing volumes of both structured and unstructured data in information lakehouse architectures is increasing due to the rapid expansion of data environments. Existing ETL systems struggle with performance, scalability, and adaptability, making it difficult to handle the rising demands of both batch and real-time data processing. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Hybrid ETL Infrastructure that combines contextual data partitioning with AI-driven orchestration to optimize data ingestion and real-time analysis in information lakehouses. The system addresses key issues, such as inefficient data handling, slow processing times, and inadequate transformation methods, by dynamically adjusting the ETL pipeline based on user requests, context-aware partitioning, and data characteristics. The AI-driven orchestration ensures efficient job scheduling by seamlessly switching between batch and real-time processing based on data importance, thereby improving both performance and flexibility. Contextual partitioning reduces processing costs and enhances query performance by automatically organizing data according to domain-specific knowledge and query intent. The primary goal of this framework is to improve data transformation and loading performance in information lakehouses, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making. Preliminary results show a 30% reduction in ETL processing time and significant improvements in query efficiency and accuracy, particularly in complex, cross-domain data retrieval environments. The proposed approach offers a scalable, adaptable, and intelligent solution for modern data lakehouse scenarios, outperforming traditional ETL methods. © 2025 IEEE.","AI-Driven Orchestration; Batch Processing; Contextual Data Partitioning; Data Ingestion; Data Lakehouse; Data Transformation; Hybrid ETL Framework; Query Optimization; Real-Time Processing; Scalable Data Architecture","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Data accuracy; Data handling; Decision making; Information retrieval; Lakes; Metadata; Query processing; Real time systems; AI-driven orchestration; Batch processing; Contextual data partitioning; Data architectures; Data ingestions; Data lakehouse; Data partitioning; Data transformation; Extract transform loads; Hybrid extract, transform, load framework; Queries optimization; Realtime processing; Scalable data architecture; Batch data processing","","","","","","","Armbrust, Michael, Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics, 11th Annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, CIDR 2021, (2021); Data Lakehouse Evolution and Convergence of Data Lakes and Data Warehouses, (2022); Journal of Data Engineering, (2023); Databricks Whitepaper, (2022); Journal of Advanced Computing, (2022); IEEE Cloud Computing Journal, (2022); ACM Digital Library, (2023); Data Management Review, (2022); Information Systems Journal, (2023); Ieeetransactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, (2022)","K.

As data volumes and complexity continue to grow, the question arises: How can organizations effectively and efficiently manage their data to extract valuable insights? Two approaches, data mesh and data fabric, have emerged with the potential to revolutionize the current state of data architecture and help organizations redefine their data strategy. Although data mesh and data fabric are often viewed as contrasting approaches, they ultimately share the same goal of improving data management. While data mesh emphasizes decentralized responsibility and collaboration, data fabric focuses on unified infrastructure and data integration. Our paper aims to demonstrate how these two concepts challenge traditional paradigms and enable organizations to optimize their data utilization.

This paper introduces a novel hybrid data warehousing architecture designed for cloud service providers (CSPs), which integrates the strengths of Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Data Marts into a unified framework. This innovative architecture enables seamless integration and processing of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, addressing the challenges posed by diverse data types in cloud environments. Unlike traditional approaches that treat data processing in isolation, the proposed architecture supports both real-time and batch processing within a single system, improving query performance and facilitating dynamic decision-making. The architecture’s flexibility allows it to efficiently manage large datasets and adapt to fluctuating workloads. A key feature of this system is its focus on scalability, security, and real-time analytics, making it particularly suitable for CSPs across service models such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. The proposed hybrid repository model significantly enhances data governance and ensures robust data protection. By unifying different data storage models, it optimizes storage management and streamlines data access. © 2025 IEEE.","CSP; Data Lake; Data mart; DWH; ELT; ETL; OLAP","Access control; Batch data processing; Data privacy; Data warehouses; Information management; Network security; Storage management; Cloud service providers; Data lake; Data mart; ELT; ETL; OLAP; Seamless integration; Semistructured data; Unified framework; Unstructured data; Risk perception","","","","","","","Nambiar, Athira M., An Overview of Data Warehouse and Data Lake in Modern Enterprise Data Management, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 6, 4, (2022); Big Data Statistics, (2019); Sun, Zhaohao, Big Data Analytics Services for Enhancing Business Intelligence, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 58, 2, pp. 162-169, (2018); Fan, Shaokun, Demystifying Big Data Analytics for Business Intelligence Through the Lens of Marketing Mix, Big Data Research, 2, 1, pp. 28-32, (2015); Akter, Shahriar, Big data analytics in E-commerce: a systematic review and agenda for future research, Electronic Markets, 26, 2, pp. 173-194, (2016); Benefelds, Janis, Comparison of approaches in data warehouse development in financial services and higher education, ICEIS 2004 - Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, pp. 552-557, (2004); Sharma, Yashvardhan, Building a data warehousing infrastructure based on service oriented architecture, Proceedings of 2012 International Conference on Cloud Computing Technologies, Applications and Management, ICCCTAM 2012, pp. 82-87, (2012); Kashfi, Mehdi, Optimal distributed data warehouse system architecture, Proceedings - 4th IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing, BDCloud 2014 with the 7th IEEE International Conference on Social Computing and Networking, SocialCom 2014 and the 4th International Conference on Sustainable Computing and Communications, SustainCom 2014, pp. 110-115, (2014); Rifaie, Mohammad, Data warehouse architecture and design, 2008 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, IEEE IRI-2008, pp. 58-63, (2008); undefined","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","29th International Computer Conference, Computer Society of Iran, CSICC 2025","2025-02-05 through 2025-02-06","Tehran","208477","","9798331523114","","","English","Int.

Such decisions face three dedicated obstacles interesting for research analysis. First, such decisions in a greenfield setting have in many cases never been made before, reducing the access to historical information about manufacturing and transportation volumes, aggravated by new levels of uncertainty in many global manufacturing and transportation contexts. Second, at the same time, new data sources and computation capabilities become available in a digital Industry 4.0 setting, creating big data and data lake settings where traditional decision support methodologies have limited access and use in this regard. Third, an integrated evaluation of economic, environmental, and social sustainability aspects together with a resilience perspective is required as trade-offs between these different performance dimensions have to be incorporated. This paper outlines and addresses the three specific challenges by deriving a concept of how to integrate the three standard sustainability perspectives with the added resilience perspective and how to tailor this towards decision-making in a strategic, data-driven and digital setting of emerging green hydrogen supply chains. © 2025 The Authors.","big data; decision support; Green hydrogen; resilience; sustainability","Decision supports; Green hydrogen; Greenfield; Historical information; Hydrogen supply chains; Multi-perspective frameworks; Research analysis; Resilience; Strategic manufacturing; Transport modes; Hydrogen storage","","","","","","","Global Energy Perspective 2023, (2024); Ratnakar, Ram R., Hydrogen supply chain and challenges in large-scale LH2 storage and transportation, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 46, 47, pp. 24149-24168, (2021); Elvira, Kaneberg, Hydrogen technology for supply chain sustainability: The Mexican transportation impacts on society, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 47, 70, pp. 29999-30011, (2022); Wijayasekera, Sachindra C.N., Fueling tomorrow's commute: Current status and prospects of public bus transit fleets powered by sustainable hydrogen, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 66, pp. 170-184, (2024); Sgarbossa, Fabio, Renewable hydrogen supply chains: A planning matrix and an agenda for future research, International Journal of Production Economics, 255, (2023); Peng, Wei, Optimal strategies for production plan and carbon emission reduction in a hydrogen supply chain under cap-and-trade policy, Renewable Energy, 215, (2023); Corengia, Mariana, Coupling time varying power sources to production of green-hydrogen: A superstructure based approach for technology selection and optimal design, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 183, pp. 235-249, (2022); Smith, Connor, Towards a 100% hydrogen domestic gas network: Regulatory and commercial barriers to the first demonstrator project in the United Kingdom, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 47, 55, pp. 23071-23083, (2022); Ochoa-Robles, Jesús, Hydrogen supply chain design: Key technological components and sustainable assessment, Hydrogen Supply Chain: Design, Deployment and Operation, pp. 37-79, (2018); Fisher, Marshall L., Why empirical research is good for operations management, and what is good empirical operations management?, Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, 22, 1, pp. 170-178, (2020)","M.

It is necessary to have an effective approach to managing the resources and ecosystems of Earth, with the target of promoting sustainable development while meeting the needs and requirements of both present and future generations. Digital twin technology provides a fresh perspective on sustainable management with a better understanding of the interconnectedness of Earth's systems and accurate simulation and prediction of future changes. By integrating various types of data and models, including climate models, geophysical models, and social media data, a digital twin of Earth can simulate and analyze various aspects of the planet. The digital twin of Earth leverages real-time multi-source data integration through advanced IoT and wireless sensor networks, feeding into a data lake architecture that supports the seamless integration and processing of heterogeneous data. The integrated data then informs dynamic models, combining numerical simulation models with intelligent algorithms for enhanced prediction and analysis. This approach emphasizes the integration of environmental, social, and economic considerations into decision-making that balances economic growth, social well-being, and environmental protection to achieve sustainable development. This paper introduces the definition and information framework of the new concept of a digital twin of Earth to promote the current research on Earth management based on digital transformation techniques. © 2024 The Author(s).","","","","","","","(CBAS2023ORP03); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (U21A2013)","The work was supported by the Open Research Program of the International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals under Grant CBAS2023ORP03; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U21A2013.","Cheng, Hai J., Future Earth and Sustainable Developments, Innovation, 1, 3, (2020); Gong, Peng, iEarth: an interdisciplinary framework in the era of big data and AI for sustainable development, National Science Review, 10, 8, (2023); Guo, Huadong, Big Earth Data science: an information framework for a sustainable planet, International Journal of Digital Earth, 13, 7, pp. 743-767, (2020); Grieves, Michael W., Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Complex Systems: New Findings and Approaches, pp. 85-113, (2016); Caldarelli, Guido, The role of complexity for digital twins of cities, Nature Computational Science, 3, 5, pp. 374-381, (2023); Bauer, Peter, A digital twin of Earth for the green transition, Nature Climate Change, 11, 2, pp. 80-83, (2021); Frolov, Sergey, Road Map for the Next Decade of Earth System Reanalysis in the United States, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 104, 3, pp. E706-E714, (2023); Capone, Douglas G., Follow the nitrogen, Science, 312, 5774, pp. 708-709, (2006); Yang, Wei, The Innovation Geoscience: An international journal of Earth science, Innovation Geoscience, 1, 1, (2023); Popescu, Dragos C., Relational modeling framework for complex systems, UPB Scientific Bulletin, Series C: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 83, 1, pp. 15-28, (2021)","L.

These architectures are based on integrating heterogeneous data from different sources while ensuring that it is stored centrally. They also focus on data quality to guarantee the accuracy of analyses, and on reliable governance to ensure data compliance, security and traceability. These aspects are essential to enable optimal use of data for advanced analysis and informed decision-making in healthcare. Our objective in this article is to propose an architecture that ensures the 3 points: integration, storage and governance. The article proposes the DLMF architecture to ensure that these 3 points are adapted to good data analysis. This architecture uses the concept of a data lake for the consolidation and storage of data sources, a data mesh and a data fabric to ensure everything to do with data integration, quality and governance. The article also proposes a set of open-source technologies for its implementation.

Data is already in a transformed and structured format stored in a costly but reliable storage device. The data warehouse does not include all the data that may be not required at the time of construction of the data warehouse. With the advent of big data and to handle the data silos problem, the concept of Data Lake is introduced to handle data analysis.

We present the results from investigating the DDDM readiness of a Swedish organization in the food industry. We designed and developed a questionnaire to collect data about the organization's decision-making and IT systems. We conducted eleven interviews at the case study organization: ten with various functional decision-makers and one with the IT Manager about IT systems. The interview data were then analyzed against known decision theories and state-of-the-art DDDM. Based on the interview outcomes, we analyze the data according to the assessment model and recommend changes to the organization's readiness for data-driven decisions. The findings show that while the organization was assessed as ready in the decision-making process and decision-maker pillars, it was not ready in the data or analytics pillars. Accordingly, we recommend a set of actions, including considering integration and decision systems, further developing dashboards, increasing data and analytics resources (such as enterprise data warehouse, big data management tools, data lake environment, and data analytics algorithms), and defining key roles necessary for digitalization and DDDM (such as Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Business Intelligence Specialist, Chief Data Officer, and Data Warehouse Designer/Administrator).

Unlike typical data warehouses, which need data structure for storage, data lakes allow you to store raw data in its natural state. This adaptability makes data lakes suitable for storing large volumes of various data kinds, including photographs, videos, log files, sensor data, and others. When integrating a data lake with Power Business Intelligence (BI), organizations can harness the power of both technologies to gain valuable insights from their data. In the realm of data-driven decision-making, organizations face the challenge of managing and extracting insights from vast and diverse datasets, a task conventional on-premises storage solutions often struggle with due to the exponential growth of data. Thus, the adoption of more scalable and flexible alternatives becomes imperative. Cloud-based data lakes emerge as transformative solutions, offering unparalleled scalability, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and advanced security protocols. This paper discuss the concept of constructing a cloud-based data lake optimized for Power BI, leveraging leading cloud storage services like Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) and Amazon S3. By seamlessly integrating Power BI with the cloud data lake, organizations can overcome traditional storage limitations and reap numerous benefits. The practical applications in advanced analytics, customer insights, IoT data management, and data discovery underscore the real-world utility of cloud data lakes. The integration of Power BI with a cloud data lake augments efficient data analysis and self-service analytics potential, offering organizations a comprehensive solution for deriving actionable insights from their data assets. © 2024 IEEE.","Cloud data integration; Cloud storage; Data flows; Data Lake; Power BI","Data integration; Data warehouses; Business-intelligence; Cloud data; Cloud data integration; Cloud storage services; Cloud storages; Cloud-based; Data lake; Dataflow; Power; Power business intelligence; Decision making","","","","","","","Tovernic, Silvia, Solution for detecting sensitive data inside a data lake, 2018 41st International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2018 - Proceedings, pp. 1284-1288, (2018); Examining Cloud Computing Technologies Through the Internet of Things, (2018); Design of A Data Lake Architecture for the Healthcare Use Case Problems and Solutions, (2025); Cuzzocrea, Alfredo, Big data lakes: Models, frameworks, and techniques, Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing, BigComp 2021, pp. 1-4, (2021); Nambiar, Athira M., An Overview of Data Warehouse and Data Lake in Modern Enterprise Data Management, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 6, 4, (2022); Eder, Johann, Data quality for federated medical data lakes, International Journal of Web Information Systems, 17, 5, pp. 407-426, (2021); Ramchand, Sonam, Big data architectures for data lakes: A systematic literature review, Proceedings - 2022 IEEE 46th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2022, pp. 1141-1146, (2022); International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology Irjet, (2020); Data Lake Development with Big Data, (2015); Big Data Analyses Services and Smart Data, (2021)","V.V.

Although a variety of indices exist to assess digital health systems, questions arise about the inclusion of indicators of information and communications technology maturity and readiness, digital (health) literacy, and interest in DiPH tools by the society and workforce, as well as the maturity of the legal framework and the readiness of digitalized health systems. Existing tools frequently target one of these domains while overlooking the others. In addition, no review has yet holistically investigated the available national DiPH system maturity and readiness indicators using a multidisciplinary lens. Objective: We used a narrative review to map the landscape of DiPH system maturity and readiness indicators published in the gray literature. Methods: As original indicators were not published in scientific databases, we applied predefined search strings to the DuckDuckGo and Google search engines for 11 countries from all continents that had reached level 4 of 5 in the latest Global Digital Health Monitor evaluation. In addition, we searched the literature published by 19 international organizations for maturity and readiness indicators concerning DiPH. Results: Of the 1484 identified references, 137 were included, and they yielded 15,806 indicators. We deemed 286 indicators from 90 references relevant for DiPH system maturity and readiness assessments. The majority of these indicators (133/286, 46.5%) had legal relevance (targeting big data and artificial intelligence regulation, cybersecurity, national DiPH strategies, or health data governance), and the smallest number of indicators (37/286, 12.9%) were related to social domains (focusing on internet use and access, digital literacy and digital health literacy, or the use of DiPH tools, smartphones, and computers). Another 14.3% (41/286) of indicators analyzed the information and communications technology infrastructure (such as workforce, electricity, internet, and smartphone availability or interoperability standards). The remaining 26.2% (75/286) of indicators described the degree to which DiPH was applied (including health data architecture, storage, and access; the implementation of DiPH interventions; or the existence of interventions promoting health literacy and digital inclusion). Conclusions: Our work is the first to conduct a multidisciplinary analysis of the gray literature on DiPH maturity and readiness assessments. Although new methods for systematically researching gray literature are needed, our study holds the potential to develop more comprehensive tools for DiPH system assessments. We contributed toward a more holistic understanding of DiPH. Further examination is required to analyze the suitability and applicability of all identified indicators in diverse health care settings. By developing a standardized method to assess DiPH system maturity and readiness, we aim to foster informed decision-making among health care planners and practitioners to improve resource distribution and continue to drive innovation in health care delivery. ©Laura Maaß, Manuel Badino, Ihoghosa Iyamu, Felix Holl.","digital health; digital public health; gray literature; health system; indicator; information and communications technology; interdisciplinary; maturity assessment; mobile phone; narrative review; readiness assessment","digital technology; human; procedures; public health; Digital Technology; Humans; Public Health","","","","","British Institute of Persian Studies, BIPS; Leibniz-Gemeinschaft, LG, (W72/2022); Leibniz-Gemeinschaft, LG","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of Leibniz Science Campus Bremen Digital Public Health, which is jointly funded by the Leibniz Association (W72/2022), the federal state of Bremen, and the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology\u2013BIPS.","Report of the Expert Panel on Effective Ways of Investing in Health Exph, (2019); Saiso, Sebastián García, Digital Transformation for More Equitable and Sustainable Public Health in the Age of Digital Interdependence, American Journal of Public Health, 112, pp. S621-S624, (2022); Iyamu, Ihoghosa Osamuyi, Defining digital public health and the role of digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation: Scoping review, JMIR Public Health and Surveillance, 7, 11, (2021); Odone, Anna, Public health digitalization in Europe, European Journal of Public Health, 29, pp. 28-35, (2019); Gunasekeran, Dinesh Visva, Digital health during COVID-19: lessons from operationalising new models of care in ophthalmology, The Lancet Digital Health, 3, 2, pp. e124-e134, (2021); Kickbusch, Ilona S., The Lancet and Financial Times Commission on governing health futures 2030: growing up in a digital world, The Lancet, 398, 10312, pp. 1727-1776, (2021); Future of the Public S Health in the 21st Century, (2003); Digital Technologies for Key Public Health Functions Results of an Ecdc Expert Consultation, (2021); Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020 2025; Golden Opportunity of Digital Health for Latin America and the Caribbean, (2022)","L.

The advent of big data has profoundly influenced businesses, empowering them to adeptly manage and analyze vast datasets. In the realm of business intelligence, particularly in decision-making, data warehouses play a crucial role, leveraging OLAP technology for the efficient analysis of structured data. Constructed by amalgamating data from diverse sources, a data warehouse faces the challenge of accommodating big data-comprising unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data from myriad sources-where alterations in content and structure are frequent. To address this, our paper introduces a temporal multidimensional model utilizing a graph formalism for multi-version data warehouses, adept at assimilating changes from data sources. This approach relies on multi-version evolution for schema modifications and employs bi-temporal labeling for entities and their relationships to capture data evolution. Our proposal enhances data warehouse evolution flexibility, broadening analysis possibilities within the decision support system, and enabling adaptable temporal queries to yield consistent results. Building upon our prior work [6], where we presented the GAMM model emphasizing evolutionary data treatment, including dimensional changes, this study expands on the temporal labeling principle in our approach. It delves into various functions governing the evolution of temporal data, offering illustrative examples. We validate our approach through a case study demonstrating temporal queries and conduct runtime performance tests on graph data warehouses. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Data evolution; Graph-based database; Multidimensional model; NoSQL; Slowly changing dimension; Temporal data warehouse; Temporal query","Data assimilation; Data centers; Data warehouses; Structured Query Language; Data evolution; Graph-based; Graph-based database; Multi-dimensional model; NoSQL; Slowly changing dimension; Structured data; Temporal Data; Temporal data warehouse; Temporal queries; Spatio-temporal data","","","","","","","Ahmed, Waqas, A Temporal Multidimensional Model and OLAP Operators, International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining, 16, 4, pp. 112-143, (2020); Zimanyi E Vansummeren S Calders T Eds Actes Des 11es Journees Francophones Sur Les Entrepots De Donnees Et Lanalyse En Ligne Rnti Vol B 11 Pp 3348, (2015); Akoka, Jacky, Mapping Multidimensional Schemas to Property Graph Models, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 13012 LNCS, pp. 3-14, (2021); Business Intelligence Big Data, (2022); Benhissen, Redha, GAMM: Graph-Based Agile Multidimensional Model, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 3369, pp. 23-32, (2023); Gusikhin O Hammoudi S Cuzzocrea A Eds Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Data Science Technology and Applications Data 2023 Rome Italy 1113 July 2023 Pp 4051 Scitepress, (2023); Systematic Change Management in Dimensional Data Warehousing, (1998); Böhlen, Michael H., Temporal Data Management – An Overview, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 324, pp. 51-83, (2018); Towards Temporal Graph Databases Arxiv Preprint Arxiv, (2016); Debrouvier, Ariel, A model and query language for temporal graph databases, VLDB Journal, 30, 5, pp. 825-858, (2021)","R.

We present Triage-Bot, an online medical triage provisioning service, that can revolutionize emergency care by decreasing the load on emergency departments (ED), reducing healthcare expenses, and improving the quality of care. Empowered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the Triage-Bot service assesses and prioritizes patients' needs based on symptoms, medical history, and perceived conditions from multimodal video, audio, and text data captured during patients' interactions. The captured summarized information with a severity ranking is sent to a human expert to suggest the next action on the user's part. The diverse data types used by the Triage-Bot in communication, authentication, data collection, storage, and analytics requires a robust and scalable system architecture for online service provisioning. In this paper, we specifically focus on the system design and architecture of the Triage-Bot for emergency healthcare settings. With integrated electronic medical records (EMR) and online platforms, the bot fosters collaboration among healthcare professionals and enables swift and informed decision-making even in the face of crises. By partially automating and offering a hybrid triage process, the Triage-Bot improves resource allocation, reduces healthcare management costs for emergency care, minimizes patient waiting times, and improves wellbeing. To address the complexities and demands of healthcare data management, our proposed system incorporates MongoDB database for flexibility, scalability, and versatility in supporting different types of data. Additionally, we implement a data linking and analytics pipeline utilizing a data Lakehouse system to effectively ingest, manage, process, and generate knowledge from heterogeneous data sources. © 2024 IEEE.","Data Lakehouse; Database; Healthcare Management; Triage bot","COVID-19; Electronic health record; Emergency services; Hospital data processing; Information management; Metadata; Network security; Quality of service; Steganography; Data analytics; Data lakehouse; Emergency care; Emergency departments; Emergency healthcares; Health-care managements; Healthcare systems; Management architectures; Triage bot; Web based; Decision making","","","","","International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Mitacs; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","We gratefully acknowledge the support of NSERC Canada, CFI, IBM, Mitacs, IBM and MarkiTech for their funding of our project","Li, Wei, A Comprehensive Survey on Machine Learning-Based Big Data Analytics for IoT-Enabled Smart Healthcare System, Mobile Networks and Applications, 26, 1, pp. 234-252, (2021); Awotunde, Joseph Bamidele, Big Data and Data Analytics for an Enhanced COVID-19 Epidemic Management, Studies in Systems, Decision and Control, 358, pp. 11-29, (2021); Leclerc, Thomas, Prioritisation of ICU treatments for critically ill patients in a COVID-19 pandemic with scarce resources, Anaesthesia Critical Care and Pain Medicine, 39, 3, pp. 333-339, (2020); Townsend, Beverley A., Medical practitioner perspectives on AI in emergency triage, Frontiers in Digital Health, 5, (2023); Salman, Omar Hussein, A review on utilizing machine learning technology in the fields of electronic emergency triage and patient priority systems in telemedicine: Coherent taxonomy, motivations, open research challenges and recommendations for intelligent future work, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 209, (2021); Handbook of Global Health, (2020); Bullard, Michael J., Revisions to the Canadian emergency department triage and acuity scale (CTAS) guidelines, Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine, 16, 6, pp. 485-489, (2014); Nam Perspectives, (2020); Sadman, Nafiz, Vulnerability of Open-Source Face Recognition Systems to Blackbox Attacks: A Case Study with InsightFace, 2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2023, pp. 1164-1169, (2023); Pepin, Ian, Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Keyword-Based Classification of Unstructured Text Data, Proceedings - 2024 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things, DCOSS-IoT 2024, pp. 203-210, (2024)","","Shahriar, H.; Ohsaki, H.; Sharmin, M.; Towey, D.; Majumder, AKM.J.A.; Hori, Y.; Yang, J.-J.; Takemoto, M.; Sakib, N.; Banno, R.; Ahamed, S.I.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","48th IEEE Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2024","2024-07-02 through 2024-07-04","Osaka","202071","","9798350376968","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Annu.

As data grows, novel methods are needed for data aggregation by means of indicators and multi-dimensional analysis of Data Lakes content, enabling exploration of data according to various dimensions, thus empowering users with diverse roles and competencies to capitalise on the available information. In this paper, we present a computer-aided approach (named PERSEUS, PERSonalised Exploration by User Support) for data exploration on top of a Data Lake. The approach is structured over three phases: (i) the construction of a semantic metadata catalog on top of the Data Lake; (ii) the creation of an Exploration Graph, based on metadata contained in the catalog, containing the semantic representation of indicators and analysis dimensions; (iii) the enrichment of the definition of indicators with personalisation aspects (based on users' profiles and preferences) to identify Exploration Contexts, in turn delimiting portions of the Exploration Graph for a personalised and interactive exploration of indicators. Results of an experimental evaluation in the Smart City domain are presented with the aim of demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Big Data; OLAP; personalised data exploration; semantic data lake","Data aggregation; Data driven decision; Data exploration; Decisions makings; Novel methods; OLAP; Personalized data exploration; Semantic data; Semantic data lake; Volume velocities","","","","","","","Nargesian, Fatemeh, Data lake management: Challenges and opportunities, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 12, 12, pp. 1986-1989, (2018); Bianchini, Devis, A semantics-enabled approach for personalised Data Lake exploration, Knowledge and Information Systems, 66, 2, pp. 1469-1502, (2024); Bianchini, Devis, Data management challenges for smart living, Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST, 189, pp. 131-137, (2018); Stands4 Web Services Abbreviations API, (2024); Miller, George A., WordNet: A Lexical Database for English, Communications of the ACM, 38, 11, pp. 39-41, (1995); Vandenbussche, Pierre Yves, Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV): A gateway to reusable semantic vocabularies on the Web, Semantic Web, 8, 3, pp. 437-452, (2017); Protege A Free Open Source Ontology Editor and Framework for Building Intelligent Systems, (2024); A Semantics Enabled Approach for Personalised Data Lake Exploration, (2021); VLDB, (2002); Bangor, Aaron W., An empirical evaluation of the system usability scale, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 24, 6, pp. 574-594, (2008)","M.

This siloed approach creates a lock-in scenario, limiting the potential for effective data exploitation, including the provision of added-value services, artificial intelligence, or machine-learning activities. To overcome this challenge, ensuring data integration through interoperability mechanisms becomes crucial within building data management frameworks. In line with this perspective, this work introduces a data lake that harmonizes heterogeneous data sources from various building domains. The primary goal is to standardize datasets, ensuring the delivery of high-quality services to facilitate better decision-making.

This trend has transformed traditional industrial production by exploiting Digital Twin (DT) models as virtual representations of physical manufacturing assets. In the railway industry, Digital Twin models offer significant benefits by enabling anticipation of developments in rail systems and subsystems, providing insight into the future performance of physical assets, and allowing testing and prototyping solutions prior to implementation. This paper presents our approach for creating a Digital Twin model in the railway domain. We particularly emphasize the critical role of Big Data in supporting decision-making for railway companies and the importance of data in creating virtual representations of physical objects in railway systems. Our results show that the Digital Twin model of railway switch points, based on synthetic data, accurately represents the behavior of physical railway switches in terms of data points. © 2020 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Big data; digital twin; machine learning; railway industry; synthetic data","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer architecture; Decision making; E-learning; Learning systems; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; Data architectures; Key feature; Machine-learning; Rail transportation; Railway industry; Railway signal; Railway switches; Synthetic data; Virtual representations; Data structures","","","","","","","Errandonea, Itxaro, Digital Twin for maintenance: A literature review, Computers in Industry, 123, (2020); Thaduri, Adithya, Railway assets: A potential domain for big data analytics, Procedia Computer Science, 53, 1, pp. 457-467, (2015); Ghofrani, Faeze, Recent applications of big data analytics in railway transportation systems: A survey, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 90, pp. 226-246, (2018); Xu, Quan, A Platform for Fault Diagnosis of High-Speed Train based on Big Data, 51, 18, pp. 309-314, (2018); Kaewunruen, Sakdirat, Digital twin for sustainability evaluation of railway station buildings, Frontiers in Built Environment, 4, (2018); Nold, Michael, How Will the Railway Look Like in 2050?

Advanced ICT and data mining technologies can change the trading market operation. The existing systems are confronted with certain constraints, including incomplete data, insufficient documentation for storage, and a requirement for a scalable infrastructure for big data analytics, such as a data warehouse or data lakehouse. To address this issue, the paper presents a design and implementation of a coffee commodity trading big data warehouse capable of analyzing various essential parameters for supporting informed decision-making. First, the designed system can automatically collect coffee trading data for New York Arabica coffee futures prices from selected worldwide reports and financial data portals. Next, the Extract, transform, and load (ETL) process is adopted to ingest coffee futures trading crawled data into the 3 layers data warehouse. Finally, the analytical system will extract and visualize selected key dimensions that influence coffee futures prices within different observation windows and perspectives. As a result, we implement a prototype of a coffee trading data warehouse on the crawled data from January 2000 to October 2022 and visualize trends in coffee futures prices based on the collected data for informed decision-making. The construction system is capable of stably operating and processing large volumes of transaction data. This paper will be valuable documentation for reference and decision support for coffee commodity trading enterprises and contribute to the development of future forecasting algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.","big data; Coffee big data; coffee commodity trading; data visualization; data warehouse; ETL process; informed decision-making","Big data; Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Data visualization; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Financial markets; Visualization; Coffee big data; Coffee commodity trading; Commodities trading; Data mining technology; Decisions makings; Extract, transform, and load process; Informed decision; Informed decision-making; Market data; Predictive models; Decision making","","","","","","","Ponte, Stefano, The 'Latte Revolution'?

Such analytics services use AI techniques to extract useful knowledge on collected data from energy infrastructure like smart meters and sensors. The big data value chain describes the steps of big data life cycle from collecting, pre-processing, storing and querying energy consumption data for high-level user-driven services. With the exponential growth of networking capabilities and the Internet of Things (IoT), data from the energy sector is arriving with a high throughput taking the problem of calculating big data analytics to a new level. This research will review existing approaches for big data energy analytics services and will further propose a framework for facilitating AI-enabled energy analytics taking into consideration all the requirements of analytics services through the entire big data value chain from data acquisition and batch and stream data ingestion, to creating proper querying mechanisms. Those query mechanisms will in turn enable the execution of queries on huge volumes of energy consumption data with low latency, and establishing high-level data visualizations.

Therefore, the question of “how could SMEs leverage big data in view of their limited resources as compared to large firms?” remains unanswered. This chapter assesses the realities concerning SMEs adoption of big data and proposes guiding measures to help SMEs overcome the impeding challenges and optimize their use, particularly for better decision making. While SMEs limited adoption of big data is attributed to the limited resources, complexity and/or underestimation of their benefits, the main challenges are often cost, data privacy and security, lack of inhouse capabilities, lack of IT skills and analytic expertise, and lack of a supportive culture. We argue that a successful big data system must encompass key budgets, IT infrastructure, data architecture, management/governance, security/privacy, data analytics and skilled workforce. Measures of big data’s effective application and implications are discussed. © 2025 by IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

Big Data about the human environment and the effect of natural and human-caused disasters (in this case: heat islands, earthquakes and lava flows, and landmine contamination) on that environment have been available to many people for years and are the subject of discussions, but there are still numerous research challenges in the form of structuring and storing data and analysis results. This implies certain requirements for efficient integration, access and querying of the various data in the data repository for the described purpose. Data lakes and data warehouses are offered as solutions to this problem. Well-designed data lakes can be a basic building block for different solutions in the analysis of the effects of disasters on the environment, and high-quality data warehouses for modelling future potential disasters in the same area. This paper presents certain personal observations and certain proposals for the creation of efficient data lakes and data warehouses (based on many years of work on problems in areas: humanitarian demining, heat islands and volcanic activity) for the needs of decision-making in crisis based on examples from practice. The goal is to influence the development of a unique framework for the creation and maintenance of a data lake, in terms of its better utilization so that it does not become a data swamp. © Author(s) 2023.","Crisis Management; Data Lakes; Heat Islands; Humanitarian Demining; Volcanic Activity","Behavioral research; Data warehouses; Decision making; Disasters; Explosives; Quality control; Volcanoes; Crisis management; Data lake; Data repositories; Heat island; Human environment; Humanitarian demining; Landmine; Lava flows; Research challenges; Volcanic activities; Lakes","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (857592, DOK-01-2020); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ","This research is part of the Twinning Open Data Operational project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 857592.

Flooding has a major impact on people's lives and livelihoods. The impact of flood disasters on human lives can be mitigated by developing effective flood forecasting and prediction models. The majority of flood prediction models do not take all flood-causing factors into account when they are designed. It is difficult to collect and handle some of these flood-causing variables since they are heterogeneous in nature. This paper presents a new big data architecture called Data Lake, which can ingest and store all important flood-causing heterogeneous data sources in their raw format for machine learning model creation. The statistical relevance of important flood producing factors on flood prediction outcome is determined utilizing inferential statistical approaches. The outcome of this research is to create flood warning systems that can alert the public and government officials so that they can make decisions in the event of a severe flood, reducing socioeconomic loss. • Flood causing factors are from heterogeneous sources, so there is no big data architecture for handling variety of data sources. • To provide data architectural solution using data lake for collecting and analysing heterogeneous flood causing factors. • Uses inferential statistical approach to determine importance of different flood causing factors in design of efficient flood prediction models. © 2023 The Author(s)","Data Lake; Flood causing vital factors; Flood Prediction","article; big data; data source; decision support system; flooding; government employee; human; machine learning; prediction; statistical significance","","","","","","","Ndtv, (2019); undefined; International Journal of Computer Applications, (2015); Zhang, Meng, Secure beamforming for untrusted MISO cognitive radio networks, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 17, 7, pp. 4861-4872, (2018); International Journal of Geomatics and Geosciences, (2010); Biosci Biotechnol Res Commun Spec Issue, (2019); Bande, Swapnil, Smart flood disaster prediction system using IoT & neural networks, Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference On Smart Technology for Smart Nation, SmartTechCon 2017, pp. 189-194, (2018); Widiasari, Indrastanti Ratna, Deep learning multilayer perceptron (MLP) for flood prediction model using wireless sensor network based hydrology time series data mining, Proceedings - 2017 International Conference on Innovative and Creative Information Technology: Computational Intelligence and IoT, ICITech 2017, 2018-January, pp. 1-5, (2017); Khanna, Nitin, OFFM-ANFIS analysis for flood prediction using mobile IoS, fog and cloud computing, Cluster Computing, 23, 4, pp. 2659-2676, (2020); Sood, Sandeep K., IoT, big data and HPC based smart flood management framework, Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems, 20, pp. 102-117, (2018)","B.D.

However, the usage of FAIR-compliant data catalogs lacks empirical studies due to its novelty. This study aims to promote the practical adoption of data catalogs as a means to manage the expanding data landscape. We differentiate our contribution by providing an empirical evaluation and comparison of IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog (IBM-WKC), a leading data cataloging solution, with two other prominent alternatives, Open-Metadata and Data-Galaxy, for extracting relevant information from data lakes containing heterogeneous data sources in their native formats. Our proposed methodology utilizes an innovative tool built on IBM-WKC for annotating collected documents. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on a dataset of 100 documents sourced from scientific databases. Moreover, to assess our proposal, we compare the retrieved text to the appropriate interventions that use the original checklist. The results demonstrate the superiority of IBM-WKC over its competitors, showcasing its enhanced performance in addressing data cataloging challenges. Notably, the tested queries achieved an impressive accuracy, precision, and recall value of 96%.

Thus, the problem of integrating spatial data into existing databases and information systems has been addressed by creating spatial extensions to relational tables or by creating spatial data warehouses, while arranging data structures and query languages by making them more spatially-aware. With the advent of Big Data, these conventional storage and spatial representation structures are becoming increasingly outdated, and required a new organization of spatial data. Approaches based on distributed storage and data lakes have been proposed, to integrate the complexity of spatial data, with operational and analytical systems which unfortunately quickly showed their limits. Recently the concept of lakehouse was introduced in order to integrate, among other things, the notion of reliability and ACID properties to the volume of data to be managed. This new data architecture is a combination of governed and reliable Data Warehouses and flexible, scalable and cost-effective Data Lakes. In this paper, we present how traditional approaches of spatial data management in the context of spatial big data have quickly shown their limits. We present a literature overview of these approaches, and how they led to the Data LakeHouse. We detail how the Lakehouse paradigm can be used and extended for managing spatial big data, by giving the different components and best practices for building a spatial data LakeHouse architecture optimized for the storage and computing over spatial big data. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Data architecture; Data LakeHouse; Distributed systems; Spatial data; Storage","Big data; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Digital storage; Information management; Lakes; Query languages; Query processing; Search engines; Semantics; Data architectures; Data lakehouse; Decision-making process; Distributed systems; Relational tables; Spatial data; Spatial data warehouse; Spatial extension; Spatial representations; Spatially aware; Data warehouses","","","","","","","Aji, Ablimit, Hadoop gis: A high performance spatial data warehousing system over mapreduce, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 6, 11, pp. 1009-1020, (2013); Corr, (2015); Armbrust, Michael, Delta Lake: High-Performance ACID Table Storage over Cloud Object Stores, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 13, 12, pp. 3411-3424, (2020); Armbrust, Michael, Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics, 11th Annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, CIDR 2021, (2021); Baig, Furqan, Accelerating Spatial Cross-Matching on CPU-GPU Hybrid Platform With CUDA and OpenACC, Frontiers in Big Data, 3, (2020); Behm, Alexander, Photon: A Fast Query Engine for Lakehouse Systems, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 2326-2339, (2022); Belussi, Alberto, Skewness-based partitioning in spatialhadoop, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 9, 4, (2020); Borrell, Ricard, Parallel mesh partitioning based on space filling curves, Computers and Fluids, 173, pp. 264-272, (2018); IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin, (2015); Chen, Tzuyang, On Construction of a Power Data Lake Platform Using Spark, Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 542, pp. 99-108, (2019)","S.

Therefore, underground water resources used in the region are incrementing exponentially. However, temporal and spatial underground water information concerning availability and quality is scarce, disabling proper decision making. In order to close that breach, we propose and embedded edge-processing Internet of Things (IoT)-based water quality monitoring system. This letter introduces the design and implementation of this solution, specifically targeted to monitor irrigation and drinking water extracted from water wells. The system is designed to be deployed in central Chile, considering the topographic conditions, which severely affect power availability and communication resources.

The benefits of deep learning (DL) are manifold, but it comes with limitations that have – so far – interfered with widespread industry adoption. This paper explains why DL – despite its popularity – has difficulties speeding up its adoption within business analytics. It is shown that the adoption of deep learning is not only affected by computational complexity, lacking big data architecture, lack of transparency (black-box), skill shortage, and leadership commitment, but also by the fact that DL does not outperform traditional ML models in the case of structured datasets with fixed-length feature vectors. Deep learning should be regarded as a powerful addition to the existing body of ML models instead of a “one size fits all” solution. The results strongly suggest that gradient boosting can be seen as the go-to model for predictions on structured datasets within business analytics. In addition to the empirical study based on three industry use cases, the paper offers a comprehensive discussion of those results, practical implications, and a roadmap for future research. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Business analytics; Data-driven decision making; Deep Learning; Digital strategy; Digital transformation; Machine learning","","","","","","","","Addo, Peter Martey, Credit risk analysis using machine and deep learning models, Risks, 6, 2, (2018); Economics of Artificial Intelligence an Agenda, (2019); Baesens, Bart M.M., Transformational issues of big data and analytics in networked business, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 40, 4, pp. 807-818, (2016); Bertsimas, Dimitris J., From predictive to prescriptive analytics, Management Science, 66, 3, pp. 1025-1044, (2020); Borges, Aline De Fatima Soares, The strategic use of artificial intelligence in the digital era: Systematic literature review and future research directions, International Journal of Information Management, 57, (2021); Breiman, Leo, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Bücker, Michael, Transparency, auditability, and explainability of machine learning models in credit scoring, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 73, 1, pp. 70-90, (2022); Artificial Intelligence, (2017); undefined, (2019); Chen, Hsinchun Chun, Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impact, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 36, 4, pp. 1165-1188, (2012)","","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","","","","","English","Int.

This research paper aims to demystify the situation of the fish farming domain in general by shedding light on big data generated in fish farms. The purpose is to propose a dedicated data lake functional architecture and extend it to a technical architecture to initiate a fish farming data-driven strategy. The research opted for an exploratory study to explore the existing big data technologies and to propose an architecture applicable to the fish farming data-driven strategy. The paper provides a review of how big data technologies offer multiple advantages for decision making and enabling prediction use cases.

It represents a real competitive economic and strategic lever. The most reputable companies are not only concerned with collecting data from heterogeneous data sources, but also with analyzing and transforming these datasets into better decision-making. In this context, the data lake continues to be a powerful solution for storing large amounts of data and providing data analytics for decision support. In this paper, we examine the intelligent data lake management system that addresses the drawbacks of traditional business intelligence, which is no longer capable of handling data-driven demands. Data lakes are highly suitable for analyzing data from a variety of sources, particularly when data cleaning is time-consuming. However, ingesting heterogeneous data sources without any schema represents a major issue, and a data lake can easily turn into a data swamp. In this study, we implement the LDA topic model for managing the storage, processing, analysis, and visualization of big data. To assess the usefulness of our proposal, we evaluated its performance based on the topic coherence metric. The results of these experiments showed our approach to be more accurate on the tested datasets. © 2023; Los autores.","Big Data; Business Intelligence; Data Lake; LDA; Topic Modeling","","","","","","","","Fang, Huang, Managing data lakes in big data era: What's a data lake and why has it became popular in data management ecosystem, 2015 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control and Intelligent Systems, IEEE-CYBER 2015, pp. 820-824, (2015); Kim, Mi, A Suggestion on the LDA-Based Topic Modeling Technique Based on ElasticSearch for Indexing Academic Research Results, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 6, (2022); Suriarachchi, Isuru, Crossing analytics systems: A case for integrated provenance in data lakes, Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on e-Science, e-Science 2016, pp. 349-354, (2017); Costa Silva, Camila Mariane, Topic modeling in software engineering research, Empirical Software Engineering, 26, 6, (2021); Huang, Shih Chia, Big Data Analytics and Business Intelligence in Industry, Information Systems Frontiers, 19, 6, pp. 1229-1232, (2017); Data Lake Architecture Designing the Data Lake and Avoiding the Garbage Dump, (2016); Yang, Xinli, Characterizing malicious Android apps by mining topic-specific data flow signatures, Information and Software Technology, 90, pp. 27-39, (2017); Cherradi, Mohamed, Data Lake Management Based on DLDS Approach, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 237, pp. 679-690, (2022); Cherradi, Mohamed, Grover’s Algorithm for Data Lake Optimization Queries, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 13, 8, pp. 568-576, (2022); Terrizzano, Ignacio G., Data wrangling: The challenging journey from the wild to the lake, CIDR 2015 - 7th Biennial Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, (2015)","","","Editorial Salud, Ciencia y Tecnologia","","","","","","","","","","English","Data.

Our work is part of a medical application that aims to help healthcare professionals analyze complex data for decision-making. We propose mechanisms that promote data accessibility. The data are stored in a Data Warehouse (DW) that is periodically built from a data lake. Depending on the needs of the decision-maker, data are extracted from the DW and transferred to a Data Mart (DM) for querying. In this paper, we present a schema recommendation system based on the principle of collaborative filtering. This system can predict the DM schemas that were developed in the past that best match the data need expressed by a decision-maker. It does this by comparing the attributes present in the schemas with the attributes deduced from the need to propose a list of predictions for the most suitable schemas. The technique used is simple, while allowing us to solve the problem of periodic updates to the source data.

To facilitate data-driven decision-making, big data analytics—focused on identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in large data sets—is indispensable. While traditional statistical techniques are useful, new tools and infrastructures such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL are essential to tackle big data challenges. However, modifying the existing environment can be impractical, especially in production settings, due to the need for significant investment and specialized expertise. This article presents a novel computational paradigm that adds a decision-making layer atop existing systems for data analysis, eliminating the need to alter the environment. The approach treats the current information system as a data lake and introduces a new data recovery layer through web services, drawing inspiration from big data technologies like MapReduce. This system offers the advantage of being modular, reusable, and universally compatible, making it an independent decisional framework that can work with any information system or data source. © 2023 IEEE.","Big Data; Data Analysis; Data Science; Design Pattern; Paradigm","Cloud analytics; Data Analytics; Data integration; Decision making; Information analysis; Information systems; Information use; Internet of things; Lakes; Web services; Cloud data; Cloud-computing; Cutting edge technology; Data analytics; Data driven decision; Decisions makings; Design Patterns; Modular approach; Paradigm; Service process; Big data","","","","","","","Abawajy, Jemal H., Comprehensive analysis of big data variety landscape, International Journal of Parallel, Emergent and Distributed Systems, 30, 1, pp. 5-14, (2015); Al-Kababji, Ayman, Interactive visual study for residential energy consumption data, Journal of Cleaner Production, 366, (2022); Ali, Syed Mohd, Big data visualization: Tools and challenges, Proceedings of the 2016 2nd International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Informatics, IC3I 2016, pp. 656-660, (2016); Alsalemi, Abdullah, Cloud energy micro-moment data classification: A platform study, Proceedings - 2020 IEEE/ACM 13th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, UCC 2020, pp. 420-425, (2020); Atalla, Shadi, An Intelligent Recommendation System for Automating Academic Advising Based on Curriculum Analysis and Performance Modeling, Mathematics, 11, 5, (2023); Benbelkacem, Samir, COVI3D: Automatic COVID-19 CT Image-Based Classification and Visualization Platform Utilizing Virtual and Augmented Reality Technologies, Diagnostics, 12, 3, (2022); Encyclopedia of Big Data Technologies, (2018); Mckinsey Quarterly, (2010); Chen, C.

Traditional production systems, often marred by inefficiencies stemming from data opacity, have encountered bottlenecks that throttle scalability and adaptability, particularly in complex, fluctuating markets. By harnessing the voluminous streams of data-both structured and unstructured-generated in contemporary production environments, and subjecting these data lakes to advanced ML algorithms, we unveil profound insights and predictive patterns that remain elusive under conventional analytical methods. Our discourse juxtaposes the multidimensionality of Big Data-emphasizing velocity, variety, veracity, and volume-with the finesse of ML models, such as neural networks and reinforcement learning, which adapt iteratively to the dynamism inherent in production landscapes. This symbiosis underpins a more holistic, anticipatory decision-making process, empowering stakeholders to pinpoint and mitigate operational hiccups, optimize supply chain vectors, and streamline quality assurance protocols, thereby catalyzing a more resilient, responsive, and cost-effective production framework. Furthermore, we explore the ethical contours of data stewardship in this context, advocating for a judicious balance between technological ascendancy and responsible data governance. The culmination of this exploration is the conceptualization of a predictive, self-regulating production ecosystem that thrives on continuous learning and improvement, dynamically calibrating itself in response to an ever-evolving market tableau and thereby heralding a new era of optimal, sustainable, and intelligent production management. © 2023, Science and Information Organization.

In simple terms, a dataspace refers to an environment where data from various sources, formats, and domains can be integrated, shared, and analyzed. It aims to provide a unified view of heterogeneous data by bridging the gap between different data silos, enabling interoperability. The concept of dataspaces promotes the idea that data should be treated as a cohesive entity, rather than being fragmented across different systems and applications. Dataspaces often involve the integration of structured and unstructured data, including databases, documents, sensor data, social media feeds, and more. The goal is to enable organizations to harness the full potential of their data assets by facilitating data discovery, access, and analysis. By bringing together diverse data sources, dataspaces can offer new insights, support decision-making processes, and drive innovation. In the context of European Commission-funded research projects, dataspaces are often explored as part of initiatives focused on data management, data sharing, and the development of data-driven technologies. These projects aim to address challenges related to data integration, data privacy, data governance, and scalability. The goal is to advance the state of the art in data management and enable organizations to leverage data more effectively for societal, economic, and scientific advancements. It is important to notice that while dataspaces offer potential benefits, they also come with challenges. These challenges include data quality assurance, data privacy and security, semantic interoperability, scalability, and the need for appropriate data governance frameworks. Overall, dataspaces represent an approach to managing and utilizing data that emphasizes integration, interoperability, and accessibility. The concept is being explored and researched to develop innovative solutions that can unlock the value of data in various domains and sectors. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

Organizations can gain competitive advantage by being ahead of the curve in organizing data, deriving insights from it, and turning those insights into action. In practice, however, many organizations fail to meet this challenge. Far too many decisions are made without data, decision makers don't trust their own data. The data warehouse, later the data lake and more recently the data lakehouse have been propagated as solutions to these problems in recent decades. In some cases, this actually succeeds, in other cases challenges remain. The recently prominent data mesh approach changes the perspective on data and in this respect provides valuable impulses for data architectures in general. Data mesh is a new architectural concept for data management in organizations. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce this new data concept and provide a clear overview of the design of a data mesh architecture. We will then show how it can be technically implemented and what potential there is for using data mesh in organizations. Our methodology is a type of investigation that provides a helpful and practical guide to understanding the principles and patterns of data mesh and their implementation in organizations. Our research result has shown that the data mesh approach is therefore a very good tool for organizations where data sharing and reuse is crucial. In addition to facilitating scalability, data mesh can enable better data integration and data management, improving data quality while fostering a culture of data-driven decision-making. © © 2023 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Big Data; Data Discovery; Data Fabric; Data Lake; Data Lakehouse; Data Management; Data Mesh; Data Swamp; Data Warehouse; Decision Making","Big data; Competition; Data integration; Data mining; Data warehouses; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Lakes; Mesh generation; Competitive advantage; Data discovery; Data fabric; Data lake; Data lakehouse; Data mesh; Data swamp; Decisions makings; Digitisation; Mesh approach; Decision making","","","","","","","Antikainen, Maria J., Digitalisation as an Enabler of Circular Economy, Procedia CIRP, 73, pp. 45-49, (2018); Machado, Inês Araújo, Advancing Data Architectures with Data Mesh Implementations, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 452, pp. 10-18, (2022); Information Governance Principles and Practices for A Big Data Landscape, (2014); Black, Stuart, Data governance and the secondary use of data: The board influence, Information and Organization, 33, 2, (2023); Data Mesh Motivational Factors Challenges and Best Practices, (2023); Data Science Trends Perspectives and Prospects, (2021); Buer, Sven Vegard, The Data-Driven Process Improvement Cycle: Using Digitalization for Continuous Improvement, 51, 11, pp. 1035-1040, (2018); Buranarach, Marut, A scalable framework for creating open government data services from open government data catalog, 9th International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems, MEDES 2017, 2017-January, pp. 1-5, (2017); Butte, Vijay Kumar, Enterprise Data Strategy: A Decentralized Data Mesh Approach, 2022 International Conference on Data Analytics for Business and Industry, ICDABI 2022, pp. 62-66, (2022); Callegaro, Mario, Online Panel Research: A Data Quality Perspective, Online Panel Research: A Data Quality Perspective, pp. 1-477, (2014)","","Gruenwald, L.; Masciari, E.; Rolland, C.; Bernardino, J.","Science and Technology Publications, Lda","Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication (INSTICC)","15th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Information Systems, KMIS 2023 as part of the 15th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management, IC3K 2023","2023-11-13 through 2023-11-15","Hybrid, Rome","194821","","9789897586712; 9789897585333; 9789897586149; 9789897587160; 9789897587696","","","English","International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management, IC3K - Proceedings","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179764912"

However, traditional design strategies for this kind of applications require in the background well-defined and cleaned data structures. Conceptual modelling may be fruitfully employed to provide web developers with a comprehensive vision over Data Lake sources, on which web applications are designed. Nevertheless, the cumbersome nature of Data Lakes turns the conceptual model into a dynamic entity, which must be properly managed. In this paper, we propose a methodological approach to design data-intensive web applications on top of a Data Lake. A conceptual data model, weaved over Data Lake sources, is leveraged to identify the relevant information to be included in the web application. The methodology makes the model evolve both with new data sources content emerging from the Data Lake, through a zone-based operations pipeline that prepares a curated version of the raw data (bottom-up), and with additional domain knowledge provided by web developers derived from the data-intensive web application design (top-down). The approach, independent from any specific implementation technology, is declined in the context of a real case study regarding an ongoing research project in the cultural heritage domain. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","conceptual model; Data Lakes; Data-intensive web applications; methodological approach; zone-based architecture","Decision making; Design; Domain Knowledge; Conceptual model; Data lake; Data-intensive web applications; Methodological approach; WEB application; Web application design; Web applications; Web developers; Zone-based; Zone-based architecture; Lakes","","","","","","","Behehsti, Amin, CoreKG: A Knowledge lake service, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 11, 12, pp. 1942-1945, (2018); Designing Data Intensive Web Applications, (2002); Ciaccia, Paolo, Conceptual Constraints for Data Quality in Data Lakes, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 3340, pp. 111-122, (2022); Deligiannis, Kimon, Hydria: An online data lake for multi-faceted analytics in the cultural heritage domain, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 4, 2, pp. 1-28, (2020); Diamantini, Claudia, An Approach to Extracting Topic-guided Views from the Sources of a Data Lake, Information Systems Frontiers, 23, 1, pp. 243-262, (2021); Giebler, Corinna, A Zone Reference Model for Enterprise-Grade Data Lake Management, Proceedings - 2020 IEEE 24th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference, EDOC 2020, pp. 57-66, (2020); Hai, Rihan, Constance: An intelligent data lake system, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, 26-June-2016, pp. 2097-2100, (2016); undefined; Martinez-Prieto, Miguel A., Integrating flight-related information into a (Big) data lake, AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings, 2017-September, (2017); Ota, Masayo, Data-driven domain discovery for structured datasets, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 13, 7, pp. 953-965, (2020)","D.

Knowledge graphs are increasingly being established as a central data hub and prime source for BI and analytics. In the context of BI and analytics, KGs may be used for various analytical tasks; the integration of data and metadata in a KG potentially facilitates interpretation of analysis results. Knowledge Graph OLAP (KG-OLAP) adapts the concept of online analytical processing (OLAP) from multidimensional data analysis for the processing of KGs for analytical purposes. The current KG-OLAP implementation is a monolithic system, which greatly inhibits scalability. We propose a research plan for the development of a framework for distributed and parallel data processing for KG-OLAP over big data. In particular, we propose a framework for KG-OLAP over big data based on the data lakehouse architecture, which leverages existing frameworks for parallel and distributed data processing.

Microgrids support a low-carbon future, as these flexible, efficient, and localised electric grids enable the integration of the ever-growing deployment of distributed Renewable Energy Resources (RESs). Promoting sustainable power and demand side management, microgrids can strengthen grid resilience and help mitigate grid disturbances, as well as function as an auxiliary grid resource for faster system response and recovery. SEMS platforms have the ability to augment, in a coordinated manner, the contribution from RESs which can be inherently volatile in nature. Today's power supply network Model Predictive Control (MPC) systems heavily rely on 'big data' to deliver optimal schedules, whilst anticipating future behaviour and system deviations. As national and intercontinental grids become more complex and intertwined, petabyte data lakes are required to feed data-driven analytics to optimally control Energy Management Systems (EMSs). Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive review of Data-driven Energy Management Systems (DDEMS), focusing on their respective decision-making and forecasting techniques (point and interval) to augment the control of non-linear systems. Furthermore, the deterministic and probabilistic forecasting methods implemented within the governing algorithms to capture the uncertainties due to RES variability are examined. © 2023 IEEE.","data-driven microgrid; decision-making; deep learning and machine learning forecast; Microgrid; smart energy management system","Decision making; Deep learning; Electric power distribution; Electric power system control; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Forecasting; Information management; Learning systems; Linear systems; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Data driven; Data-driven microgrid; Decisions makings; Deep learning and machine learning forecast; Low-carbon futures; Machine-learning; Microgrid; Smart energies; Smart energy management system; Energy management systems","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (18/CRT/6222); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI","This publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland under Grant number 18/CRT/6222.","Ember Global Electricity Review, (2022); undefined, (2021); Cai, Liya, Pathways for electric power industry to achieve carbon emissions peak and carbon neutrality based on LEAP model: A case study of state-owned power generation enterprise in China, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 170, (2022); Sedhom, Bishoy E., IoT-based optimal demand side management and control scheme for smart microgrid, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 127, (2021); undefined, (2022); undefined, (2022); undefined, (2021); Wang, Yafei, Evaluation of economic benefits of virtual power plant between demand and plant sides based on cooperative game theory, Energy Conversion and Management, 238, (2021); Sheha, Moataz N., Techno-economic analysis of the impact of dynamic electricity prices on solar penetration in a smart grid environment with distributed energy storage, Applied Energy, 282, (2021); Carbon","","Sandikkaya, M.T.; Usta, O.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","EnerjiSA; IEEE PES; Omicron Bahrain; SEL","2023 IEEE PES Generation, Transmission and Distribution International Conference and Exposition, GTD 2023","2023-05-22 through 2023-05-25","Istanbul","193091","","9781728170251","","","English","Proc. - IEEE PES GTD Int.

This is common to most technical applications, but it is particularly true for the drilling operations, where considerable investments and associated risks are involved. During last years, as part of its digital transformation process, the operator has equipped itself with several digital tools for the diagnosis and the monitoring of drilling and completion operations. Goals and reached benefits can be summarized in risk reduction, operational efficiency and performance optimization. Based on an already wide case history started in 2019, a Digital Drilling Package was developed for operations support, from the design to the construction phase. Three main tools are now available to be applied to the most complex wells, either stand-alone or in parallel, covering Non-Productive Time (NPT) prediction, performance advanced analytics and drilling operations real time simulations. This last simulation tool has been deployed for the first time in 2021 on some wells in Africa and is now being included in the engineering and operation workflows. Attacking operational NPT and invisible lost time with the aim to increase safety and to reach the technical limit is not only a matter of processing tools. It requires a deep integration among headquarters, geographical units and field locations, with the definition of a strong data management infrastructure. This paper describes operator's experience both on-site and in office, showing how the portability and integration of big data systems, suitable data lake architectures and human factor synergies can create effectiveness at all levels. An Africa field case history will be reported to show how predictive and data analytics modelling and tools interact. In addition, the way in which these tools have been managed to support optimum decision-making processes will be also highlighted. Next development steps will target an even higher level of integration of all available digital tools in order to have a single diagnostic approach based on univocal dashboards and in-house data server infrastructures. © © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","","Data integration; Decision making; Digital devices; Infill drilling; Information management; Integration; Investments; Predictive analytics; Case history; Digital tools; Drilling operation; Key factors; Market uncertainty; Non-productive time; Operational excellence; Performance optimizations; Profit margin; Risks reduction; Data Analytics","","","","","","","Burrafato, Sebastiano, Digital disruption in drilling & completion operations, Offshore Mediterranean Conference and Exhibition 2019, OMC 2019, (2019); Cappuccio, Pasquale, Well construction process in a digital era: Data driven approach to support well operations, Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020, (2020); Mayani, Maryam Gholami, Advanced real-time monitoring provides early detection and prevention of costly well problems, SPE/IADC Drilling Conference, Proceedings, 2019-March, (2019); Rossi, Nicola, Big data for advanced well engineering holds strong potential to optimize drilling costs, JPT, Journal of Petroleum Technology, 70, 2, pp. 18-21, (2018); Zausa, Fabrizio, Multi source data analysis to improve drilling efficiency, reduce costs and enhance performance monitoring, Offshore Mediterranean Conference and Exhibition 2019, OMC 2019, (2019)","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)","","2023 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, ATCE 2023","2023-10-16 through 2023-10-18","San Antonio","193292","","9781555637446; 9781555631482; 9781555636524; 9781613996638; 9781613998595; 9781618392657; 9781613997239; 9781555636395; 9781634398879; 9781555631567","PSAEE","","English","Proc SPE Annu Tech Conf Exhib","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174490698"

Smart components of smart production continuously generate a very large amount of data, and all this data must considered when making management decisions, efficiently processed, and stored. At the same time, the article does not consider the essence of the structure of smart production management systems. It discusses an intelligent control system. The article also discusses the modern production experience of digital transformation. It also offers solutions for creating an efficient digital production infrastructure and decision support. Attention is focused on the information infrastructure of smart manufacturing, which allows you to take advantage of smart technologies such as big data, machine learning, and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT). At a base of the infrastructure for storing and processing information and knowledge, it is recommended to allocate a component for storing big data. As such a component, it would be most optimal to use a data lake.

These data are often dumped into a centralized repository, e.g., a data lake, consisting of thousands of structured and unstructured datasets. Perversely, such mixture makes the problem of discovering tables or documents that are relevant to a user’s query very challenging. Despite the recent efforts in data discovery, the problem remains widely open especially in the two fronts of (1) discovering relationships and relatedness across structured and unstructured datasets–where existing techniques suffer from either scalability, being customized for a specific problem type (e.g., entity matching or data integration), or demolishing the structural properties on its way, and (2) developing a holistic system for integrating various similarity measurements and sketches in an effective way to boost the discovery accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new data discovery system, named CMDL, for addressing these two limitations. CMDL supports the data discovery process over both structured and unstructured data while retaining the structural properties of tables. As a result, CMDL is the only system to date that empowers end-users to seamlessly pipeline the discovery tasks across the two modalities. We propose a novel multi-modal embedding representation that captures the similarities between text documents and tabular columns. The model training relies on labeled datasets generated though weak supervision, and thus the system is domain agnostic and easily generalizable. We evaluate CMDL on three real-world data lakes with diverse applications and show that our system is significantly more effective for cross-modality discovery compared to the search-based baseline techniques. Moreover, CMDL is more accurate and robust to different data types and distributions compared to the state-of-the-art systems that are limited to only the structured datasets. © 2023 VLDB Endowment.","","Data integration; Decision making; Modal analysis; Search engines; Structural properties; Centralised; Cross-modal; Data discovery; Data driven decision; Decisions makings; Large amounts of data; Modal data; Specific problems; Structured data; Unstructured data; Lakes","","","","","","Mayuresh Kunjir was employed at QCRI when this project was carried out.

Improved processes with better decision making are the actors that drive the evolution of tomorrow's services. This new technology has enabled innovations in several sectors including medical, manufacturing, automation, energy, education, and others. It should be noted that in recent years, Industry 4.0 and the COVID-19 sanitary crisis have forced some remarkable transformations and contributions to people's quality of life, safety, health and education. Currently, the education sector in all its levels (primary, secondary and university) re-quires the use of this technology and is moving more specifically towards a system known as ""education 4.0"" to meet the different demands of this sector. In this paper, we present a literature review of the use of Big Data analytics in the education sector in particular.

Furthermore, there is a need to reduce the gap on time from when information is created to when actions and insights can be offered. However, a challenge in implementing a large-scale data processing architecture is deciding which tools are appropriate, and how to apply them in the best way possible. For example, streaming systems are now mature enough that hospitals worldwide can use their extremely large datasets, along with data producers, to predict and influence future events. Thus, the main objective of this systematic review is to identify the state-of-the-art in data platforms on healthcare that allow the creation of metrics and actions in real-time. The PRISMA guideline for reporting systematic reviews was implemented to deliver a transparent and consistent report, validating the technological advances in a critical sector. Multiple pertinent articles and papers were retrieved from the SCOPUS abstract and citation database on May 13, 2022, using several relevant keywords to identify potentially relevant documents published from January 2020 onward. These documents must have already been published in English and been already published, and accessible through the B-ON consortium that allows Portuguese students to legally download from most publishers. Over seven studies have been selected for deeper discussion based on their relevance and impact for this review, showcasing their main objectives, data sources, and tools used, as well as their approaches for interoperability and support of machine learning algorithms for decision support. In closing, the collected articles have shown that while Big Data is currently in use at health institutions of all sizes, the ability of processing large amounts of data from sensors and events, and notifying stakeholders as quickly as possible is still in its infancy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

The traditional approach adopted by these systems, are based on common architectures represented in most of the time by the data warehouses. These works with relational database systems supporting data of structured type as well. However, the decision-making process is often not limited to structured data. Indeed, with the emergence of Big Data, the value of data can also be extracted from massive data sources containing data of diverse types, structured, semi-structured and unstructured. As a result, NoSQL systems have been integrated into the architecture of decision support system, in parallel with data warehouses, in order to overcome their limitations regarding Big Data characteristics. In this sense, this article presents a synthetic literature review on the work done in recent years, treating the hybridization of traditional systems with NoSQL databases, including relational databases and traditional data warehouses. We aim by this work to scheme the limits of the existing approaches and to determine the most fitting characteristics for the design of a hybrid architecture suitable for the migration of companies to Big Data architectures.

However, if proper data management concerns are not addressed, this massive data storage can easily turn Data Lakes into Data Swamps. Furthermore, data must be associated with the data artefacts created to extract value from it, such as pipelines used to collect, treat, or process data and analytical artefacts such as analytical dashboards and machine learning models. This paper proposes a more comprehensive view of a Data Lake, in which all of these resources can be stored and managed. To that end, the conceptual meta-model incorporates a data catalog, data at various stages of maturity, pipelines, dashboards, and machine learning models. The proposed meta-model was instantiated in the ADM.IN (Advanced Decision Making in Productive Systems through Intelligent Networks) project, showing how vast amounts of data and their related artefacts can be managed to support decision-making processes with data analytics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big Data Analytics; Data Lake; Productive Systems","Big data; Decision making; Digital storage; Information management; Lakes; Machine learning; Metadata; Pipelines; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Data artifacts; Data lake; Decisions makings; Formalisation; Machine learning models; Meta model; Metamodeling; Productive systems; Data Analytics","","","","","(055087, POCI-01-0247-FEDER-055087); (101070186); Australian Government; Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics, North Carolina State University, CDP, (881843); Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics, North Carolina State University, CDP; European Research Council, ERC, (20203FFYLK, 834228); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (277991500, 432399058, 445156547); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (16-IDEX-0001); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; University of Wollongong, UOW; University of Adelaide; University of South Australia, UniSA; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/00319/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Generalitat Valenciana, GVA; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2020-117191RBI00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PROMETEO/2021/088); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; European Social Fund Plus, ESF; Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG; Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, MiSE, (F/160038/01-04/X41); Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, MiSE; Programa Operacional Temático Factores de Competitividade, POFC; Conselleria de Innovación, Universidades, Ciencia y Sociedad Digital, Generalitat Valenciana, CIUCSD","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements.

As one of the businesses with an ecosystem that contributes to data growth, banks have challenges in generating insight. A high level of data security is frequently linked to a high level of data access difficulties. This poses a challenge to the implementation of data-driven business, where taking control of our data is one of the best ways to ensure that we not only own data but also have the ability to process and use data to extract business value. Through literature review, a number of challenges to optimizing the implementation of big data analytics in the banking industry were discovered. Data governance refers to the methods and procedures that assist banks in managing and securing data. A big data architecture is presented to address the highlighted issues, particularly with a multi-tiered approach to big data structures. With the adoption of this architecture, it will be simpler to generate business-value-generating insights for the banking industry using big data with accessibility and protection of data. © 2023 IEEE.","bank; big data; big data architecture; business value; data governance; data-driven","Advanced Analytics; Data Analytics; Decision making; Banking industry; Big data architecture; Business architecture; Business value; Data architectures; Data driven; Data governances; Data implementation; Exponential growth; Systematic Review; Big data","","","","","","","Yildirim, Mustafa, Big data analytics for default prediction using graph theory, Expert Systems with Applications, 176, (2021); Wong, Kayee, Big data quality prediction informed by banking regulation, International Journal of Data Science and Analytics, 12, 2, pp. 147-164, (2021); Maja, Mogabe Marcia, Towards a data-driven technology roadmap for the bank of the future: Exploring big data analytics to support technology roadmapping, Social Sciences and Humanities Open, 6, 1, (2022); Fosso-Wamba, Samuel Fasso, How 'big data' can make big impact: Findings from a systematic review and a longitudinal case study, International Journal of Production Economics, 165, pp. 234-246, (2015); Saggi, Mandeep Kaur, A survey towards an integration of big data analytics to big insights for value-creation, Information Processing and Management, 54, 5, pp. 758-790, (2018); Mikalef, Patrick, Big data analytics capability: Antecedents and business value, Proceedings ot the 21st Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: ''Societal Transformation Through IS/IT'', PACIS 2017, (2017); van Rijmenam, Mark, Avoid being the Turkey: How big data analytics changes the game of strategy in times of ambiguity and uncertainty, Long Range Planning, 52, 5, (2019); Journal of Software Engineering, (2015); Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, (2007); Mikalef, Patrick, Big data analytics and firm performance: Findings from a mixed-method approach, Journal of Business Research, 98, pp. 261-276, (2019)","I.

The solution to this problem is digital twins based on data lake technology implementation. The aim of the work is to create a prototype of an electronic passport (e-passport) of materials as the basis of their digital twin. The digital twin is to contain a set of data on the composition, structure, calculated and experimentally measured properties, participation in the composition of chemical reactions, constructed models and ""structure-property""patterns as well. It is proposed to combine the information on a specific material or compound into an information structure-electronic passports of the research object. At the same time, it is advisable to consider the electronic passport as a comprehensive description of the object, including information about the static and dynamic parameters of the atomic-molecular system of the research object. The e-passport as an information object gives a systematic data on the composition of a substance, structure, calculated and experimentally measured properties, the participation of elements in the composition of chemical reactions, constructed models and ""structure-property""patterns, thus acting as a generalizing tool convenient for users to present information available in the database of digital twins of materials. © 2023 IEEE.","big data; data lake; decision support system; digital twin; electronic passport; full-Text search","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Lakes; Search engines; Structure (composition); Data lake; Electronic passports; Full-text search; Measured properties; Object description; Property patterns; Research object; Structure property; System development; Technology implementation; Decision support systems","","","","","","","Ernst Young Global Limited, (2021); Glatt, Moritz F., Modeling and implementation of a digital twin of material flows based on physics simulation, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 58, pp. 231-245, (2021); Xiang, Feng, Digital twin driven green material optimal-selection towards sustainable manufacturing, Procedia CIRP, 81, pp. 1290-1294, (2019); 4th International Congress on 3D Material Science, (2018); Kalidindi, Surya R., Digital Twins for Materials, Frontiers in Materials, 9, (2022); Information Management Systems, (2015); Business Analytics from Data to Knowledge, (2013); Data Lake for Enterprises Lambda Architecture for Building Enterprise Data Systems, (2017); Itm Web Conf, (2018); Corporate Data Warehouses Planning Development Implementation, (2001)","D.

This has motivated different companies and organizations to adapt and update their information systems, technology and data architectures in order to improve the extraction of added value for decision making by varying the integration of multiple data sources for advanced analysis and to meet analytical and reporting needs. Today with the explosion of data in the world of big data and the challenges and pain point faced by businesses to fulfill strategic requirements and to make the right decision The ability to analyze available of this data is a valuable asset for any successful business, especially when the analysis is based on data from multiple data sources and enriched by a flexible integration to answer business KPIs based on predefined objectives. To address this issue of analysis complexity and sometimes lack of data we provide a vision and implementation of a new architecture that covers the entire data life-cycle and leverages new big data technologies with classic DW capabilities in order to increase the Big DW based on the combination of data from internal DW and external DW fed by an external data model on demand. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big Data; Business KPI; ETL.Big Data; LOD; MapReduce; OpenData; Spark; Sqoop Data warehouse","Computer architecture; Data Analytics; Data integration; Data warehouses; Decision making; Life cycle; Network architecture; Open Data; Social sciences computing; Business KPI; Data architectures; Digital datas; ETL.; Information system architecture; LOD; Map-reduce; Multiple data sources; Opendata; Sqoop data warehouse; MapReduce","","","","","","","Gallinucci, Enrico, Interactive multidimensional modeling of linked data for exploratory OLAP, Information Systems, 77, pp. 86-104, (2018); Rizzi, Stefano, Towards exploratory OLAP on linked data, Proceedings of the 24th Italian Symposium on Advanced Database Systems, SEBD 2016, pp. 86-93, (2016); DOLAP, (2019); undefined; Berkani, Nabila, The contribution of linked open data to augment a traditional data warehouse, Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 55, 3, pp. 397-421, (2020); undefined; 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power Supplies º in 2021 23rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Zdravevski, Eftim, Row Key Designs of NoSQL Database Tables and Their Impact on Write Performance, Proceedings - 24th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing, PDP 2016, pp. 10-17, (2016); undefined; Herodotou, Herodotos, No one (cluster) size fits all: Automatic cluster sizing for data-intensive analytics, Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing, SOCC 2011, (2011)","A.

Further, the decision-making process for a suitable data storage system is discussed. LCA requires a lot of relevant data such as resource/material data, production process data and logistics data, originating from many different sources, which must be integrated. Therefore, data collection for LCA is quite difficult. In practice, relevant data for LCA is often not available or is uncertain and has therefore to be estimated or generalized. This implies less accuracy of the calculated carbon footprint. State of the Art research shows that the LCA data collection process can benefit from data engineering approaches. Key of these approaches is a suitable and efficient data storage system like a data warehouse or a data lake. Depending on the LCA use case, a data storage system can also benefit from the combination with other technologies such as big data and cloud computing. As a result, in this paper a criteria catalog is developed and presented. It can be used to evaluate and decide which data storage systems and additional technologies are recommended to store and process data for more efficient and more precise carbon footprint calculation in life cycle assessment. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Carbon footprint; Data engineering; Data storage technology; Life cycle assessment","Data acquisition; Data warehouses; Decision making; Digital storage; Emission control; Life cycle; Centralised; Data engineering; Data production; Data storage systems; Data storage technology; Decision-making process; Life cycle assessment; Material data; Process data; Resource materials; Carbon footprint","","","","","Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG; Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie, BMVIT; Bundesministerium für Digitalisierung und Wirtschaftsstandort, BMDW","Acknowledgments.

Data sources produce massive and complex data, which makes knowledge extraction with traditional tools difficult for educational organizations. Indeed, the actual architecture of data warehouses do not possess the capability of storing and managing this huge amount of varied data. The same goes for analytical processes; which no longer satisfy business analysts; in terms of data availability and speed of execution of queries. These constraints have implied an evolution towards more modern architectures, integrating Big Data solutions capable of promoting smart learning to students. In this context, the present paper proposes a new big data architecture for education systems covering multiple data sources. Using this architecture, data is organized through a set of layers, starting with the management of the different data sources to their final consumption. The proposal approach includes data lake as a means of modernizing decision-making processes, in particular data warehouses and OLAP methods. It will be used as a means for data consolidation for the integration of heterogeneous data sources. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big Data Architecture; Data lake; Data warehouse; Education systems","Big data; Data integration; Decision making; Lakes; Big data architecture; Complex data; Data architectures; Data lake; Data volume; Data-source; Education systems; Educational organizations; Knowledge extraction; Massive data; Data warehouses","","","","","","","Janev, Valentina I., Semantic intelligence in big data applications, Smart Connected World: Technologies and Applications Shaping the Future, pp. 71-89, (2021); Bimonte, Sandro, Design and implementation of active stream data warehouses, Research Anthology on Decision Support Systems and Decision Management in Healthcare, Business, and Engineering, pp. 288-311, (2021); Xu, Lida, Big data for cyber physical systems in industry 4.0: a survey, Enterprise Information Systems, 13, 2, pp. 148-169, (2019); Cebrián, Gisela, The smart classroom as a means to the development of ESD methodologies, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 7, (2020); Science and World International Scientific Journal, (2020); Jha, Sanjay, A Step towards Big Data Architecture for Higher Education Analytics, Proceedings - 2018 5th Asia-Pacific World Congress on Computer Science and Engineering, APWC on CSE 2018, pp. 178-183, (2018); Ijaz Baig, Maria, Big data in education: a state of the art, limitations, and future research directions, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, (2020); E Business Technologies Conference Proceedings Vol 1 no 1 Pp 4448, (2021); Wibowo, Merlinda, Machine learning in data lake for combining data silos, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 10387 LNCS, pp. 294-306, (2017); International Journal of Database Management Systems, (2019)","L.

This is common to most technical applications, but it is particularly true for the drilling operations, where considerable investments and associated risks are involved. During last years, as part of its digital transformation process, the operator has equipped itself with several digital tools for the diagnosis and the monitoring of drilling and completion operations. Goals and reached benefits can be summarized in risk reduction, operational efficiency and performance optimization. Based on an already wide case history started in 2019, a Digital Drilling Package was developed for operations support, from the design to the construction phase. Three main tools are now available to be applied to the most complex wells, either stand-alone or in parallel, covering Non-Productive Time (NPT) prediction, performance advanced analytics and drilling operations real time simulations. This last simulation tool has been deployed for the first time in 2021 on some wells in Africa and is now being included in the engineering and operation workflows. Attacking operational NPT and invisible lost time with the aim to increase safety and to reach the technical limit is not only a matter of processing tools. It requires a deep integration among headquarters, geographical units and field locations, with the definition of a strong data management infrastructure. This paper describes operator’s experience both on-site and in office, showing how the portability and integration of big data systems, suitable data lake architectures and human factor synergies can create effectiveness at all levels. An Africa field case history will be reported to show how predictive and data analytics modelling and tools interact. In addition, the way in which these tools have been managed to support optimum decision-making processes will be also highlighted. Next development steps will target an even higher level of integration of all available digital tools in order to have a single diagnostic approach based on univocal dashboards and in-house data server infrastructures. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","","Big data; Data integration; Decision making; Digital devices; Gasoline; Infill drilling; Information management; Integration; Investments; Petroleum engineering; Well drilling; Case history; Digital tools; Drilling operation; Key factors; Market uncertainty; Non-productive time; Operational excellence; Performance optimizations; Profit margin; Risks reduction; Predictive analytics","","","","","","","Burrafato, Sebastiano, Digital disruption in drilling & completion operations, Offshore Mediterranean Conference and Exhibition 2019, OMC 2019, (2019); Cappuccio, Pasquale, Well construction process in a digital era: Data driven approach to support well operations, Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020, (2020); Mayani, Maryam Gholami, Advanced real-time monitoring provides early detection and prevention of costly well problems, SPE/IADC Drilling Conference, Proceedings, 2019-March, (2019); Rossi, Nicola, Big data for advanced well engineering holds strong potential to optimize drilling costs, JPT, Journal of Petroleum Technology, 70, 2, pp. 18-21, (2018); Zausa, Fabrizio, Multi source data analysis to improve drilling efficiency, reduce costs and enhance performance monitoring, Offshore Mediterranean Conference and Exhibition 2019, OMC 2019, (2019)","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)","","2023 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, ATCE 2023","2023-10-16 through 2023-10-18","San Antonio","213274","","9781613999929","","","English","SPE Annu.

As the power marketing decision-making system involves more data, there are often some cases of incomplete data collection and incorrect data analysis results in the system, and through the advantages of resources in the era of big data, power companies can focus on developing power system integration, centralised management of resources and big data decision support. In the process of data integration, the power grid company has developed a large number of information systems, but still lacks some practical enterprise decision-making systems. The so-called enterprise decision-making system is a decision-making system that facilitates customer service, improves efficiency and saves labour costs. This paper uses data warehousing and data mining technology to propose the development and design of a power marketing decision support system based on data mining technology, and designs the business architecture, application architecture, data architecture and technical architecture based on the results of requirement analysis. Through practice, it is shown that the system has strong management, decision-making and query capabilities, fast response speed and relatively simple operation, which can provide comprehensive information support for high-level marketing decisions and improve enterprise competitiveness and economic benefits. © 2022 ACM.","Customer Service; Data Mining Technology; Enterprise Decision-Making; Power Marketing; System Optimization","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Competition; Computer architecture; Data acquisition; Data integration; Data mining; Data warehouses; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information management; Marketing; Search engines; 'current; Customer-service; Data mining technology; Decision-making systems; Electric power; Enterprise decision-making; Marketing decision; Optimization design; Power marketing; System optimizations; Big data","","","","","","","Qin, Yunfei, Implementation and design of basketball technical action based on B/S framework data mining system, Applied Mechanics and Materials, 380-384, pp. 2736-2740, (2013); Cheng, Wenyuan, Composite structure optimization design system based on grid technology, Key Engineering Materials, 334-335 I, pp. 453-456, (2007); Jiang, Li, Optimization design for a high voltage DC power supply module based on PSM technology, Plasma Science and Technology, 16, 4, pp. 424-428, (2014); Ge, Lianzheng, Optimization design of drive system for industrial robots based on dynamic performance, Industrial Robot, 44, 6, pp. 765-775, (2017); Li, Xinwang, The shift step optimization of belt conveyor in self-advancing semi-continuous mining technology based on SIMIO, World Journal of Engineering, 14, 4, pp. 324-328, (2017); Xue, Puning, Fault detection and operation optimization in district heating substations based on data mining techniques, Applied Energy, 205, pp. 926-940, (2017); Fei, Xianju, Research on data mining algorithm based on neural network and particle swarm optimization, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 35, 3, pp. 2921-2926, (2018); Circuits and Systems, (2012); Sun, Jiwen, Design for diagnosability of multistation manufacturing systems based on sensor allocation optimization, Computers in Industry, 60, 7, pp. 501-509, (2009); Gu, Qiang, Development of materials database system for cae system of heat treatment based on data mining technology, Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China (English Edition), 16, SUPPL., pp. s572-s576, (2006)","M.

But the issue of managing and storing these data collected has been the major issue faced by enterprises at all levels. The emergence of data warehouses and enterprise data lakes has helped resolve the issue of dealing with data silos and deriving value from the unlimited size and data types. Data lakes not only provide various technological benefits but also democratize data with better scalability and versatility. Unlike data warehousing, a data lake helps in real-time decision analytics and provides more ways to analyze data. This paper focuses on the important role enterprise Data Lake plays today to overcome big data challenges and drive this digital transformation era and how building an enterprise data lake can transform the business paradigm. It also discusses the market overview and growth of data lakes with the future scope and the challenges and opportunities arising with the growth of enterprise data lakes. © 2022 Author(s).","analytics; business; data; Data Lake; data silos; decision; digital; Enterprise; transformation","","","","","","","","Data Lakes and the Data Lake Market the What Why and how; Global Data Lakes Market by Component by End Use Industry by Geographic Scope and Forecast, (2019); Data Lake Market Size Share Trends Analysis Report by Type Solution Services by Deployment Cloud on Premise by Vertical IT Bfsi Retail Healthcare by Region and Segment Forecasts 2020 2027, (2020); Enterprise Big Data Lake Delivering the Promise of Big Data and Data Science, (2019); Enterprise Data Lake Architecture What to Consider When Designing; Hybrid Enterprise Data Lakes Provide Foundation for Disruptive Business Intelligence, (2017); Constance an Intelligent Data Lake System, (2016); Data Lake A New Ideology in Big Data Era, (2020); Quantum Dot Cellular Automata Based Digital Logic Circuits A Design Perspective, (2020); Big Data Fast Data and Data Lake Concepts, (2016)","S.

A need to collect and analyze data from different sources has emerged. At the same time, traditional decision support systems are unable to meet the growing needs of modern businesses to integrate and analyze a wide variety of generated data. As a result, most organizations need to convert their data stored in relational systems to NoSQL or ""Not only SQL"" systems that are based on flexible models and schemas. Our work is part of a medical application that must allow health professionals to analyze complex data for decision making. We propose mechanisms to extract data from a Data Lake and store them in a NoSQL Data Warehouse. This will allow to perform, in a second time, decisional analysis facilitated by the features offered by NoSQL systems (richness of data structures, query language, access performances). In this article, we present a process for ingesting data from a Data Lake into a Data Warehouse. The ingestion consists, first, in transferring relational and NoSQL DBs extracted from the Data Lake into a single NoSQL DB (the Data Warehouse), second, in merging so-called ""similar"" classes and third, in converting the links into references between objects. To automate this process, we used the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) which provides a schema transformation environment. From the physical schemas describing a Data Lake, we propose transformation rules that allow to create a Data Warehouse stored under a document-oriented NoSQL system. An experimentation has been performed for a medical application. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Big Data; Data Lake; Data Warehouse; MDA; NoSQL; QVT; Relational databases","","","","","","","","Colleoni Couto, Julia Colleoni, A mapping study about data lakes: An improved definition and possible architectures, Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, SEKE, 2019-July, pp. 453-458, (2019); undefined; Kuszera, Evandro Miguel, Toward RDB to NoSQL: Transforming data with metamorfose framework, Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, Part F147772, pp. 456-463, (2019); Al Nahrain J Eng Sci, (2018); Stǎnescu, Liana Ionela, Automatic mapping of MySQL databases to NoSQL MongoDB, Proceedings of the 2016 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, FedCSIS 2016, pp. 837-840, (2016); Liyanaarachchi, Gayan, MigDB - Relational to NoSQL mapper, 2016 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability: Interoperable Sustainable Smart Systems for Next Generation, ICIAfS 2016, (2016); Mallek, Hana, BigDimETL with NoSQL Database, Procedia Computer Science, 126, pp. 798-807, (2018); Yangui, Rania, ETL based framework for NoSQL warehousing, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 299, pp. 40-53, (2017); Wijaya, Yansyah Saputra, A Framework for Data Migration between Different Datastore of NoSQL Database, Proceeding - 2018 International Conference on ICT for Smart Society: Innovation Toward Smart Society and Society 5.0, ICISS 2018, (2018); International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications, (2021)","R.

Their sustainability relies on efficient grazing management, especially in Mediterranean rangelands. The diversity of pastoral resources, combined with the variety of grazing management techniques and farming objectives, has slowed down the development of digital tools to assist grazing management in these conditions. However, digital technologies could serve agro-sylvo-pastoral farms by improving the efficiency of grazing management and reducing the difficulty of the associated work. In this objective, and to take into account the variety of situations, we suggest developing an information system (IS) based on a variety of (contextualised) complementary data. For southern France, the following data can be combined: Sentinel 2 images, Registre Parcellaire Graphique (RPG), OSO land use and cover, RGE Alti altimetry data, pastoral technical references, herd GPS location and feedback from farmers. However, designing and implementing such an IS requires overcoming methodological and technical limitations concerning the integration of heterogeneous structured and unstructured data and the definition of meaningful ways to combine them to produce relevant insights for decision-making. In this article, we describe an approach to produce a spatialised IS aimed at providing farmers with relevant information to support decisions regarding grazing management in mountainous and Mediterranean rangelands. The IS was codesigned with stakeholders, including farmers, to best match their needs and to facilitate its integration into farm management. The various stakeholders were involved in choosing the types of data to be associated and, defining the functions and the conceptual model of the IS. We propose to structure the IS as a spatial data lake, designed to integrate and associate the identified heterogeneous data, and to produce decision-making insights for grazing management in mountainous and Mediterranean rangelands. © 2022","Agro-sylvo-pastoral system; Decision-making; Heterogeneous data; Spatial data lake","Digital devices; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Lakes; Land use; Agro-sylvo-pastoral system; Decisions makings; Good and services; Grazing management; Heterogeneous data; Local populations; Management techniques; Mediterranean basin; Spatial data; Spatial data lake; Decision making; data set; decision making; GPS; grazing management; land cover; land use; satellite imagery; Sentinel; France; Mediterranean Sea","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-16-CONV-0004)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the French National Research Agency under the Investments for the Future Program, referred as ANR-16-CONV-0004.

In conjunction with machine learning, farmers can use data to address problems such as farmers’ decision making, water management, soil management, crop management, and livestock management. Crop management includes yield prediction, disease detection, weed detection, crop quality, and species recognition. On the other hand, livestock management considers animal welfare and livestock production. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the evidence regarding the challenges involved in implementing machine learning in agricultural Big Data. We conducted a systematic literature review applying the PRISMA protocol. This review includes 30 papers published from 2015 to 2020.

The construction of a new-type power system at the industrial park level is the first demonstration of the coordinated optimization and intelligent control of power sources, grid, load, and energy storage to make overall planning to achieve diversified development. To sustain the 'balance, security, diversity, and low cost' construction goals of the new-type power system at the park level, the power grid dispatching and control system is transformed to the direction of intelligence and automation, which is reflected in the rapid emergence and construction of complex systems such as digital twin, simulation, reinforcement learning, model training and prediction, and intelligent decision-making of the EMS (Energy Manage System). This brings more complex data sharing, interaction, construction, and other technical requirements than ever before. At the same time, along with the simultaneous construction of new power systems such as micro-grids, virtual power plants, and distributed photovoltaic systems, it has exacerbated the problems of data divergence from business, low data utilization, and centralized architecture brought by the data lakes and data warehouses under the previous monolithic architecture, leading to the data model hard to deploy to meet the demand for efficient collection, interaction, and sharing of scattered and heterogeneous data under the new generation energy structure and greatly increases the work pressure of the data team, making the data team a bottleneck for business applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel design scheme of data processing framework with the data mesh concept, supports the federal computing and analysis engine by building a distributed metadata center, changes the previous centralized data modeling method through data service and productization, realizes data sharing and interaction between complex multi-systems by defining service invocation and encapsulation technology means, improves data utilization, and better supports the automation, rationalization, and balanced construction of the intelligent dispatch system to meet the challenges and requirements brought by the new-type park-level power system. © 2022 IEEE.","data mesh; dispatching system; interaction; metadata","Carbon; Costs; Data warehouses; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric load dispatching; Electric power system control; Energy management systems; Mesh generation; Parks; Reinforcement learning; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Structural design; Carbon carbons; Carbon peaks; Data mesh; Data Sharing; Data utilization; Dispatching systems; Interaction; Novel design; Power; Renewable energies; Metadata","","","","","","","Zheng, Huanyu, The evolution of renewable energy and its impact on carbon reduction in China, Energy, 237, (2021); Zhao, Changying, China’s energy transitions for carbon neutrality: challenges and opportunities, Carbon Neutrality, 1, 1, (2022); Liu, Changyi, Building a New-Type Power System to Promote Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in the Power Industry in China, Chinese Journal of Urban and Environmental Studies, 10, 2, (2022); Cai, Zhi, Future power grid dispatch and control mode with large-scale clean energy integration in China, Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC, 2016-December, pp. 1749-1754, (2016); Rathor, Sumit K., Energy management system for smart grid: An overview and key issues, International Journal of Energy Research, 44, 6, pp. 4067-4109, (2020); Gräsberg, L., SCADA EMS DMS - A part of the corporate IT system, IEEE Power Industry Computer Applications Conference, pp. 141-147, (2001); Xu, Zun, Research and design of energy data acquisition system in electric porcelain enterprises, Proceedings of 2019 IEEE 3rd Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, ITNEC 2019, pp. 875-878, (2019); Fajjari, Ilhem, Cloud edge computing in the IoT, Annales des Telecommunications/Annals of Telecommunications, 73, 7-8, pp. 413-414, (2018); Data Warehouse Toolkit the Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling, (2013); undefined","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Computer Society; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; University of Stavanger","6th IEEE International Conference on Energy Internet, ICEI 2022","2022-12-28 through 2022-12-29","Virtual, Online","187925","","9781665493277","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

We assume that the combination of a data lake as a data repository and a data wrangling process should allow low-quality or ""bad"" data to be identified and eliminated, leaving only high-quality data, referred to as ""research information"" in the Research Information System (RIS) domain, allowing for the most accurate insights gained on their basis. This, however, would lead to increased value of both the data themselves and data-driven actions contributing to more accurate and aware decision-making. This cleansed research information is then entered into the appropriate target Current Research Information System (CRIS) so that it can be used for further data processing steps. In order to minimize the effort for the analysis, the proliferation and enrichment of large amounts of data and metadata, as well as to achieve far-reaching added value in information retrieval for CRIS employees, developers and end users, this paper outlines the concept of a curated data lake with the data wrangling process, showing how it can be used in CRIS to clean up data from heterogeneous data sources during their collection and integration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

Embedding medical knowledge graphs into low-dimensional vectors to implement certain applications is the focus of recent research. However, current approaches focus on using structured data while ignoring external information from prior knowledge and multi-modal data, such as visual and textual data. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal knowledge graph platform based on medical data lake. It enhances Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) from structural data by using prior knowledge like doctors’ advice. After the generation of embedding of knowledge graphs, we use a fully-connected layer to combine the structural vectors and multi-modal embedding from unstructured data for link prediction. Moreover, we provide recommendations to help doctors diagnose and research based on the knowledge graph embedding model. Our platform has been used in a clinical decision support system, which is capable of discovering unveiled relations between entities and giving suitable advice for doctors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Knowledge graph; Medical data lake; Multi-modal data","Decision support systems; Graph embeddings; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Modal analysis; Embeddings; Knowledge graphs; Medical data; Medical data lake; Medical domains; Medical knowledge; Multi-modal; Multi-modal data; Prior-knowledge; Lakes","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020AAA0109603); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China(2020AAA0109603).","Bordes, Antoine, Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2013); Springer New York Inc, (2014); Open Source Semantic Toolkit for Managing and Querying Knowledge Graphs, (2017); Ding, Boyang, Improving knowledge graph embedding using simple constraints, ACL 2018 - 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference (Long Papers), 1, pp. 110-121, (2018); Guo, Shu, Jointly embedding knowledge graphs and logical rules, EMNLP 2016 - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings, pp. 192-202, (2016); Ji, Guoliang, Knowledge graph embedding via dynamic mapping matrix, ACL-IJCNLP 2015 - 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference, 1, pp. 687-696, (2015); Kejriwal, Mayank, myDIG: Personalized illicit domain-specific knowledge discovery with no programming, Future Internet, 11, 3, (2019); Koren, Yehuda, Matrix factorization techniques for recommender systems, Computer, 42, 8, pp. 30-37, (2009); Lin, Hailun, Learning Entity and Relation Embeddings for Knowledge Resolution, Procedia Computer Science, 108, pp. 345-354, (2017); International Conference on Smart Health, (2016)","R.

The method uses open-source big data technology frameworks such as Kafka, Flink, Elasticsearch, etc. to complete the collection, analysis, storage and visual display of massive power mobile application data, and improve the throughput of data processing. The security situation awareness method of power mobile application takes the mobile terminal threat index as the core, divides the risk level for the mobile terminal, and predicts the terminal threat index through support vector machine regression algorithm (SVR), so as to construct the security profile of the mobile application operation terminal. Finally, through visualization services, various data such as power mobile applications and terminal assets, security operation statistics, security strategies, and alarm analysis are displayed to guide security operation and maintenance personnel to carry out power mobile application security monitoring and early warning, banning disposal and traceability analysis and other decision-making work. The experimental analysis results show that the method can meet the requirements of security situation awareness for threat assessment accuracy and response speed, and the related results have been well applied in a power company. © 2022 IEEE.","big data architecture; component;situational awareness; power mobile application; SVR; terminal threat index","Computer terminals; Data handling; Data visualization; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric utilities; Mobile computing; Support vector machines; Big data architecture; Component;; Data architectures; Mobile applications; Power; Power mobile application; Security situation; Situational awareness; SVR; Terminal threat index; Big data","","","","","State Grid Corporation of China, SGCC, (5700-202158183A-0-0-00); State Grid Corporation of China, SGCC","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by the science and technology project of State Grid Corporation of China: ""Research on Dynamic Access Authentication and Trust Evaluation Technology of Power Mobile Internet Services Based on Zero Trust"" (Grand No. 5700-202158183A-0-0-00).","Information Security Technology Baseline for Classified Protection of Cybersecurity S; Gong, Jian, Survey of Network Security Situation Awareness, Ruan Jian Xue Bao/Journal of Software, 28, 4, pp. 1010-1026, (2017); Computer Science, (2020); Kou, Guang, Research on key technologies of network security situational awareness for attack tracking prediction, Chinese Journal of Electronics, 28, 1, pp. 162-171, (2019); Dietterich, Thomas G., Machine learning methods for high level cyber situation awareness, Advances in Information Security, 46, pp. 227-247, (2010); Dapoigny, Richard, Formal foundations for situation awareness based on dependent type theory, Information Fusion, 14, 1, pp. 87-107, (2013); Ding, Huadong, Network security situation awareness model based on Bayesian method, Jisuanji Gongcheng/Computer Engineering, 46, 6, pp. 130-135, (2020); Xi, Rongrong, An improved quantitative evaluation method for network security, Jisuanji Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Computers, 38, 4, pp. 749-758, (2015); Research on Network Security Situation Awareness Based on Data Mining, (2019); Research and Application of Attack Modeling in the Mobile Internet, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas Manila; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; The International Society for Applied Computing (ISAC)","5th International Conference on Data Science and Information Technology, DSIT 2022","2022-07-22 through 2022-07-24","Shanghai","184487","","9781665498685","","","English","Int.

Building on an industry data-driven framework, this study strives to understand the state of implementing big data in the Indonesian banking sector. A deductively organized descriptive method employing in-depth interviews was conducted with subject matter experts representing Indonesian banking-related areas. The result and the following analysis show the modest status of big data implementation across three major banks and two complementary companies, as indicated by many elements of the framework phases that were found during the early adoption stage. This denotes a steady buy-in across banking business processes as particularly reflected in the framework’s four phases – continuing push to meet the variety aspect (intelligence), structured data architecture domination (design), limited choice of performance indicator for big data value (choice), and customer–corporate vision decoupling (implementation). While Indonesian banks have evidently initiated the big data implementation, further improvement remains imperative for the decision-making process. Accordingly, big data should be tightly coupled with a strong data-driven vision that drives decision-making across intra-firm actors. Handling data omnipresence shall be viewed as the embodiment of a data-driven vision. © Hamzah Ritchi, Gina Andriani, Reza Zulkarnaen, Akmal Zaidaan, 2022.","banking; big data; data-driven; decision making; framework; interview","","","","","","","","Adrian, Cecilia, Factors influencing to the implementation success of big data analytics: A systematic literature review, International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems, ICRIIS, (2017); Benue State University, (2017); Cuartas-Arias, Mauricio, Big data for use in psychological research, International Journal of Psychological Research, 10, 1, pp. 6-7, (2017); Azungah, Theophilus, Qualitative research: deductive and inductive approaches to data analysis, Qualitative Research Journal, 18, 4, pp. 383-400, (2018); Making Big Data Work in Retail Banking, (2015); Proceedings of the Southern Association for Information Systems Conference, (2014); Boddy, Clive R.P., Sample size for qualitative research, Qualitative Market Research, 19, 4, pp. 426-432, (2016); Data Driven Decision Making in Action, (2017); Cappa, Francesco, Big Data for Creating and Capturing Value in the Digitalized Environment: Unpacking the Effects of Volume, Variety, and Veracity on Firm Performance*, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 38, 1, pp. 49-67, (2021); undefined, (2014)","","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","18167403","","","","English","Banks Bank Syst.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141739268"

This will allow us to perform, in a second time, decisional analysis facilitated by the features offered by NoSQL systems (richness of data structures, query language, access performances). In this paper, we present a process to ingest data from a Data Lake into a warehouse. The ingestion consists in (1) transferring NoSQL DBs extracted from the Data Lake into a single NoSQL DB (the warehouse), (2) merging so-called ""similar"" classes, and (3) converting the links into references between objects.

In these industries, various types of meters, sensors, and trackers are used to constantly monitor activities, automate processes and optimize tasks. With the help of big data analytics, they can drive decision-making systems based on observations. As a result, the cities-management challenges are growing. The smart cities requirements are increasing to remedy the challenges, which requires a self-organized network composed of a sizeable number of nodes distributed across an area of interest.

Smart energy grids, pervasive computing and communication technologies have enabled the stakeholders in the energy industry to collect large amounts of useful and highly granular energy data. They are generated in large volumes and in a variety of different formats, depending on their originating systems and prospected purposes. Moreover, the data type can be structured and unstructured, in open or proprietary formats. This work focuses on harnessing the power of Big Data Management to propose a first model of an Italian Energy Data Lake: the goal is to create a repository of national energy data that respects the FAIRness' key principles [1], aimed at providing a decision support system and the availability of FAIR data for open science. Starting from data of two thematic areas that are part of the nine common European Data Spaces identified in the European Data Strategy[2], namely the Green Deal data space and the Energy data space, an open and extensible platform to enable secure, resilient acquisition and sharing of information will be presented, for enabling the Green Deal priority actions on issues such as climate change, circular economy, pollution, biodiversity, and deforestation. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

Although being equipped with a myriad of connected smart devices and sensors, the smart city is still physically made up of buildings, roads, parks, industrial sites, shopping centers, etc. Therefore, location-based crisis management endorses a geospatial modeling strategy approach for major hazard data management in a smart city. Hence, spatial data remains always at the center of risk management processes. However, smart and resilient cities still strive to solve the imparity between the huge amounts of geospatial data generated mostly in real time in particular geographic user content contributions also known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and the delayed decision-making. In this paper, we reviewed major studies using VGI in big spatiotemporal data analytics in supporting smart city resilience. Then, we propose a vision of big spatiotemporal data architecture perquisites leveraging big data technologies, VGI and deep learning techniques for smart hazard management. © 2022 IEEE.","Big spatiotemporal data; IoT; Smart city resilience; streaming processing; VGI","Climate change; Climate models; Data Analytics; Decision making; Deep learning; Hazards; Information management; Internet of things; Risk management; Urban growth; Big spatiotemporal data; Data architectures; Exponential growth; Human activities; IoT; Smart city resilience; Spatio-temporal data; Streaming data; Streaming processing; Volunteered geographic information; Smart city","","","","","","","Ministry of Education National Disaster Reduction Center of China 2019 Global Natural Disaster Assessment Report, (2020); U Nation 68 of the World Population Projected to Live in Urban Areas by 2050, (2018); Albino, Vito, Smart cities: Definitions, dimensions, performance, and initiatives, Journal of Urban Technology, 22, 1, pp. 3-21, (2015); Yang, Chaowei Phil, Big Spatiotemporal Data Analytics: a research and innovation frontier, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 34, 6, pp. 1075-1088, (2020); MacHado, Kássio L.S., A Data-Centric Approach for Social and Spatiotemporal Sensing in Smart Cities, IEEE Internet Computing, 23, 1, pp. 9-18, (2019); Ghani, N.

Considering how the manufacturing sector is adopting data-driven operations is challenging, given that there is not a straightforward definition of machine traceability, receiving and storing raw data from manufacturing lines, gives an opportunity to analyse the processes in real time nature. Thanks to big data management platforms and artificial intelligence decision support algorithms, it gives the ability to deeply understand the complexity of the processes and, accordingly, to eliminate or minimise false methods and reduce the costs that are insufficient for production. In addition, one of the biggest preventable costs for metal machining processes is the tool breakage and tool wearing problems. The motivation of this paper is to discuss data-driven decision making possibilities of the tool wearing and optimise breakage costs with using artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the analysis provides a proof-of-concept that the existence of a digital infrastructure combined with the analytical capabilities, such as real-time data management and monitoring, and having a highly accurate LSTM based time-series integrated artificial intelligent predictive model, to deal with inefficiencies in production processes.

This paper systematically summarizes and analyzes the application status of artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest, case-based reasoning (CBR)and other machine algorithms inlost circulation feature prediction, real-time monitoring of lost circulation and application decision-making model. Additionally, a comparison is made on the input parameters, output parameters, test accuracy, and application effects of various machine learning algorithms. On this basis, it has been found that machine learning algorithms tend to have good application prospects in thief zone location prediction, lost circulation monitoring and early warning, and recommendation of measures for preventing and plugging lost circulation. Compared with artificial statistical analysis, the machine learning algorithms have obvious advantages in timeliness, accuracy and large-scale application. However, it is still unable for us to conduct scientific prediction and calculation of the loss pressure, pore/fracture size and other key parameters of lost circulation features and to optimize the field construction using these algorithms. As we know, foreign oil and gas companies made an early start for the overall arrangement of digital drilling and completion technology. At present, they have developed the software for lost circulation prevention and plugging by integrating a variety of machine learning algorithms, and have achieved certain application results in the field. However, China started late in the management of data related to lost circulation prevention and plugging, the development of machine learning algorithms and the research of bundled software, and it has not yet established any mature, reliable digital platform and intelligent expert system for lost circulation prevention and plugging. In order to accelerate the digital and intelligent transformation development of lost circulation technology in China, the research should focus onthe following three aspects:(1)to promote the integration of multi-dimensional data related to lost circulation, build a data lake involving earthquake, logging, drilling, laboratory evaluation and field construction of lost circulation, and make up and improvethe shortcomings of data; (2)to strengthen the explanatory study on machine learning algorithm model, and improve the scientificity and accuracy of the algorithm model based on the mechanisms of lost circulation; (3)to integrate the lost circulation data lake and algorithm modules, establish an intelligent expert system for the intelligent prediction and early warning as well as assistant decision-making of lost circulation in different regions, and formulate fine operation standards for lost circulation prevention and plugging, so as to comprehensively improve the one-time success rate of fd lost circulation control. © 2022, Editorial Office of ACTA PETROLEI SINICA.

Modern Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) distributed training environments are rich with multi-modal, multiformat data representing human performance. As training evolves from individual systems and simulations through distributed exercises and towards joint operational training at theater level, a single exercise produces data in multiple formats, such as system-level data derived from network traffic, self-report assessments, and expert observations. One foundational challenge is capturing and then storing this wealth of data in a common format necessary for analyses spanning the complete dataset. Another foundational challenge is the creation of metadata to support queries and analyses such as predictive models and to enable human performance tracking necessary for the future state of proficiency-based training. A traditional data warehousing approach requires understanding and modeling the data beforehand and is rarely suitable in dynamic training environments where objectives, capabilities, and data collection change frequently. Alternatively, a data lake approach stores unstructured or semi-structured data with a schema-on-read strategy that defers data modeling and interpretation to a point in time nearer data use. To support next-generation training that leverages human performance measurements to inform instructors and decision makers on the readiness of their forces, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL 711HPW) developed and deployed a data lake system tailored to human performance assessment needs. This paper presents use cases, principles driving the data lake architecture, and considerations for a common human performance assessment data storage method. This paper addresses challenges defining an enterprise-level training data architecture suitable for a range of operational and training environments. © Copyright 2021 Lockheed Martin Corporation.","Data lake; Data reuse; Schemas; Semi-structured data; Unlocking data; Unstructured data","Data warehouses; Decision making; Digital storage; Network architecture; Personnel training; Research laboratories; Virtual reality; Data lake; Data retrieval; Data reuse; Data storage; Human performance; Human performance assessment; Schema; Semistructured data; Unlocking data; Unstructured data; Lakes","","","","","Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL","This work was performed for the AFRL 711 HPW/RHW under the direction of Dr. Winston Bennett Jr.","Machines are Driving Wall Street S Wild Ride Not Humans, (2018); What Percentage of Trading is Algorithmic, (2020); Scorm Solved and Explained; Falvo, David A., The use of learning management systems in the United States, TechTrends, 51, 2, pp. 40-45, (2007); Xapi Com Overview; Proceedings of the Interservice Industry Training Simulation and Education Conference, (2006); Future Training Concepts 2020, (2019); Dod Data Strategy, (2020); Air Force Training Further Analysis and Planning Needed to Improve Effectiveness Gao 16 684, (2016); Proceedings of the Interservice Industry Training Simulation and Education Conference I Itsec, (2018)","","","SISO - Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization","","2021 Simulation Innovation Workshop, SIW 2021","2021-02-08 through 2021-02-12","Virtual, Online","174790","","","","","English","Virtual Simul.

During an operational campaign, the Health Monitoring System (HMS) also allows an understanding of how component degradation is affecting the performance of the equipment. Through a structure supported by AI, as data lake and cloud computing, the HMS provides to monitored equipment a fault detection system, early warning alarms to prevent failures and a calculation of the remaining useful life (RUL).The purpose of this paper is to present a prognosis smart system based on AI applied to HMS to support decision-making regarding operational performance of equipment. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) procedure is developed to continuously analyze the mass of monitoring data generated during the machine operation. The ability to learn the behavior patterns of the collected signals and in this way to be able to make parameter predictions with high accuracy makes artificial neural networks a powerful tool to carry out an effective prognosis. Machine operational parameters are monitored simultaneously by the prognosis smart system. Then, this information is processed by the neural network and used to characterize the machine operational condition. Upon detecting a failure trend for one or more parameters monitored by recognizing deterioration patterns, the prognosis system calculates the remaining useful life (RUL) and allows maintainers to take early actions before the failure occurrence.The proposed methodology is applied as part of a HMS of a hydro generator based on parameters registered in operator inspections routes designed to identify critical equipment degradation. The registered data representing one operational year are used to train the neural network regarding normal and abnormal machine condition. After training, the neural network is able to predict failure trends for monitored temperature parameters of the hydro-generator lubricating system that is critical to support equipment performance. Comparing prediction data and data collected by the sensors, the developed neural network reached about 0,98 RMSE score. The remaining useful life prognosis proved to be an important tool to avoid hydro generator components unexpected failures which may affect power output and cause penalties to the power generation company. © 2021 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; health monitoring; remaining useful life; smart prognosis","Cloud computing; Data mining; Fault detection; Forecasting; Health; Hydroelectric generators; Lakes; Outages; Recurrent neural networks; Cloud-computing; Health monitoring; Health monitoring system; Hydro-generators; Informed decision; Neural-networks; Remaining useful lives; Smart manufacturing; Smart prognose; Smart System; Decision making","","","","","","","Wu, Szejung, A neural network integrated decision support system for condition-based optimal predictive maintenance policy, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A:Systems and Humans, 37, 2, pp. 226-236, (2007); Nadai, Nicolas, Equipment failure prediction based on neural network analysis incorporating maintainers inspection findings, Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, (2017); Si, Xiaosheng, Remaining useful life estimation - A review on the statistical data driven approaches, European Journal of Operational Research, 213, 1, pp. 1-14, (2011); Gebraeel, Nagi Z., Residual-life distributions from component degradation signals: A Bayesian approach, IIE Transactions (Institute of Industrial Engineers), 37, 6, pp. 543-557, (2005); Dinardo, Giuseppe, A smart and intuitive machine condition monitoring in the Industry 4.0 scenario, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 126, pp. 1-12, (2018); Gao, Dong, A Novel Indirect Health Indicator Extraction Based on Charging Data for Lithium-Ion Batteries Remaining Useful Life Prognostics, SAE International Journal of Alternative Powertrains, 6, 2, pp. 183-193, (2017); Pereira, Fábio Henrique, Nonlinear autoregressive neural network models for prediction of transformer oil-dissolved gas concentrations, Energies, 11, 7, (2018); Wan, Jiafu, Context-aware cloud robotics for material handling in cognitive industrial Internet of Things, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5, 4, pp. 2272-2281, (2018); Ahmed, Ejaz, The role of big data analytics in Internet of Things, Computer Networks, 129, pp. 459-471, (2017); Yan, Hehua, Industrial Big Data Analytics for Prediction of Remaining Useful Life Based on Deep Learning, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 17190-17197, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE","67th Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, RAMS 2021","2021-05-24 through 2021-05-27","Orlando","174610","0149144X","9781424425099; 9781665460538; 0780317866; 9798350307696; 9781728136899; 9781728180175; 9781457718496; 9781538628706; 1424400074; 9781424400072","","","English","Proc.

Big Data Warehouses and Data Lakes are concepts already well established and implemented by several organizations, to serve their decision-making needs. After analyzing the various problems demonstrated by those monolithic architectures, it is possible to conclude about the need for a paradigm shift that will make organizations truly data-oriented. In this new paradigm, data is seen as the main concern of the organization, and the pipelining tools and the Data Lake itself are seen as a secondary concern. Thus, the Data Mesh consists in the implementation of an architecture where data is intentionally distributed among several Mesh nodes, in such a way that there is no chaos or data silos, since there are centralized governance strategies and the guarantee that the core principles are shared throughout the Mesh nodes. This paper presents the motivation for the appearance of the Data Mesh paradigm, its features, and approaches for its implementation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This is common to most technical applications, but it is particularly true for the drilling operations, where considerable investments and associated risks are involved. During last four years, as part of its digital transformation process, Eni has equipped itself with several digital tools for the diagnosis and the monitoring of drilling and completion operations. Goals and reached benefits can be summarized in risk reduction, operational efficiency and performance optimization. Based on a wide case history started in 2019, a Digital Drilling Package was developed for operations support, from the design to the construction phase. Three main tools are now available to be applied to the most complex wells, either stand-alone or in parallel, covering drilling operations non-productive time (NPT) prediction, performance advanced analytics and real time simulations. This last simulation tool was deployed for the first time in late 2020 on some wells and is now being included in the engineering and operation workflows. Attacking operational NPT and invisible lost time with the aim to increase safety and to reach the technical limit is not only a matter of processing tools. It requires a deep integration with headquarter (HQ), geographical units and field locations, with the definition of a strong data management infrastructure. This paper describes Eni's experience both on-site and in office, showing how the portability and integration of big data systems, suitable data lake architectures and human factor synergies can create effectiveness at all levels. An Africa Offshore field case history is reported to show how predictive and data analytics modelling and tools interact. In addition, the way in which these tools have been managed to support optimum decision-making processes is highlighted. Next development steps will target an even higher level of integration of all available digital tools to have a single diagnostic approach based on univocal dashboards and in-house data server infrastructures. © 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers","","Data Analytics; Data integration; Decision making; Infill drilling; Information management; Integration; Investments; Offshore oil well production; Predictive analytics; Case history; Digital tools; Drilling operation; Market uncertainty; Non-productive time; Offshores; Operational excellence; Performance optimizations; Profit margin; Risks reduction; Digital devices","","","","","","","Burrafato, Sebastiano, Digital disruption in drilling & completion operations, Offshore Mediterranean Conference and Exhibition 2019, OMC 2019, (2019); Cappuccio, Pasquale, Well construction process in a digital era: Data driven approach to support well operations, Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020, (2020); Mayani, Maryam Gholami, Advanced real-time monitoring provides early detection and prevention of costly well problems, SPE/IADC Drilling Conference, Proceedings, 2019-March, (2019); Rossi, Nicola, Big data for advanced well engineering holds strong potential to optimize drilling costs, JPT, Journal of Petroleum Technology, 70, 2, pp. 18-21, (2018); Zausa, Fabrizio, Multi source data analysis to improve drilling efficiency, reduce costs and enhance performance monitoring, Offshore Mediterranean Conference and Exhibition 2019, OMC 2019, (2019)","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)","","SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition 2021, ATCE 2021","2021-09-21 through 2021-09-23","Dubai","171755","","9781555637446; 9781555631482; 9781555636524; 9781613996638; 9781613998595; 9781618392657; 9781613997239; 9781555636395; 9781634398879; 9781555631567","PSAEE","","English","Proc SPE Annu Tech Conf Exhib","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116643282"

These data are usually difficult to access, with poor data quality and many data islands. Besides, with a wide range of sources and complex structure, these data contain essential information and are difficult to manage. However, few existing data management frameworks based on Data Lake excel in solving the persistence and the analysis efficiency for medical multi-source heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose an efficient Multi-source Heterogeneous Data Lake Platform (MHDP) to realize the efficient medical data management. Firstly, we propose an efficient and unified method based on Data Lake to store data of different types and different sources persistently. Secondly, based on the unified data store, an efficient multi-source heterogeneous data fusion is implemented to effectively manage data. Finally, an efficient data query strategy is carried out to assist doctors in medical decision-making. In-depth analysis on applications shows that MHDP delivers better performance for data management in medical domain. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data Lake; Efficient; Medical multi-source heterogeneous data; Persistence of data storage","Data fusion; Decision making; Digital storage; Information management; Complexes structure; Data lake; Data quality; Data storage; Efficient; Heterogeneous data; Medical domains; Medical multi-source heterogeneous data; Multi-Sources; Persistence of data storage; Lakes","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFC0119600)","Acknowledgements.

Furthermore, the recent technological growth renders the business world a very competitive environment. It is essential for companies to make highly accurate decisions in a short period of time in order to compete in such an environment. They have to rely not only on the amount of data that they have gathered but also on the efficiency of gathering new data from external sources. Big Data is a crucial part in the decision making of big and small enterprises. To use Big Data efficiently it is necessary for the companies to rethink their whole data infrastructure. Traditional architectures cannot enable the companies to explore a whole new range of possibilities such as: penetrating new markets, widening their existing ones, enriching their assortment, increasing their profitability and many more.

In recent years, we have witnessed an exponential increase in data production all over the world. This phenomenon is known as big data. Social media platforms, like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube represent the most popular source of big data. Big data coming from social networking sites can be immensely useful for all companies by providing valuable insights on consumer preferences and changing trends. This information presents enormous opportunities for companies that have implemented Big Data management solutions. For this reason, how to store, manage, and transform social media posts into knowledge for decision-makers becomes an important research problem. On the other hand, the massive amount of data generated by users using social media platforms has led to the emergence and development of new technologies and techniques of data management. Data Lake is one of the latest technologies that was introduced to address this challenge in the last period. In this paper, we provide a NoSQL data lake design approach. More precisely, we start by introducing the main concepts of data lake. We also discuss the advantages of data lakes and their impact on big data analytics. Then, we describe some of the recent literature reviews on data lake design approaches. Finally, we provide a NoSQL Data lake using MongoDB that allows storing big data collected from social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data source; Data lake; MongDB; NoSQL; Social media","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Biomimetics; Boron compounds; Data Analytics; Decision making; Information management; Intelligent systems; Lakes; Sodium compounds; Consumer preferences; Data management solution; Exponential increase; Literature reviews; Research problems; Social media platforms; Social networking sites; User-generated content; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Gryncewicz, Wiesława, Agile Approach to Develop Data Lake Based Systems, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 887, pp. 201-216, (2020); Singh, Karamjit, Visual Bayesian fusion to navigate a data lake, FUSION 2016 - 19th International Conference on Information Fusion, Proceedings, pp. 987-994, (2016); Farrugia, Ashley, Towards social network analytics for understanding and managing enterprise data lakes, Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2016, pp. 1213-1220, (2016); Walker, Coral Y., Personal Data Lake with Data Gravity Pull, Proceedings - 2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing, BDCloud 2015, pp. 160-167, (2015); Behehsti, Amin, CoreDB: A data lake service, International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings, Part F131841, pp. 2451-2454, (2017); Munshi, Amr Abdullah A., Data Lake Lambda Architecture for Smart Grids Big Data Analytics, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 40463-40471, (2018); Cha, Byung Rea, International Network Performance and Security Testing Based on Distributed Abyss Storage Cluster and Draft of Data Lake Framework, Security and Communication Networks, 2018, (2018); Chen, Yihua, Enhancing the data privacy for public data lakes, Proceedings of 4th IEEE International Conference on Applied System Innovation 2018, ICASI 2018, pp. 1065-1068, (2018); Małysiak-Mrozek, Bożena, Soft and declarative fishing of information in big data lake, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 26, 5, pp. 2732-2747, (2018); Behehsti, Amin, CoreKG: A Knowledge lake service, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 11, 12, pp. 1942-1945, (2018)","H.

This paper presents Snap4City as a big data smart city platform to support the city decision makers by means of SCCR dashboards and tools reporting in real time the status of several of a city’s aspects. The solution has been adopted in European cities such as Antwerp, Florence, Lonato del Garda, Pisa, Santiago, etc., and it is capable of covering extended geographical areas around the cities themselves: Belgium, Finland, Tuscany, Sardinia, etc. In this paper, a major use case is analyzed describing the workflow followed, the methodologies adopted and the SCCR as the starting point to reproduce the same results in other smart cities, industries, research centers, etc. A Living Lab working modality is promoted and organized to enhance the collaboration among municipalities and public administration, stakeholders, research centers and the citizens themselves. The Snap4City platform has been realized respecting the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and it is capable of processing every day a multitude of periodic and real-time data coming from different providers and data sources. It is therefore able to semantically aggregate the data, in compliance with the Km4City multi-ontology and manage data: (i) having different access policies; and (ii) coming from traditional sources such as Open Data Portals, Web services, APIs and IoT/IoE networks. The aggregated data are the starting point for the services offered not only to the citizens but also to the public administrations and public-security service managers, enabling them to view a set of city dashboards ad hoc composed on their needs, for example, enabling them to modify and monitor public transportation strategies, offering the public services actually needed by citizens and tourists, monitor the air quality and traffic status to establish, if impose or not, traffic restrictions, etc. All the data and the new knowledge produced by the data analytics of the Snap4City platform can also be accessed, observing the permissions on each kind of data, thanks to the presence of an APIs complex system. © 2021, The Author(s).","Advanced APIs; Big data architecture; Decision-support system; IoT; Smart City Control Room","Air quality; Data Analytics; Data privacy; Decision making; Public administration; Smart city; Sustainable development; Web services; Aggregated datum; European cities; Geographical area; Multi-ontologies; Public services; Public transportation; Research center; Traffic restrictions; Open Data","","","","","European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691735)","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the European Commission for funding the REPLICATE SCC1 H2020 project (which exploits Km4City/Snap4City framework) under grant agreement No. 691735, and all the companies and partners involved.

However, the decision outcomes of data science initiatives are not always used or adopted by decision-makers, often due to uncertainty about the quality of data input. It is, therefore, not surprising that organizations are increasingly turning to data governance as a means to improve the acceptance of data science decision outcomes. In this paper, propositions will be developed to understand the role of data governance in creating trust in data science decision outcomes. Two explanatory case studies in the asset management domain are analyzed to derive boundary conditions. The first case study is a data science project designed to improve the efficiency of road management through predictive maintenance, and the second case study is a data science project designed to detect fraudulent usage of electricity in medium and low voltage electrical grids without infringing privacy regulations. The duality of technology is used as our theoretical lens to understand the interactions between the organization, decision-makers, and technology. The results show that data science decision outcomes are more likely to be accepted if the organization has an established data governance capability. Data governance is also needed to ensure that organizational conditions of data science are met, and that incurred organizational changes are managed efficiently. These results imply that a mature data governance capability is required before sufficient trust can be placed in data science decision outcomes for decision-making. © 2020 by the authors.

Decision makers often need to sift through a sea of Big Data to utilize information from a variety of sources in order to determine a course of action. This can be a very difficult and time-consuming task. For each data source encountered, the information can be redundant, conflicting, and/or incomplete. For near-real-time application, there is insufficient time for a human to interpret all the information from different sources. In this project, we have developed a near-real-time, data-agnostic, software architecture that is capable of using several disparate sources to autonomously generate Actionable Intelligence with a human in the loop.

Decisional systems have been used for several years to help decision-makers access, analyze and extract value from the data that their organisation accumulated through the years. The success gained by these types of systems caused the establishment of a well-known architecture and development chain, and the proliferation of tools and methodologies that have proven their value. Nonetheless, in some use cases, the classical decisional architecture shows some shortcomings. In fact, the traditional storage and processing models in Business Intelligence systems are not sufficient anymore when confronted with data that becomes more and more massive, varied and with a high velocity. This is where Big Data solutions can be of great use. In fact, these solutions have proven their efficiency when dealing with enormous constantly increasing amounts of data with a changing schema. Our goal in this article is to show the various manners to integrate big data solutions into the decisional world, and to help architects choose which architecture corresponds better to their needs, by taking into consideration the environmental, technical and functional constraints they are faced with. © 2020 ACM.","big data; business intelligence; data lake; data warehouse; decision tree for decisional architectures; decisional systems; OLAP; software architecture","Architecture; Big data; Decision making; Digital devices; Information analysis; Business intelligence systems; Business success; Data solutions; Decision makers; Decisional system; Functional constraints; High velocity; Processing model; Digital storage","","","","","","","Apache Flink, (2015); Liang, Vince, Adaptive and big data scale parallel execution in oracle, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 6, 11, pp. 1102-1113, (2013); Bifet, Albert, Big data stream learning with SAMOA, IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW, 2015-January, January, pp. 1199-1202, (2015); Chandarana, Parth M., Big data analytics frameworks, 2014 International Conference on Circuits, Systems, Communication and Information Technology Applications, CSCITA 2014, pp. 430-434, (2014); Apache Impala, (2017); DeWitt, David J., Split query processing in polybase, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1255-1266, (2013); Apache Kylin Extreme Olap Engine for Big Data, (2015); Apache Iota, (2017); Hadoop Performance Models, (2011); Marinheiro, António, Analysis of open source business intelligence suites, Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies, CISTI, (2013)","","Reyes, E.; Kembellec, G.; Siala-Kallel, F.; Sfaxi, L.; Ghenima, M.; Saleh, I.","Association for Computing Machinery","","2nd International Conference on Digital Tools and Uses Congress, DTUC 2020","2020-10-15 through 2020-10-17","Virtual, Online","165791","21531633","9781450377881; 9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201","","","English","ACM Int.

For the analysis of passenger flows and decision-making on optimal routes, spatial databases OGS that implement standards have been used. The study substantiates the conclusion that the Big Data technology, implemented according to the cascade principle of information support for the transportation process, ensures the growth of monetization of all its components (transport infrastructure, vehicles and their management system).

With no control over the feed stock and finished material pricing, which are mostly governed by regulations, operators must look with in their Operation & Maintenance (O&M) for possible areas of optimization. In modern days, CIOs are greatly empowered to drive Digital Transformation strategy and contribute in improved profitability. Many of such initiatives fail to deliver the desired outcomes in timely manner. This paper discusses the essential elements of EDGE analytics embedding the fundamental aspects of plant O&M in such Digital Transformation initiatives, and thus enabling faster value realization of the investment. Methods, Procedures, Process: Every industry can be looked in to three different tiers as Assets, Process & systems and Business. Each of them has different outcomes to contribute in overall profitability. Moreover, technology, methodology, people and their collaborative adoption play a big role in achieving those outcomes. Asset performance is evaluated using KPIs like availability, reliability, cost & Safety. Process involves interaction of people & process fluids with those assets. However, the fundaments remain same as the source of information, based on which the O&M decisions are taken. Transducers & measurements around plant assets are the single biggest source of information for such decision making. Often, this information is not best utilized in terms of generating proactive insights. Information from these measurements can be converted into simple analytics. E.g. Proximity type vibration transducer measures vibration amplitude which is used for equipment safe operation and shutdown when exceed the defined threshold. Same transducer also provides the gap voltage and spectral data. Analytics definition using proximity probe gap voltage will identify rotor position within the bearing and then comparing it across the machine train along with orbit preload can give significant information about rotor dynamics. Such analytics available at EDGE are often overlooked in enterprise level predictive analytics deployed by Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning. One of the reasons for it is cyber security concern for the data exchange across IT-OT network layers. This paper talks about implementing comprehensive strategy utilizing the information from EDGE devices for EDGE analytics, various challenges and possible way forward in complying to cyber security requirements for data exchange from OT-IT systems and thus enhancing value of big data in Data Lakes. Results, Observations, Conclusions: EDGE analytics adds immense value for assets in achieving best of performance KPIs. With increased adoption of cyber security practices in plant operations, there are many IT approved architectures exist today to share these analytics insight to L4 - business network. With focus on industry domain experience around systems of systems and progressive thinking, EDGE analytics will play inevitable role in the overall success of O&G 4.0 in coming years. Novel/Additive Information: ""Data is the new oil"". Corporates in energy sectors are driving forth industrial revolution with this belief and investing heavily in big data-based projects. Asset condition monitoring systems at EDGE in OT domain remains in silos. High resolution static & dynamic data in various operating modes collected in these Condition monitoring systems hasn't been historically much interfaced with such big data projects. Use cases of such interfaces with static & dynamic data, benefits, related workflow, data exchange architecture is relatively newer in the industry. Comprehensive discussion of these aspects in this paper will enable industries to realize faster outcomes. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers","","Behavioral research; Costs; Cybersecurity; Decision making; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Investments; Network layers; Network security; Predictive analytics; Condition monitoring systems; Cyber security; Digital transformation; Dynamic data; Gap voltage; Operations maintenance; Performance; Sources of informations; Static datum; Static dynamics; Profitability","","","","","","","undefined; Iso 14224 Kpis Related to Reliability and Maintenance of Industrial Assets","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers","","Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020","2020-11-09 through 2020-11-12","Abu Dhabi","165204","","9781613997345","","","English","Soc.

Although the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have been evolved separately, they are closely intertwined. Indeed, the role of big data in IoT is tremendous as IoT is projected to include billions of connected devices, producing a massive amounts of data within a few years. In this context, big data analytics is a key enabler for unlocking the untapped potential of the IoT and fueling a wide range of data-driven products, services, and business processes. Apache Hadoop is the most prominent and used tool in big data. Hadoop is an open source framework that enables distributed processing of large data sets across commodity clusters. It is designed to scale with built-in high availability and reliability. Additional open source projects have been built around the original Hadoop implementation with the addition of Apache Spark. Spark is the next hype in the industry among the big data tools which was designed to address the shortcomings of Hadoop. Spark provides primitives for in-memory cluster computing which can speed jobs that run on the Hadoop data processing platform. This chapter discusses the details of top Big Data processing frameworks being used today enabling automatic and scalable insight discovery from large and complex data.

In the 1950s, the United Nations (UN) saw this need and proposed 12 areas that should be evaluated, the first of which is listed under ""Health and Demography"", which focuses on what is expressed as the level of a population's health. Decades have passed and great results have been gained from similar initiatives such as reducing mortality from infectious diseases and even eradicating some others. In the age of the digital society, needs have grown. Monitoring demands that once perished from data to become concrete now suffer from the opposite effect, the excess of data from everywhere. Healthcare systems around the world use many different information systems, collecting and generating hundreds of data at unimaginable speed. We are billions of people on the planet and most of us are connected to the virtual world, sharing information, experiences and events with some kind of cloud. In this information age, the ability to aggregate and process this data is a major factor in raising public health to a new level. The development of tools capable of analyzing a large volume of data in seconds and producing knowledge for targeted decision making can help in the fight against specific diseases, in the process of continuing education of professionals, in the formation of new professionals, in the elaboration of new policies. with the specific locoregional look, in the analysis of hidden trends in front of so much information faced in everyday life and other possibilities.

Despite these challenges most operating assets, still keep acquiring more data and creatingdata-load that are never utilised or put into use. This paper aims to demonstrate the reason(s) why we havethis data-load and instigate a solution path in managing this challenge for value realisation. Data is a corporate asset in any organisation but the default 'silo' work culture in most operating assetmakes it difficult to get the relevant insight from these data. Organisation must be deliberate in creatingthe right data architecture from the data process domain through into the distributed control system, intothe data historian, then within the data platform and the visualization realm and finally into the workflowdomain. It is at the workflow domain that we get the 'game-changer' otherwise called value. This is thedifferentiating factor in delivering the 'Big Data' into the space of benefit realisation. This was what wasachieved in a field in Niger Delta and has been shared compared to global best practice. The documented result from this case study showed that any data architecture should be framed to addressasset business need, right from the data process domain function through to the data historian into theworkflow level where the business objective is addressed. Data must be application-centric accounting forscalability, accessibility, security and business performance. Assets need to be clear on why they are acquiring data and not just continuous acquisition of more datawith the resultant effect of data-load without answering the question; what next after data acquisition? Thispaper provides the answer of what next after data acquisition and serves as a quick reference tool for similarchallenge elsewhere, not limited to the oil and gas industry. © 2020 Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition 2020, NAIC 2020.All right reserved.","","Big data; Data acquisition; Data visualization; Decision making; Distributed parameter control systems; Gas industry; History; Oil well testing; Petroleum industry; Application-centric; Benefit realisation; Business objectives; Business performance; Corporate assets; Data architectures; Digital transformation; Oil and Gas Industry; Metadata","","","","","","","Eruvbetine, Obor, Real time reservoir management successes at Sonam gas condensate field, offshore Nigeria, Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition 2018, NAIC 2018, (2018); Offshore Technology Conference, (2013)","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers","","SPE Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition 2020, NAIC 2020","2020-08-11 through 2020-08-13","Virtual, Online","162242","","9781613997857","","","English","Soc.

Organizations are trying more than ever to accent their efforts on industrial development of all data at their disposal and move further away from underpinning technologies. After investing around Data Lake concept, organizations must now overhaul their data architecture to face IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) expansion. Efficient and effective data mapping treatments could serve in understanding the importance of data being transformed and used for decision-making process endorsement. As current relational databases are not able to manage large amounts of data, organizations headed towards NoSQL (Not only Structured Query Language) databases. One such known NoSQL database is MongoDB, which has a high scalability. This article mainly put forward a new data model able to extract, classify, and then map data for the purpose of generating new more structured data that meet organizational needs. This can be carried out by calculating various metadata attributes weights, which are considered as important information. It also processed on data clustering stored into MongoDB.

Asset management organizations are by nature data intensive to manage their assets like bridges, dykes, railways and roads. For this, they often implement data lakes using a variety of architectures and technologies to store big data and facilitate data science initiatives. However, the decision-outcomes of data science models are often highly reliant on the quality of the data. The data in the data lake therefore has to be of sufficient quality to develop trust by decision-makers. Not surprisingly, organizations are increasingly adopting data governance as a means to ensure that the quality of data entering the data lake is and remains of sufficient quality, and to ensure the organization remains legally compliant. The objective of the case study is to understand the role of data governance as success factor for data science. For this, a case study regarding the governance of data in a data lake in the asset management domain is analyzed to test three propositions contributing to the success of using data science. The results show that unambiguous ownership of the data, monitoring the quality of the data entering the data lake, and a controlled overview of standard and specific compliance requirements are important factors for maintaining data quality and compliance and building trust in data science products. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Asset management; Big data; Data governance; Data lake; Data quality; Data science; Digital transformation","Anomaly detection; Asset management; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Information use; Lakes; Railroad transportation; Regulatory compliance; Data governances; Data intensive; Data quality; Decision makers; Decision outcome; Management domains; Quality of data; Success factors; Data Science","","","","","","","Provost, Foster John, Data Science and its Relationship to Big Data and Data-Driven Decision Making, Big Data, 1, 1, pp. 51-59, (2013); Authenticity in A Digital Environment, (2025); Peppers, Don, Extreme trust: The new competitive advantage, Strategy and Leadership, 41, 6, pp. 31-34, (2013); Proceedings of the 1st Australasian Workshop on Information Quality Ausiq, (2006); Symons, John F., Can we trust Big Data?

Knowing the accuracy of an organization's data reflects the level of reliability it can assign to them in decision-making processes. Measuring data accuracy in Big Data environment is a process that involves comparing data to assess with some ""reference data"" considered by the system to be correct. However, such a process can be complex or even impossible in the absence of appropriate reference data. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose an approach to obtain the reference data thanks to the emergence of Big Data technologies. Our approach is based on the upstream selection of a set of criteria that we define as ""Accuracy Criteria"". We use furthermore a set of techniques such as Big Data Sampling, Schema Matching, Record Linkage, and Similarity Measurement.

Seaports are the most critical point in the maritime logistics chain because of its multimodal and complex nature. Consequently, coordinated communication among any seaport stakeholders is vital to improving their operations. Currently, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Port Community Systems (PCS), as primary enablers of digital seaports, have demonstrated their limitations to interchange information on time, accurately, efficiently, and securely, causing high operation costs, low resource management, and low performance. For these reasons, this contribution presents the Seaport Data Space (SDS) based on the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture model to enable a secure data sharing space and promote an intelligent transport multimodal terminal. Each seaport stakeholders implements the IDS connector to take part in the SDS and share their data. On top of SDS, a Big Data architecture is integrated to manage the massive data shared in the SDS and extract useful information to improve the decision-making. The architecture has been evaluated by enabling a port authority and a container terminal to share its data with a shipping company. As a result, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed by using the Big Data architecture functionalities. The KPIs have been shown in a dashboard to allow easy interpretability of results for planning vessel operations. The SDS environment may improve the communication between stakeholders by reducing the transaction costs, enhancing the quality of information, and exhibiting effectiveness. © 2013 IEEE.","Analytics; big data; industrial data spaces; industry 4.0; intelligent transport; Internet of Things; maritime; seaport","Benchmarking; Big data; Decision making; Electronic data interchange; Industry 4.0; Interchanges; Internet of things; Multimodal transportation; Network security; Ports and harbors; Analytics; Industrial datum; Intelligent transport; maritime; seaport; Information management","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (769355); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Secretaría de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación, SENESCYT","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the PIXEL Port Project under Grant 769355, and in part by the Secretaría Nacional de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SENESCYT), Ecuador.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the PIXEL Port Project under Grant 769355, and in part by the Secretar?a Nacional de Educaci?n Superior, Ciencia, Tecnolog?a e Innovaci?n (SENESCYT), Ecuador.","Industry 4 0 Industrial Revolution of the 21st Century, (2018); Hermann, Mario, Design principles for industrie 4.0 scenarios, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2016-March, pp. 3928-3937, (2016); Lu, Yang, Industry 4.0: A survey on technologies, applications and open research issues, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 6, pp. 1-10, (2017); Manufacturing S Next Act, (2015); Second Imo Ghg Study 2009, (2009); Publications Eurostats Maritime Transport of Goods Quarterly Data, (2018); Gharehgozli, Amir Hossein, The role of standardisation in European intermodal transportation, Maritime Business Review, 4, 2, pp. 151-168, (2019); Sung, Tae-kyung, Industry 4.0: A Korea perspective, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 132, pp. 40-45, (2018); International Data Spaces Association, (2018); Open Source Platform for the Smart Digital Future, (2018)","D.

The emission of harmful gases, particularly: the Vertical Column Density (VCD) of CO, SO<inf>2</inf> and NOx, is one of the major factors causing the aforementioned environmental problems. Our research aims to contribute finding solution to this hazardous phenomenon, by using remote sensing (RS) techniques to monitor air quality which may help decision makers. However, RS data is not easy to manage, because of their huge amount, high complexity, variety, and velocity, Thus, our manuscript explains the different aspects of the used satellite data. Furthermore, this article has proven that RS data could be regarded as big data. Accordingly, we have adopted the Hadoop big data architecture and explained how to process efficiently RS environmental data. © © 2020, IGI Global.

Big data platform provided scalable storage to manage enterprise data growth and served easier data access to decision-makers, stakeholders and business users. It is a well-known challenge to classify, organize and store all this data and process it to provide business insights. Due to nature, variety, velocity, volume and value of data make it difficult to effectively process big data. Enterprises face challenges to apply complex business rules, to generate insights and to support data-driven decisions in a timely fashion. As big data lake integrates streams of data from a bunch of business units, stakeholders usually analyze enterprise-wide data from various data models. Data models are a vital component of Big data platform. Users may do complex processing, run queries and perform big table joins to generate required metrics depending on the available data models. It is usually a time consuming and resource-intensive process to find the value from data. It is a no-brainer that big data platform in the enterprise needs high-quality data modeling methods to reach an optimal mix of cost, performance, and quality. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing an effective and scalable way to organize and store data in Big Data Lake. It presents some of the basic principles and methodology to build scalable data models in a distributed environment. It also describes how it overcomes common challenges and presents findings. © 2019 IEEE.","Big Data; Big Data Analytics; Big Data Lake; Business Intelligence; Hadoop; Scalable Data Modeling; Spark","Big data; Competitive intelligence; Data Analytics; Data streams; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric sparks; Information analysis; Lakes; Complex business rules; Complex processing; Data driven decision; Distributed environments; Enterprise applications; Hadoop; High quality data; Scalable storage; Information management","","","","","","","Big Data A Revolution that Will Transform how We Live Work and Think, (2013); Twitter Usage Statistics Internet Live Stats, (2019); Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, (2015); Hashem, Hadi, An integrative modeling of BigData processing, International Journal of Computer Science and Applications, 12, 1, pp. 1-15, (2015); A Study on Big Data Modeling Techniques, (2015); Jurnal Ultima Infosys, (2015); Kaur, Karamjit, Modeling and querying data in NoSQL databases, Proceedings - 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2013, pp. 1-7, (2013); Bhadani, Abhay Kumar, Big data: Challenges, opportunities, and realities, Effective Big Data Management and Opportunities for Implementation, pp. 1-24, (2016); Preprints, (2018); International Journal of Database Management Systems, (2019)","J.

This data comes in various forms and formats which surpass the data management, integration and analysis capabilities of existing project intelligence tools used within the industry. Several tasks in the project lifecycle bear implications for the efficient planning and delivery of construction projects. Setting up right profit margins and its continuous tracking as projects progress are vital management tasks that require data-driven decision support. Existing profit estimation measures use a company or industry wide benchmarks to guide these decisions. These benchmarks are oftentimes unreliable as they do not factor in project-specific variations. As a result, projects are wrongly estimated using uniform rates that eventually end up with entirely unusual margins either due to underspends or overruns. This study proposed a project analytics approach where Big Data is harnessed to understand the profitability distribution of different types of construction projects. To this end, Big Data architecture is recommended, and a prototype implementation is shown to store and analyse large amounts of projects data. Our data analysis revealed that profit margins evolve, and the profitability performance varies across several project attributes. These insights shall be incorporated as knowledge to machine learning algorithms to predict project margins accurately. The proposed approach enabled the fast exploration of data to understand the underlying pattern in the profitability performance for different types of construction projects. © 2019 The Authors","Big data; Machine learning; Profitability performance; Project analytics; System architecture","Big data; Construction industry; Decision support systems; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Life cycle; Machine learning; Profitability; Analysis capabilities; Construction projects; Continuous tracking; Data architectures; Data driven decision; Project analytics; Prototype implementations; System architectures; Project management","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Innovate UK, (102473, 54832–413479); Innovate UK; (EP/S031480/1)","The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to Innovate UK through grant application number 54832\u2013413479 ; file number 102473 and Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) through grant reference number EP/S031480/1 for providing financial support to carryout this study.","Rui, Zhenghua, Investigation into the performance of oil and gas projects, Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering, 38, pp. 12-20, (2017); Luu, Van Truong, Improving project management performance of large contractors using benchmarking approach, International Journal of Project Management, 26, 7, pp. 758-769, (2008); Kumar, Ashok, Integrating quality function deployment and benchmarking to achieve greater profitability, Benchmarking, 13, 3, pp. 290-310, (2006); Jacobs, Adam, The pathologies of big data, Communications of the ACM, 52, 8, pp. 36-44, (2009); Singh, Dilpreet, A survey on platforms for big data analytics, Journal of Big Data, 2, 1, (2015); Mckinsey Quarterly, (2010); Diebold, Francis X., “Big data” dynamic factor models for macroeconomic measurement and forecasting: A discussion of the papers by Lucrezia Reichlin and by Mark W.

Processing and analysis of big data are challenging issues to acquire quality information in order to support accurate medical drug practice. The quality of data taxonomy is indicated by three basic elements: are meaningful, predication and decision-making. These elements have been encouraged in previous work that focused on the same challenges of big data. Consequently, the proposed approach preserves the quality of medical drug data toward meaningful data lake by clustering. It consists of four components. Data collection and pre-processing represent the first component in the data lake. Profile data is treated with semi-structured data to clean it up. The second component is extracting data through enforcing rules on whole data to produce different groups and generate weight based on constraints within groups. In component three, data is organized and clustering. This component complies with schema profiling referring to component two in the data lake. Weight outputs of component three are inputs for component four, where K-Mean clustering is applied to obtain different clusters. Each cluster presents an alternative drug to achieve meaningful drug data that is consistent with component three in the data lake.This paper addressed two main challenges; the first challenge is extracting meaningful data from big data; whereas the second challenge is using big data technique with K-Mean clustering algorithm. An experimental approach was followed through using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data and symptoms in R framework. ANOVA statistical test was carried out to calculate sum of square error, P-Value and F-Valuefor the evaluation of variances between clusters and variances within clusters. The results showed the efficiency of the proposed approach. © BEIESP.","Big Data; Data Lake; K-Mean Clustering; Semi-structured Data","","","","","","","","Halevy, Alon Y., Goods: Organizing Google's datasets, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, 26-June-2016, pp. 795-806, (2016); Madera, Cédrine, The next information architecture evolution: The data lake wave, 8th International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems, MEDES 2016, pp. 174-180, (2016); An Int J Adv Comput Technol, (2019); Hai, Rihan, Constance: An intelligent data lake system, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, 26-June-2016, pp. 2097-2100, (2016); Terrizzano, Ignacio G., Data wrangling: The challenging journey from the wild to the lake, CIDR 2015 - 7th Biennial Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, (2015); Development Planning in the Big Data Era Design References Architecture; Fang, Huang, Managing data lakes in big data era: What's a data lake and why has it became popular in data management ecosystem, 2015 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control and Intelligent Systems, IEEE-CYBER 2015, pp. 820-824, (2015); International Journal of Engineering Technology, (2018); Itm Web Conf, (2018); MacCioni, Antonio, Crossing the finish line faster when paddling the Data Lake with kayak, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 10, 12, pp. 1853-1856, (2017)","A.

In this way, the healthcare providers and the policy makers can acquire and process the data of a patient despite its initial format and source, allowing an improved quality of patient care and optimizing the management of the financial resources. To further exploit this huge resource of health and social data, it is very important to allow the extraction of the complex information buried under the Big Data source enabled by the EHRs, providing the physicians, the researchers and public health policy makers with innovative instruments. Meeting this need is not a trivial task, due to the difficulties of processing different document formats and processing Natural Language text, alongside to the problems related to the data size.

However, the UASs have many models, with scattered equipments and no systematic management. Meanwhile, some safety issues exist. This urgently requires the relevant regulatory authorities to regulate, supervise, and maintain safe flight operations by taking their operating rules and characteristics into account. In order to standardize the operation of light and small civil UASs across the country and promote the industry development, the Civil Aviation Administration of China has issued the ""Provisions for the Operation of Light and Small Unmanned Aircraft (for Trial Implementation)"" advisory circular and the ""Specification for Interface Data of Unmanned Aircraft System Cloud System"". The UAS cloud data exchange platform was developed in 2016, and the data sharing of multiple UAS cloud systems in China was realized. With this platform the UASs registered in different UAS cloud systems are visible to each other in the same airspace, which improved the flight safety of China's low-altitude airspace. However, with the rapid development of the application of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry, the number of UAVs supervised by the Civil Aviation Authority and the data on the operation of the UAVs has increased dramatically, which has also brought great challenges to the traditional data management methods. In this paper, we will describe the current situation of the operation of big data from the UAS cloud data exchange platform in China followed by discussion on the technical bottle necks in the statistical analysis of the operation data of the traditional UAS. Then we will propose a statistical analysis method for the UAS operation data, and establish a framework of statistical analysis of big data from the cloud data exchange platform. In the end, we will outline how to use Apache Spark and Cassandra database to quickly process, store, count, and analyze the massive data generated by the UAS cloud data exchange platform. The research situation of implementing various statistical index algorithms based on the platform is introduced in detail. This research not only improves the efficiency of statistical analysis of UAS operation data, but also provides the operation management rules of China's light and small UASs from multiple dimensions. sWe highlight that the UAS has significant operational characteristics, which are different from general and transportation aviations.

D2D communication technique is an optimized method to support various demands on massive data transfer rates among the users in 5G networks. Massive MIMO (Multiple-input and Multiple-output) based antenna systems are deployed to achieve these huge data demands in 5G technology. However, the drawbacks owing to expanding computational overhead in methods of allocating resource, reducing interference, energy optimization and several other problems in D2D networks are compromised with the help of emerging technology of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Furthermore, a novel approach based on AI is implemented with an Architectural design for D2D network in decision making over the implementation of techniques based on the persisting situation in the D2D network. Finally, Security protocols based on network demands are implemented through AI in D2D Communications of Massive MIMO based 5G Networks. © 2019 IEEE.","Big Data Lake; Cloud Server; COBRA Technology; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Massive MIMO; Software-Defined Radio","Antennas; Artificial intelligence; Data transfer; Data transfer rates; Decision making; Network protocols; Network security; Queueing networks; Software radio; Cloud servers; Cobra technology; Computational overheads; Emerging technologies; Energy optimization; Multiple input and multiple outputs; Security protocols; Software-defined radios; 5G mobile communication systems","","","","","","","Ferńandez, Alberto, Evolutionary fuzzy systems for explainable artificial intelligence: Why, when, what for, and where to?, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 14, 1, pp. 69-81, (2019); Ansari, Rafay Iqbal, 5G D2D Networks: Techniques, Challenges, and Future Prospects, IEEE Systems Journal, 12, 4, pp. 3970-3984, (2018); Savulescu, Corina, An approach for systems identification using artificial inteligence, Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence, ECAI 2017, 2017-January, pp. 1-4, (2017); Oyekanlu, Emmanuel A., Towards Low-Cost, Real-Time, Distributed Signal and Data Processing for Artificial Intelligence Applications at Edges of Large Industrial and Internet Networks, Proceedings - 2018 1st IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering, AIKE 2018, pp. 166-167, (2018); Miyashita, Shohei, Developing game AI agent behaving like human by mixing reinforcement learning and supervised learning, Proceedings - 18th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing, SNPD 2017, pp. 489-494, (2017); Shalmashi, Serveh, Energy efficiency and sum rate tradeoffs for massive MIMO systems with underlaid device-to-device communications, Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2016, 1, (2016); O’Leary, Daniel E., Embedding AI and crowdsourcing in the big data lake, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 29, 5, pp. 70-73, (2014); Bai, Cheng, Optical Network Management Data Integration and Fusion in Multi-Domain Optical Networks, Proceedings - 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation, Big Data and Smart City, ICITBS 2018, 2018-January, pp. 174-178, (2018); Huang, Yungfa, Performance of Resource Allocation for D2D Communications in Q-Learning Based Heterogeneous Networks, 2018 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics-Taiwan, ICCE-TW 2018, (2018); Qatan, Fatima M., Performance comparison of TCP algorithms for D2D communication in LTE-A, 2017 International Conference on Electrical and Computing Technologies and Applications, ICECTA 2017, 2018-January, pp. 1-4, (2017)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics, ICOEI 2019","2019-04-23 through 2019-04-25","Tirunelveli","152706","","9781538694398","","","English","Proc.

Achieving this evolution is a task full of challenges. One of these challenges is the interoperability of the stakeholders' information systems. Interoperability has been widely studied but there is still some reluctance to adopt the solutions because the stakeholders are afraid of sharing their data. Recently, the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture proposes several recommendations and specifications to solve this issue based on data sovereignty concept. This architecture has not been studied nor implemented for the seaport use case yet. For this reason, this paper presents a seaport data space based on IDS architecture to share information in a secure and interoperable manner. Along with this, a big data architecture is added to exploit the shared data. The seaport data space is implemented using the FIWARE IoT platform. The seaport data space is tested by sharing the data of the port authority to the port terminal and analyzing the large shared data through descriptive analysis. The results show that by using the seaport data space, the shared data allow improving the decision making in the planning operations of the seaport. © 2019 IEEE.","Big Data; IDS; Industry; Internet of Things; Interoperability; seaport","Big data; Decision making; Industry; Interoperability; Network security; Ports and harbors; Data architectures; Data space; Descriptive analysis; Industrial datum; Port authorities; Reference architecture; seaport; Shared data; Internet of things","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Secretaría de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación, SENESCYT; Horizon 2020, (769355); Horizon 2020","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the Ecuadorian Government through the Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation (SENESCYT) and has received funding from the European Union’s “Horizon 2020” research and innovation program as a part of the PIXEL project under Grant Agreement No. 769355.","Publications Eurostats Maritime Trasport of Goods Quarterly Data; Liu, Chin I., Comparing different technologies for containers movement in marine container terminals, IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Proceedings, ITSC, pp. 488-493, (2000); Zezulka, František, Industry 4.0 – An Introduction in the phenomenon, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 49, 25, pp. 8-12, (2016); Weyrich, Michael, Reference architectures for the internet of things, IEEE Software, 33, 1, pp. 112-116, (2016); Lu, Yang, Industry 4.0: A survey on technologies, applications and open research issues, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 6, pp. 1-10, (2017); Belsa, Andreu, Flow-based programming interoperability solution for IoT platform applications, Proceedings - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2018, pp. 304-309, (2018); Reference Architecture Model for the Industrial Data Space, (2019); International Data Spaces; Baron, Marie Laure, PCS interoperability in Europe: A market for PCS operators?, International Journal of Logistics Management, 24, 1, pp. 117-129, (2013); Huiskonen, Janne, How port community systems can contribute to port competitiveness: Developing a cost-benefit framework, Research in Transportation Business and Management, 19, pp. 51-64, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc); IEEE Consumer Electronics Society; IEEE Reliability Society; IEEE Sensors Council; IEEE Signal Processing Society","5th IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things, WF-IoT 2019","2019-04-15 through 2019-04-18","Limerick","149877","","9781538649800","","","English","IEEE World Forum Internet Things, WF-IoT - Conf.

Organizational decisions, artificial intelligence, machine learning, time critical processes, analytics, etc. are driven by highly profiled data. Data gives an organization the ability to act in a corresponding situation and hence, keep up with the market. Financial returns are directly associated with the quality of data being used. Today's world has experienced a data explosion with the advent of data sources like Hadoop, data lakes, clusters and many more. Even more, the day to day devices that we use collect data to present meaningful statistics to us. There is an exponential increase in data volumes which are characterized by heterogeneous data formats and disparate data sources which in turn is complicating the task of providing uniform and profiled data to the business users for analysis. Warehousing is also not able to cope up with the on-demand real-time data access. Holistic view of the entire data is extremely difficult to achieve and takes a considerable amount of time which is slowing down an organization's decision making capabilities. The complexity of the current systems has increased due to the interconnected nature of widely distributed systems which share data. Dirty data i.e. data which is inaccurate, inconsistent, unclean or incomplete is spread all across. As all the data is unrequired garbage data, there is no point in developing your business intelligence over this data. Data Clarity used along with Data Virtualization provides an exceptional solution to these problems by handling the complex data workloads with respect to heterogeneous data and disparate data sources and provides a holistic view of the data to the business organization. © 2019 IEEE.","Active clusters; Data Clarity; Data Intelligence; Data life-cycle management; Data Virtualization; disparate data sources; Extensible Style sheet Language Transformations; Extraction; Federated Query Engine; metadata management; Transformation and Loading","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Virtualization; Business organizations; Data virtualization; Distributed systems; Exponential increase; Financial returns; Heterogeneous data; Quality of data; Real time data access; Data handling","","","","","","","Fiore, Sandro Luigi, Data virtualization in grid environments through the GRelC Data Access and Integration Service, International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, ICITST 2009, (2009); Mousa, Ayad Hameed, Data Warehouse and Data Virtualization Comparative Study, Proceedings - 2015 International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering, DeSE 2015, pp. 369-372, (2016); Earley, Seth, Data Virtualization and Digital Agility, IT Professional, 18, 5, pp. 70-72, (2016); Data Cleaning A Practical Perspective, (2013); Pan, Bin, Design and realization of an ETL method in business intelligence project, 2018 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis, ICCCBDA 2018, pp. 275-279, (2018); Hamad, Murtadha Mohammad, An enhanced technique to clean data in the data warehouse, Proceedings - 4th International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering, DeSE 2011, pp. 306-311, (2011)","O.V.

Throughout all this change, the basic principles that shape the architecture of data have remained the same. There remains a need for people to take a look at the ""bigger picture"" and to understand where their data fit into the grand scheme of things. Data Architecture: A Primer for the Data Scientist, Second Edition addresses the larger architectural picture of how big data fits within the existing information infrastructure or data warehousing systems. This is an essential topic not only for data scientists, analysts, and managers but also for researchers and engineers who increasingly need to deal with large and complex sets of data. Until data are gathered and can be placed into an existing framework or architecture, they cannot be used to their full potential. Drawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples and case studies from across various industries, the authors seek to explain this larger picture into which big data fits, giving data scientists the necessary context for how pieces of the puzzle should fit together. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The two concepts are providing opportunities for businesses to better strengthen data management and achieve competitive advantages. Evaluating and selecting the most suitable approach is however challenging. These two types of data storage are often confused, whereas they have many more differences than similarities. In fact, the only real similarity between them is their ability to store data. To effectively deal with this issue, this paper analyses these emerging Big Data technologies and presents a comparison of the selected data storage concepts. The main aim is then to propose and demonstrate the use of an AHP model for the Big Data storage selection, which may be used by businesses, public sector institutions as well as citizens to solve multiple criteria decision-making problems. This multi-criteria classification approach has been applied to define which of the two models is better suited for data management. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","AHP model; Big Data; Data Lake; Data storage platforms; Data Warehouse; Decision-making","Analytic hierarchy process; Big data; Competition; Data warehouses; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Lakes; Competitive advantage; Data storage; Data technologies; Multi criteria group decision making; Multi-criteria classification; Multiple criteria decision-making problems; Paper analysis; Public sector; Digital storage","","","","","","","Tsuchiya, Satoshi, Big data processing in cloud environments, Fujitsu Scientific and Technical Journal, 48, 2, pp. 159-168, (2012); Intel, (2012); Information Systems Management in the Big Data Era, (2014); Shamsi, Jawwad Ahmed, Data-Intensive Cloud Computing: Requirements, Expectations, Challenges, and Solutions, Journal of Grid Computing, 11, 2, pp. 281-310, (2013); Singh, Dilpreet, A survey on platforms for big data analytics, Journal of Big Data, 2, 1, (2015); Saaty, Thomas L., How to make a decision: The analytic hierarchy process, European Journal of Operational Research, 48, 1, pp. 9-26, (1990); International Journal of Services Sciences, (2008); Vaidya, Omkarprasad S., Analytic hierarchy process: An overview of applications, European Journal of Operational Research, 169, 1, pp. 1-29, (2006); Information Systems Today Managing in the Digital World, (2010); Acta Informatica Pragensia, (2015)","J.

However, existing works on metadata management in data lakes mainly focus on structured and semi-structured data, with little research on unstructured data.

Multidimensional modeling is a special approach to modeling data, considered the foundation for building data warehouses. With the explosive growth in the amount of heterogeneous data (most of which external to the organization) in the latest years, the DW has been impacted by the need to interoperate and deal with the complexity of this new type of information, such as big data, data lakes and cognitive computing platforms, becoming evident the need to improve the semantic expressiveness of the DW. Research has shown that ontological theories can play a fundamental role in improving the quality of conceptual models, reinforcing their potential to support semantic interoperability in its various manifestations. In this paper we propose the application of ontological patterns, grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO), for conceptual modeling in multidimensional models, in order to improve the semantic expressiveness of the models used to represent analytical data in a DW. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conceptual modeling; Data warehouse; Multidimensional modeling; Ontological patterns","Data warehouses; Decision making; Information systems; Information use; Semantics; Cognitive Computing; Conceptual model; Heterogeneous data; Multi-dimensional model; Ontological patterns; Ontological theories; Semantic interoperability; Unified foundational ontologies (UFO); Ontology","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (88881.173022/2018-01); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Libera Università di Bolzano, UNIBZ","CAPES (PhD grant# 88881.173022/2018-01) and OCEAN project (UNIBZ).","Abelló, Alberto, YAM2: a multidimensional conceptual model extending UML, Information Systems, 31, 6, pp. 541-567, (2006); Ontology Patterns Clarifying Concepts and Terminology, (2013); Using A Well Founded Multi Level Theory to Support the Analysis and Representation of the Powertype Pattern in Conceptual Modeling, (2016); Dahchour, Mohamed, The semantics of reifying n-ary relationships as classes, ICEIS 2002 - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, 2, pp. 580-586, (2002); Essays in Honor of Carl G Hempel, (1969); Franconi, Enrico, A Data Warehouse Conceptual Data Model, Proceedings of the International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management, SSDBM, 16, pp. 435-436, (2004); Proc Ijcai 91, (1991); Golfarelli, Matteo, The dimensional fact model: A conceptual model for data warehouses, International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems, 7, 2-3, pp. 215-247, (1998); Relationships and Events Towards A General Theory of Reification and Truthmaking, (2016); Guarino, Nicola, Reification and truthmaking patterns, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 11157 LNCS, pp. 151-165, (2018)","G.

The International Patent Classification (IPC) is used for classifying the patents according to their technological areas. However, these classifications are quite inconsistent in various aspects because of the complexity and they may not be available for all areas of technology specially the emerging areas. This work introduces methods that applied on unstructured patents texts for detecting accurate technological areas to which the invention relates, and identifies semantically meaningful communities/topics for a large collection of patent documents. A hybrid text mining techniques with scalable analytics service that involves natural language processing which built on top of big-data architecture are used to extract the significant technical areas. Community detection approach is applied for efficiently identifying communities/topics by clustering the network graph of technological areas of inventions. A comparison to the standard LDA clustering is presented. Finally, regression analysis methods are applied in order to discover the interesting trends. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Community detection; Patent analysis; Topic modeling","Decision making; Natural language processing systems; Population dynamics; Regression analysis; Clusterings; Community detection; Decisions makings; International patents; Natural languages; Patent analysis; Patent classifications; Patent documents; Text mining techniques; Topic Modeling; Patents and inventions","","","","","","","Yan, Bowen, Measuring technological distance for patent mapping, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 68, 2, pp. 423-437, (2017); Abbas, Assad, A literature review on the state-of-the-art in patent analysis, World Patent Information, 37, pp. 3-13, (2014); Chi 2012, (2012); Chen, Hongshu, Modeling technological topic changes in patent claims, Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, 2015-September, pp. 2049-2059, (2015); Tang, Jie, PatentMiner: Topic-driven patent analysis and mining, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1366-1374, (2012); Guidelines for Preparing Patent Landscape Reports, (2015); Sofean, Mustafa, Automatic segmentation of big data of patent texts, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 10440 LNCS, pp. 343-351, (2017); Waltman, Ludo, A smart local moving algorithm for large-scale modularity-based community detection, European Physical Journal B, 86, 11, (2013); Sofean, Mustafa, A Workflow-Based Large-Scale Patent Mining and Analytics Framework, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 920, pp. 210-223, (2018); Buckley, Chris, Retrieval evaluation with incomplete information, Proceedings of Sheffield SIGIR - Twenty-Seventh Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 25-32, (2004)","M.

It was limited to huge-scale businesses such as government and huge organisations that would afford to establish their very own infrastructure to process big data. These days, small and medium-sized companies are making an investment on big data projects to help their decision making, research and improvement activities, within the desire to advantage a few insight perspectives and in the end achieving competitive benefits in market share. Big data has become an irreplaceable a part of every financial system, organization, business strength what is more character. traditional database structures aren’t always capable of capture, store and analyses this huge quantity of data. security and privacy issues are intension via velocity, volume, and variety of big data, which includes big-scale cloud infrastructures, range of statistics assets and formats, and high quantity inter-cloud migration. Therefore, conventional safety mechanisms, which are tailored to securing small-scale static data, are inadequate. With a rapid growth of data, whether the traditional security and data protection still adequate to be adopted into big data architecture and environment is questionable.

The voluminous data generated from the various sources can be processed and analyzed to support decision making. However data analytics is prone to privacy violations. One of the applications of data analytics is recommendation systems which is widely used by ecommerce sites like Amazon, Flip kart for suggesting products to customers based on their buying habits leading to inference attacks. Although data analytics is useful in decision making, it will lead to serious privacy concerns. Hence privacy preserving data analytics became very important.

With this perspective, this study investigates sustainable energy consumption in the industrial and mining sectors. Although these sectors are experiencing exponential data growth, their adoption of big data technologies is limited. Hence, big data methods were applied to design a big data system that makes novel use of microservices and containers for modularity and extensibility. A hybrid architecture incorporating characteristics from polyglot persistence, data lakes and Lambda architecture was used. MongoDB served as the primary data store. The system was implemented for an engineering services company. The implementation yielded seven case studies, which illustrate the impact of big data on decision-making at the various levels of the hierarchy within an organisation. Valuable insights were delivered to personnel at the different levels of the organisational hierarchy. By developing these insights, directed at the appropriate personnel, improved decisions were taken and suitable actions initiated to achieve sustainable energy consumption reductions. The overall impact of the case studies was an energy saving of 75 622 MWh, a reduction of 74 111 Mg of carbon-dioxide-emission, and a saving of 108 141 m3 of water. Sustained reductions in energy consumption result in cleaner production and will eventually aid in addressing the various energy challenges confronting the economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Containers; Hybrid architecture; Microservices; Organisational hierarchy insights; Sustainable energy consumption","Carbon dioxide; Containers; Data mining; Decision making; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Global warming; Magnesium compounds; Personnel; Pollution control; Big data technologies; Carbon dioxide emissions; Engineering service; Hybrid architectures; Microservices; Organisational; Production and consumption; Sustainable energy; Big data","","","","","","","Atabani, A.

Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (TE) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the TE community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.The true product of TE is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the TE community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during TE. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace. The net result of these commercial best practices is a solid foundation for the DoD to transform how it uses data to achieve faster, better, and smarter decisions throughout the acquisition lifecycle. © 2018 IEEE.","Big Data; Cloud Computing; Data Analytics; Data Management; Department of Defense; Knowledge Management; Predictive Maintainance; Test and Evaluation; Virtualization","Aggregates; Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Knowledge management; Predictive analytics; Quality control; Virtualization; Acquisition systems; Cloud-computing; Data analytics; Department of Defence; Joint Strike Fighters; Predictive maintainance; Predictive models; Test and evaluation; Virtualizations; Weapon system; Decision making","","","","","","","","","Abe, N.; Liu, H.; Pu, C.; Hu, X.; Ahmed, N.; Qiao, M.; Song, Y.; Kossmann, D.; Liu, B.; Lee, K.; Tang, J.; He, J.; Saltz, J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Baidu; et al.; Expedia Group; IEEE; IEEE Computer Society; Squirrel AI Learning","2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2018","2018-12-10 through 2018-12-13","Seattle","144531","","9781538650356","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

There are few IoT systems in the present literature that are focused on monitoring and management of COPD patients, but they are not focused on the vast amount of data that IoT generates in a large scale deployment, and the integration of Smart City services. For these reasons, this paper presents an innovative system based on Cloud Computing and Big Data technologies to integrate Smart City services into a large scale scenario. To do so, this system proposes a Big Data architecture based on Apache Spark libraries to provide data integration, storage, descriptive and predictive analysis. Also, the system provides a web interface application where users can visualize the data analysis results. They show that the data enrichment function performed on the Big Data architecture provides more information about the environment to improve decisionmaking. This way, the system helps COPD patients to get more involved into decision making process and promote an active and healthy life by recommending the least polluted area to performance their daily activities. © 2018 IEEE.","Big data; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Component; Internet of things; Smart city","Data integration; Decision making; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Information management; Internet of things; Pulmonary diseases; Smart city; Big data technologies; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Component; Decision making process; Innovative systems; Large-scale deployment; Monitoring and management; Respiratory function; Big data","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (687283)","","Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; Chronic Respiratory Diseases; A Formative Evaluation of an Ehealth Service for Patients with Copd Methods, (2017); Ding, Hang, A mobile-health system to manage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patients at home, Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, EMBS, pp. 2178-2181, (2012); Patel, Shyamal, Using wearable sensors to monitor physical activities of patients with COPD: A comparison of classifier performance, Proceedings - 2009 6th International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks, BSN 2009, pp. 234-239, (2009); Hassanalieragh, Moeen, Health Monitoring and Management Using Internet-of-Things (IoT) Sensing with Cloud-Based Processing: Opportunities and Challenges, Proceedings - 2015 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing, SCC 2015, pp. 285-292, (2015); Yacchirema, Diana C., Enable IoT interoperability in ambient assisted living: Active and healthy aging scenarios, 2017 14th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, CCNC 2017, pp. 53-58, (2017); Botta, Alessio, On the integration of cloud computing and internet of things, Proceedings - 2014 International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud, FiCloud 2014, pp. 23-30, (2014); Díaz, Manuel, State-of-the-art, challenges, and open issues in the integration of Internet of things and cloud computing, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 67, pp. 99-117, (2016); Chen, Min, Big data: A survey, Mobile Networks and Applications, 19, 2, pp. 171-209, (2014)","","Li, J.; Chandra, A.; Guo, T.; Cai, Y.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2018","2018-04-17 through 2018-04-20","Orlando","136574","","9781538650080","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In this sense, looking for a new technology that allows data processing on a large scale, and with a complex structure, is that it has been using the new generation of Business Intelligence technology, known as Big Data. In recent years, solutions have been proposed for Big Data management issues of water resources in general.

The abundance of raw data necessitates the use of data analytics in order to extract useful patterns for decision making. Current architectures for big data analytics in the IoT domain address the large volume and velocity of the produced data. However, they do not address the semantic heterogeneity in the data models used by diverse IoT platforms, which emerges when large-scale deployments, spanning across multiple deployment sites, are considered. This paper proposes an architecture for big data analytics in the context of large-scale IoT systems consisting of multiple IoT platforms. A Semantic Interoperability Layer (SIL) handles the inter-operability among the data models of the individual platforms, using semantic mappings between them and a unified ontology. Data queries to the SIL and result collection is handled by a cloud-based data management layer, namely the Data Lake, along with storage of metadata needed by data analytics methods. Based on this infrastructure, web-based data analytics and visual analytics methods are used to analyze the collected data, while being agnostic of platform-specific details. The proposed architecture is developed in the context of healthcare provision for older people, although it can be applied to any IoT domain. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018 Published by Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

By using the big data technologies that enable efficient data processing, the value of the data increases, as these technologies can turn the data into actionable information that influences important decision-making processes. However, a broader view of the operational environment, an investigated phenomena, and challenges related to them can frequently be obtained after combining data from many data sets located in various big data lakes. This requires contact points in both data lakes that must be flexibly joined because in many cases, data sets do not correspond to one another directly. In this paper, we show fuzzy join operation for flexible combining big data lakes. The fuzzy join transforms numerical values of common attributes of joined data sets into fuzzy sets and uses such a representation in the join operation. We propose two variants of the join operation that transforms crisp numerical values of joining attributes into: 1) fuzzy numbers and 2) linguistic terms. The fuzzy join operation is implemented and tested in the declarative U-SQL language that is used for scalable and parallel querying in big data lakes. The ideas presented here are exemplified by a distributed analysis of cardiac disease data on Microsoft Azure cloud. The results of the conducted experiments confirm that the fuzzy join can enrich data sets that are used in making critical decisions and, as a highly scalable cloud-based solution, can be successfully used in processing large volumes of data delivered by cyber-physical systems. © 2013 IEEE.","big data; biomedical data analysis; cloud computing; Cyber-physical systems; declarative languages; fuzzy logic; querying","Cloud computing; Cyber Physical System; Data handling; Decision making; Embedded systems; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Lakes; Linguistics; Monitoring; Sensors; Windows operating system; Big data technologies; Biomedical data analysis; Biomedical monitoring; Decision making process; Declarative Languages; Large amounts of data; Operational environments; querying; Big data","","","","","(BK/213/RAU2/2018); Microsoft Research, (02/020/RGH18/0148); Microsoft Research","This work was supported in part by the Microsoft Research within Microsoft Azure for Research Award Grant, in part by the Habilitation Grant of the Rector of the Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland, under Grant 02/020/RGH18/0148, and in part by the Statutory Research Funds of Institute of Informatics, Silesian University of Technology, under Grant BK/213/RAU2/2018.","Xu, Lida, Big data for cyber physical systems in industry 4.0: a survey, Enterprise Information Systems, 13, 2, pp. 148-169, (2019); National Academies Press, (2013); Cb, (2018); Darwish, Tasneem S.J., Fog Based Intelligent Transportation Big Data Analytics in The Internet of Vehicles Environment: Motivations, Architecture, Challenges, and Critical Issues, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 15679-15701, (2018); Małysiak-Mrozek, Bożena, Soft and declarative fishing of information in big data lake, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 26, 5, pp. 2732-2747, (2018); Marjani, Mohsen, Big IoT Data Analytics: Architecture, Opportunities, and Open Research Challenges, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 5247-5261, (2017); Munshi, Amr Abdullah A., Data Lake Lambda Architecture for Smart Grids Big Data Analytics, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 40463-40471, (2018); Zou, Quan, Survey of MapReduce frame operation in bioinformatics, Briefings in Bioinformatics, 15, 4, pp. 637-647, (2014); Wu, Gongqing, Entity Linking: An Issue to Extract Corresponding Entity with Knowledge Base, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 6220-6231, (2018); VLDB, (2002)","D.

Once the data is analysed it promises better student placement processes; more accurate enrolment forecasts, and early warning systems that identify and assist students at-risk of failing or dropping out. Big data is becoming a key to creating competitive advantages in higher education. Like with any organization, traditional data processing and analysis of structured and unstructured data using RDBMS and data warehousing no longer satisfy big data challenges. The lack of adequate conceptual architectures for big data tailored for institutions of higher education has led to many failures to produce meaningful, accessible, and timely information for decision making.

Also, to achieve the desired level of energy consumption awareness and efficiency improvements, energy use should be measured in more detail and linked to production data. In this scenario, real-time monitoring of energy consumption represents an essential step to increasing energy awareness, efficiency and the support of energy-aware production processes. This paper seeks to provide a way to achieve multi-level awareness of the energy used during production processes. The multi-level awareness of energy consumption means identifying the amount of energy used, CO<inf>2</inf> emitted, and the cost of the energy used at operation, product, and order level. This multi-level awareness is achieved by integrating energy usage data with production data at the operational level. Furthermore, energy sources need to be considered to define the amount of CO<inf>2</inf> that is emitted from the production process for each product. A pilot study was carried out to integrate electrical energy data, production data and scheduling data in real time to achieve the multi-level awareness of energy used in production. The results show that integrating energy with production data enables factories to provide specific energy consumption information for decision makers at the factory level, as well as for the consumers and the regulators. This integration of energy and production data is achieved efficiently when there is a high level of standardization of production processes and the availability of detailed energy usage data. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Big data architecture; Energy management; Multi-level energy awareness; Production monitoring; Smart metering; Software agent","Big data; Carbon dioxide; Data integration; Decision making; Energy management; Energy utilization; Information management; Power management; Software agents; Data architectures; Efficiency improvement; Energy awareness; Green manufacturing; Production monitoring; Real time monitoring; Smart metering; Specific energy consumption; Energy efficiency","","","","","","","Ahi, Payman, A comparative literature analysis of definitions for green and sustainable supply chain management, Journal of Cleaner Production, 52, pp. 329-341, (2013); Posselt, Gerrit, Energy monitoring in manufacturing companies - Generating Energy awareness through feedback, Leveraging Technology for a Sustainable World - Proceedings of the 19th CIRP Conference on Life Cycle Engineering, pp. 539-544, (2012); Brown, Adam J., Sustainable value stream mapping (Sus-VSM) in different manufacturing system configurations: Application case studies, Journal of Cleaner Production, 85, pp. 164-179, (2014); Bunse, Katharina, Integrating energy efficiency performance in production management - Gap analysis between industrial needs and scientific literature, Journal of Cleaner Production, 19, 6-7, pp. 667-679, (2011); Davis, James F., Smart manufacturing, manufacturing intelligence and demand-dynamic performance, Computers and Chemical Engineering, 47, pp. 145-156, (2012); Eco Management and Audit Scheme Emas, (2016); Faulkner, William, Sustainable Value Stream Mapping (Sus-VSM): Methodology to visualize and assess manufacturing sustainability performance, Journal of Cleaner Production, 85, pp. 8-18, (2014); Garetti, Marco, Sustainable manufacturing: Trends and research challenges, Production Planning and Control, 23, 2-3, pp. 83-104, (2012); Gesternova, (2015); Haller, Stephan, The Internet of things in an enterprise context, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 5468, pp. 14-28, (2009)","F.

Despite the fact that all information required for economic analysis is available from various sources, such data are very often useless for analysis from the point of view of their economic potential. The purpose of this study is to outline a foundation for integrating Business Intelligence and Big Data into economic analysis processes. The theoretical and methodological basis of this study is provided by scientific research, methodological and practical developments of domestic and foreign authors on the application of IT solutions in economic analysis. According to the results of the research, modern information technologies, in particular, the Business Intelligence and Big Data systems have considerably changed the possibilities for improving economic analysis and reducing decision-making time. From the methodological point of view, many aspects of integration of BI and Big Data solutions and their implementation in the economic analysis processes in Russia’s companies remain insufficiently developed. The foreign market of modern information technologies for business analytics has a longer history and is being developed more rapidly. The main conclusions of the study indicate that modern organizations operating on a highly competitive market should understand that the accumulation of Big Data does not always lead to the expected business benefits. In this context, the conclusion is that a modern company should not set as its goal to process all the available data in order to improve the quality of its economic analysis. It is more significant to use the entire volume of data for segmentation, which allows effective construction of a large number of models for small clusters, solving specific problems of economic analysis based on the application of modern IT systems. © 2020 Business Informatics.

Because of the growing volume, complexity and strategic importance of asset management data, it is no longer desirable or even feasible for each department/ unit/division/function within a utility to manage this data by itself, or to build its own data analytics capabilities. To get the most out of the new data resources, utilities are creating dedicated data groups that are potentially embedded within the core asset management program team to consolidate data collection, aggregation and analytics. Three trends have emerged in the data management realm - cloud computing, mobile computing, and explosion of data. Utilities are collecting more data than ever before. However, the challenge facing utilities is their inability to convert all the data into meaningful & usable information. Over the past year, self-service business intelligence tools have provided the necessary capabilities for utility staff to process and analyze data to produce meaningful insights. Advances in technology have revolutionized data and performance reporting so that users (with limited IT development expertise) can perform data mining and develop high impact visuals for performance reporting. Water and Wastewater Utilities are implementing Business Intelligence (BI) frameworks to track and report key asset management performance indicators and other data analytics. Benefits of this business intelligence reporting framework include: 1. Eliminates the reliance on core IT developers to develop and manage reporting frameworks as BI is now integrated with common applications, putting the non-IT user in a position to perform complex data analysis and develop aesthetically-pleasing visualizations 2. Significantly reduces development cost and level of effort 3. Through the concept of data ""lakes"", data models can be constructed using data from various sources (CMMS, GIS, SCADA, project management, financial and customer information systems) with ease 4. Eliminates the extensive costs and need for complex and disparate system integration that is typically required to connect data for effective performance reporting 5. Reduces the time to develop high impact visualizations to hours or days, rather than weeks, months, and years 6. Complete transferability to mobile devices for use at meetings and workshops This presentation will discuss the utility management business intelligence frameworks that have been implemented by utilities for effective integration, tracking and reporting of various data within their organization. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the value generated by implementing data management and business intelligence through data analytics and how business intelligence aligns with the 3 data trends (cloud, mobile, and explosion of data). © © 2017 Water Environment Federation.","Big Data; Business Intelligence; Cloud Computing; Data Analytics; Data Governance; Data Life Cycle; Data Management; Data-Driven Decision Making; Information Management; Mobile","Asset management; Big data; Cloud computing; Competitive intelligence; Data integration; Data mining; Decision making; Human resource management; Lakes; Life cycle; Mobile cloud computing; Project management; SCADA systems; Visualization; Data analytics; Data driven decision; Data governances; Data life cycle; Mobile; Information management","","","","","","","","A.

However there are few solutions that support monitoring and decision-making in operating room management. But with new data sources and analytical methods of big data research more improvements could be achieved. In this work we utilize surgical phase events recognized in surgical device data to learn prediction models and trigger online predictions for remaining intervention times in operating rooms. To identify the best algorithm for prediction model computation with the existing data, we evaluate a set of regression algorithms. Based on this methods we propose an architecture approach for the integrated processing of real-time data and historic learning data. The evaluation and comparison with related work shows that our prototype is competitive regarding prediction accuracy.

As a response to the inability of organizations to process large quantities and varieties of data, in the technological market, arise the Big Data. This emerging concept defined mainly by the volume, velocity and variety has evolved greatly in part by its ability to generate value for organizations in decision making. Currently, the health care sector is one of the five sectors of activity where the potential of Big Data growth most stands out. However, the way to go is still long and in fact there are few organizations, related to health care, that are taking advantage of the true potential of Big Data. The main target of this research is to produce a real-time Big Data architecture to the INTCare system, of the Centro Hospitalar do Porto, using the main open source big data solution, the Apache Hadoop.

Many are adopting big data technologies - but, without the right strategy, architecture, and tools, they are finding that data lakes can quickly become data swamps. Today, businesses must evolve to maximize the value of unprecedented amounts of data. Strong business intelligence and analytics capabilities, as well as effective reporting and visualization tools, provide businesses with reliable data that is critical to responding quickly to fast-moving market trends and customer demands. Quickly finding answers to business problems is challenging. Massive volumes of data constantly arrive at high speed, making it difficult to manage and analyze. While big data solutions can help, many businesses lack the experience to implement and manage them. Many organizations are inundated with data that they can’t seem to organize, understand, or convert to useful information. That can lead to unreliable reporting and poor decision-making.The need for data governance has been recognized but still many companies are finding the establishment of data origin challenging. It is also challenging to define who can access the data, what can be done with the data and how to manage the data. © INDIACom-2017.","Analytics; Big data; Data center","Data centers; Data visualization; Decision making; Information management; Information use; Visual analytics; Analytic; Business analytics; Business problems; Business-intelligence; Customer demands; Data technologies; Datacenter; Market trends; Reporting tools; Visualization tools; Big data","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","11th INDIACom; 4th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development, INDIACom 2017","2017-03-01 through 2017-03-03","New Delhi","209820","","9789380544243","","","English","INDIACom; Int.

Some of the limited recourses are electricity, water, drainage and transportation. This condition of scarcity of limited resources gives rise to need of smart city technologies. In order to manage these limited resources more effectively we need relevant data to manage these resources and take efficient decisions. The data needed usually is of high velocity nature and are form different sensors across the city. The data produced from these sensors if stored in a data base will not only consume high amount of memory but also becomes useless if it is not used in real time applications. The aim of this paper is to compare such big data architectures that focus on the ways to collect, process the data and enable fast decision making in a smart city context. Materials and Methods: The contents of the paper includes the literature review of smart sensing using optical sensors to give users a basic understanding of how data in a smart city is collected and then monitored in real time. The paper also provides review of two architectures (BASIS and CIDAP) focusing on its functionalities and usage criteria. Conclusions: The paper presents a comparative analysis of BASIS and CIDAP architectures highlighting its strengths, limitations and applicability. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

Due to technical and economical progress an ever increasing number of data sources are available leading to a rapidly growing fast and unreliable amount of data that can be beneficial (1) in the approximation of multivariate and causal predictions of future values as well as (2) in robust and proactive decisionmaking processes. However, today's GIS are not designed for such big data demands and require new methodologies to effectively model uncertainty and generate meaningful knowledge. As a consequence, we introduce BigGIS, a predictive and prescriptive spatio-temporal analytics platform, that symbiotically combines big data analytics, semantic web technologies and visual analytics methodologies.

When certain characteristics define this data such as volume refers to a large quantity of data received and stored; velocity refers to a high speed of receiving data from different data streams; variety involves the ever-changing data formats from new services, and new data types that are being captured; and finally that this data is valuable. Any data characterized by the aforementioned characteristics is articulated as big data and the systems managing such data is referred to as Big Data Systems (BDSs). Mobile service providers (MSPs) in their efforts to provide more efficient heterogeneous networks (HetNets) deal daily with data characterized by the same features. The successful implementation of a BDS involves having the required infrastructure in place to process the data. There are three key areas involved with a big data infrastructure which includes data acquisition, data organization, and data analysis. Since big data involves higher velocity, volume, and variety an organization must have the ability to capture this data. MSPs need to employ a system to actually extract and analyze network utilization big data to determine if it brings value to them and their customers. This work discusses the design, implementation and utilization aspects of a Hadoop system that can help MSPs to delve deep into their big data stores to analyze the potential of adding value to the organization. A Hadoop system would allow an entity to organize and process their big data. A system architecture for the BDS supporting the HetNet operations will be proposed together with the recommendations of an analytics framework. The BDS architecture together with the analytics framework aims at helping the MSPs in forecasting the network traffic. The results of the traffic big data analytics and the network load forecasting can be used to adjust different network operating parameters. These adjustments can definitely enhance the HetNet performance. The proposed big data architecture and the analytics framework proposed in this study will be used as a decision support system component in an educational and research pilot project that aims at introducing the role of big data analytics in guiding the self-healing process used in cellular self-organized networks. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","Big data; Hadoop; HetNets; Self-organized networks (SON)","","","","","","(1337787); Syracuse University, SU; Københavns Universitet, KU","The authors are grateful for support provided through NSF MRI grant 1337787 and Syracuse University, which enabled us to establish the core facility on campus and continues to provide support for its operation.

First, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are usually applied to represent and reason about existing clinical knowledge, but also to discover new one from raw data. Second, at a global decision level, representative applications of Business Intelligence (BI) must be also considered. The present work introduces the design and implementation of a CDSS platform that integrates both AI and BI technologies to assist clinicians in the rational use of antibiotics in a hospital. The choice of a Hadoop based Big Data architecture provides a suitable solution for the problem of integrating, processing and analysing large sets of clinical data. The platform facilitates the daily follow-up of antibiotic therapies and infections while offering various decision support modules at both patient and global level.

In particular, data from social media are seen as interesting as they can, when properly treated, assist in achieving customer insight into business decision making. However, the unstructured and uncertain nature of this kind of big data presents a new kind of challenge: how to evaluate the quality of data and manage the value of data within a big data architecture? This paper contributes to addressing this challenge by introducing a new architectural solution to evaluate and manage the quality of social media data in each processing phase of the big data pipeline. The proposed solution improves business decision making by providing real-time, validated data for the user. The solution is validated with an industrial case example, in which the customer insight is extracted from social media data in order to determine the customer satisfaction regarding the quality of a product. © 2013 IEEE.","Big data; Computer architecture; Meta data; Online services; Social network services","Computer architecture; Customer satisfaction; Data handling; Decision making; Information management; Metadata; Network architecture; Quality control; Sales; Social networking (online); Architectural solutions; Business decisions; Customer insights; On-line service; Quality of data; Social media; Social media datum; Social network services; Big data","","","","","","","Auer, Sören, DBpedia: A nucleus for a Web of open data, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 4825 LNCS, pp. 722-735, (2007); Immonen, Anne, Requirements of an open data based business ecosystem, IEEE Access, 2, pp. 88-103, (2014); Bhatia, Sumit, Monitoring and analyzing customer feedback through social media platforms for identifying and remedying customer problems, Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2013, pp. 1147-1154, (2013); Antunes, Francisco, Integrating decision support and social networks, Advances in Human-Computer Interaction, 2012, (2012); Fabijan, Aleksander, Customer feedback and data collection techniques in software R&D: A literature review, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 210, pp. 139-153, (2015); Ferrando-Llopis, Roman, Advancing value creation and value capture in data-intensive contexts, Proceedings - 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2013, pp. 5-9, (2013); Pääkkönen, Pekka, Reference Architecture and Classification of Technologies, Products and Services for Big Data Systems, Big Data Research, 2, 4, pp. 166-186, (2015); Madnick, Stuart E., Overview and framework for Data and information quality research, Journal of Data and Information Quality, 1, 1, (2009); Wang, Richard Y., Beyond accuracy: What data quality means to data consumers, Journal of Management Information Systems, 12, 4, pp. 5-34, (1996); International Conference on Computer Applications and Network Security Iccans, (2011)","A.

At the same time, advances in computing, storage, communication, and big data technologies are making it possible to collect, store, process, analyze and visualize enormous volumes of data at scale and at speed. The convergence of Operations Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT), powered by innovative data analytics, holds the promise of using insights derived from these rich types of data to better manage our systems, resources, environment, health, social infrastructure, and industrial operations. Opportunities to apply innovative analytics abound in many industries (e.g., manufacturing, power distribution, oil and gas exploration and production, telecommunication, healthcare, agriculture, mining) and similarly in government (e.g., homeland security, smart cities, public transportation, accountable care). In developing several such applications over the years, we have come to realize that existing benchmarks for decision support, streaming data, event processing, or distributed processing are not adequate for industrial big data applications. One primary reason being that these benchmarks individually address narrow range of data and analytics processing needs of industrial big data applications. In this paper, we outline an approach we are taking to defining a benchmark that is motivated by typical industrial operations scenarios. We describe the main issues we are considering for the benchmark, including the typical data and processing requirements; representative queries and analytics operations over streaming and stored, structured and unstructured data; and the proposed simulator data architecture. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Benchmarking; Data handling; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Information management; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum transportation; Big data applications; Data architectures; Distributed processing; Industrial operations; Oil and gas exploration; Power distributions; Public transportation; Social infrastructure; Big data","","","","","","","Abouzied, Azza, HadoopDB in action: Building real world applications, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1111-1113, (2010); Baru, Chaitanya, Discussion of bigbench: A proposed industry standard performance benchmark for big data, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 8904, pp. 44-63, (2015); Baru, Chaitanya, Benchmarking Big Data Systems and the BigData Top100 List, Big Data, 1, 1, pp. 60-64, (2013); Chowdhury, Badrul, A bigbench implementation in the hadoop ecosystem, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 8585, pp. 3-18, (2014); Tpcx Hs, (2015); Floratou, Avrilia, SQL-on-Hadoop: Full circle back to shared-nothing database architectures, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 7, 12, pp. 1295-1306, (2014); Ghazal, Ahmad, BigBench: Towards an industry standard benchmark for big data analytics, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1197-1208, (2013); Han, Rui, On big data benchmarking, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 8807, pp. 3-18, (2014); Huang, Shengsheng, The HiBench benchmark suite: Characterization of the MapReduce-based data analysis, Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 41-51, (2010); Othayoth, Raghunath K., The Making of TPC-DS, VLDB 2006 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 1049-1058, (2006)","U.

In this article, we take a close look at the unique challenges in building such a network infrastructure for big data. Our study covers each and every segment in this network highway: the access networks that connect data sources, the Internet backbone that bridges them to remote data centers, as well as the dedicated network among data centers and within a data center. We also present two case studies of real-world big data applications that are empowered by networking, highlighting interesting and promising future research directions. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","","Computer networks; Hardware; Access network; Big data applications; Dedicated networks; Future research directions; Internet backbone; Network infrastructure; Remote data centers; Voluminous data; Big data","","","","","","","Proc Acm18th Annu Int Conf Mobile Comput Netw, (2012); Proc ACM Mobicom, (2012); Liu, Fangming, Gearing resource-poor mobile devices with powerful clouds: Architectures, challenges, and applications, IEEE Wireless Communications, 20, 3, pp. 14-21, (2013); Xu, Yin, MPath: High-bandwidth data transfers with massively multipath source routing, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 24, 10, pp. 2046-2059, (2013); Proc ACM Eurosys, (2010); Proc ACM Conext, (2012); Liu, Xi, A case for a coordinated internet video control plane, SIGCOMM'12 - Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2012 Conference Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication, pp. 359-370, (2012); Proc ACM Conext, (2012); Al-Fares, Mohammad S., Hedera: Dynamic flow scheduling for data center networks, Proceedings of NSDI 2010: 7th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, pp. 281-295, (2010); Presented as Part of the 5th Usenix Workshop on Hot Topics in Cloud Computing, (2013)","F.

As advances in High-Level fusion using Multi-Int data have been made, the original concept of databases as a static repository of Level 0/1 content has evolved to support heterogeneous data, and as a necessary enabler of High-Level fusion processes. Relatively recent database technologies now support specialized storage for complex content such as multi-media, geospatial, and semantic data types. Additionally, database functionality has been extended from what was once almost exclusively storage and retrieval, to include integrated forensic and predictive algorithms, as well as decision support frameworks such as the data cube. These data mining capabilities provide a rich tool-set from which to tailor a fusion application. However, due to their inherent trade-off space, they present a significant design and integration challenge when implementing an enterprise architecture, which has to provide a comprehensive and cohesive framework across the entire fusion workflow, and which has to meet the needs of various Communities-of- Interest. This paper expounds on the role of data architecture as a key discipline to help analyze and synthesize an enterprise fusion system-of-systems, and presents selected principles to maximize heterogeneous data exploitation. © 2012 ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi).","Data Analytics; Data Mining; High-Level Fusion","Data analytics; Data architectures; Data cube; Database technology; Decision support framework; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise data; Fusion applications; Fusion process; Geo-spatial; Heterogeneous data; Integral components; JDL model; Multi-Media; Predictive algorithms; Semantic data; Storage and retrievals; System-of-systems; Data fusion; Data mining; Database systems; Decision support systems; Industry; Information fusion; Digital storage","","","","","","","Llinas, James, Revisiting the JDL data fusion model II, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION 2004, 2, pp. 1218-1230, (2004); Waltz, Ed L., Information understanding: Integrating data fusion and data mining processes, Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 6, pp. 553-556, (1998); Solano, Marco Antonio, High-Level fusion for intelligence applications using Recombinant Cognition Synthesis, Information Fusion, 13, 1, pp. 79-98, (2012); Gustavsson, Per M., The road towards multi-hypothesis intention simulation agents architecture fractal information fusion modeling, Proceedings - Winter Simulation Conference, 2005, pp. 2532-2541, (2005); Salerno, John J., Where's level 2/3 fusion - A look back over the past 10 years, FUSION 2007 - 2007 10th International Conference on Information Fusion, (2007); Salerno, John J., Knowledge representation requirements for situation awareness, 2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION, 1, pp. 26-29, (2005); Salerno, John J., Building a framework for situation awareness, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION 2004, 1, pp. 219-226, (2004); Defense Intelligence Journal, (2005); McCue, Colleen Mc Laughlin, Data mining and predictive analysis: Intelligence gathering and crime analysis, Data Mining and Predictive Analysis: Intelligence Gathering and Crime Analysis, pp. 1-368, (2006); Blasch, Erik Philip, Level 5 (user refinement) issues supporting information fusion management, 2006 9th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION, (2006)","M.A. Solano; Space and Airborne Systems, Raytheon, Dallas, TX, United States; email: marco_a_solano@raytheon.com","","","","15th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION 2012","","","","","9780982443859","","","English","Int.
