In financial modeling, relational databases, big data systems, and the cloud are integrated, taking into consideration resource optimization and sustainable computing. We suggest a four-layer architecture to address financial data processing issues. The layers of our design are for data sources, data integration, processing, and storage. Data ingestion processes market feeds, transaction records, and customer data. Real-time data are captured by Kafka and transformed by Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipelines. The processing layer is composed of Apache Spark for real-time data analysis, Hadoop for batch processing, and an Machine Learning (ML) infrastructure that supports predictive modeling. In order to optimize access patterns, the storage layer includes various data layer components. The test results indicate that the processing of market data in real-time, compliance reporting, risk evaluations, and customer analyses can be conducted in fulfillment of environmental sustainability goals. The metrics from the test deployment support the implementation strategies and technical specifications of the architectural components. We also looked at integration models and data flow improvements, with applications in finance. This study aims to enhance enterprise data architecture in the financial context and includes guidance on modernizing data infrastructure. © 2025 by the authors.","big data; financial systems; hybrid storage systems; integration; multi-tier architecture","Financial data processing; Data architectures; Data systems; Energy impact; Financial institution; Financial modeling; Financial system; Hybrid storage systems; Multi tier architecture; Relational Database; Resources optimization; Relational database systems","","","","","Association for Social Economics, ASE","This paper was co-financed by The Bucharest University of Economic Studies (ASE) during the PhD program.","Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr, The contagion effect of artificial intelligence across innovative industries: From blockchain and metaverse to cleantech and beyond, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 210, (2025); Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas, Revolutionizing finance: The synergy of fintech, digital adoption, and innovation, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 200, (2024); GÄsiorkiewicz, Lech, Introduction, Digital Finance and the Future of the Global Financial System: Disruption and Innovation in Financial Services, pp. 1-10, (2022); Ionescu, Sergiu Alexandru, Transforming Financial Decision-Making: The Interplay of AI, Cloud Computing and Advanced Data Management Technologies, International Journal of Computers, Communications and Control, 18, 6, pp. 1-19, (2023); Computer Science IT Research Journal, (2024); Abis, Danilo, FinTech and consumers: a systematic review and integrative framework, Management Decision, 63, 1, pp. 49-75, (2025); Ren, Xiangying, Research on Financial Investment Decision Based on Cloud Model and Hybrid Drosophila Algorithm Optimization, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, (2021); Sharma, Ratnesh Kumar, Thematic Analysis of Big Data in Financial Institutions Using NLP Techniques with a Cloud Computing Perspective: A Systematic Literature Review, Information (Switzerland), 14, 10, (2023); Ionescu, Sergiu Alexandru, Assessment and Integration of Relational Databases, Big Data, and Cloud Computing in Financial Institutions: Performance Comparison, 18th International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications, INISTA 2024, (2024); Database Management Trends in 2020, (2020)","V.

This study proposes a framework based on 'big data lake-semantic layer-intelligent algorithm' to achieve real-time and interpretable financial risk monitoring. Through the multi-modal risk representation combined with the hybrid flow-batch pipeline and knowledge graph, the real-time synchronization of risk scoring and response strategy is realized by using a state machine-driven feedback loop and adaptive threshold adjustment. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the framework is improved by more than 10%, the false alarm rate is reduced to 1.8%, and the response time is shortened to 250 milliseconds.

Traditional data management approaches may struggle to handle the large, diverse, and rapidly updating datasets prevalent in modern clinical environments. Objective: This study aimed to compare 3 clinical data management architectures—clinical data warehouses, clinical data lakes, and clinical data lakehouses—by analyzing their performance using the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles and the big data 5 V’s (volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value). The aim was to provide guidance on selecting an architecture that balances robust data governance with the flexibility required for advanced analytics. Methods: We developed a comprehensive analysis framework that integrates aspects of data governance with technical performance criteria. A rapid literature review was conducted to synthesize evidence from multiple studies, focusing on how each architecture manages large, heterogeneous, and dynamically updating clinical data. The review assessed key dimensions such as scalability, real-time processing capabilities, metadata consistency, and the technical expertise required for implementation and maintenance. Results: The results show that clinical data warehouses offer strong data governance, stability, and structured reporting, making them well suited for environments that require strict compliance and reliable analysis. However, they are limited in terms of real-time processing and scalability. In contrast, clinical data lakes offer greater flexibility and cost-effective scalability for managing heterogeneous data types, although they may suffer from inconsistent metadata management and challenges in maintaining data quality. Clinical data lakehouses combine the strengths of both approaches by supporting real-time data ingestion and structured querying; however, their hybrid nature requires high technical expertise and involves complex integration efforts. Conclusions: The optimal data management architecture for clinical applications depends on an organization’s specific needs, available resources, and strategic goals. Health care institutions need to weigh the trade-offs between robust data governance, operational flexibility, and scalability to build future-proof infrastructures that support both clinical operations and artificial intelligence research. Further research should focus on simplifying the complexity of hybrid models and improving the integration of clinical standards to improve overall system reliability and ease of implementation. ©Richard Gebler, Ines Reinecke, Martin Sedlmayr, Miriam Goldammer.","big data in health care; clinical data management; data architecture evaluation; data lake; data lakehouse; data warehouse","Article; artificial intelligence; batch process; big data; clinical study; cloud computing; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; data accuracy; data base; data integrity; data processing; data quality; data source; data warehouse; electronic health record; health care; health data; human; information processing; infrastructure; metadata; patient-reported outcome; whole genome sequencing; comparative study; Artificial Intelligence; Data Management; Humans","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01KX2121)","This publication was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) Network of University Medicine 2.0: \u201CNUM 2.0\u201D (grant 01KX2121, Project: Netzwerk der Datenintegrationszentren der Universit\u00E4tsmedizin).","Shilo, Smadar, Axes of a revolution: challenges and promises of big data in healthcare, Nature Medicine, 26, 1, pp. 29-38, (2020); Baloch, Laila, A Review of Big Data Trends and Challenges in Healthcare, International Journal of Technology, 14, 6, pp. 1320-1333, (2023); undefined; Mendhe, Dinesh, AI-Enabled Data-Driven Approaches for Personalized Medicine and Healthcare Analytics, Proceedings of 9th International Conference on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics: The Role of Emerging Technologies in Digital Transformation, ICONSTEM 2024, (2024); Schwabe, Daniel, The METRIC-framework for assessing data quality for trustworthy AI in medicine: a systematic review, npj Digital Medicine, 7, 1, (2024); Mandl, Kenneth D., Integration of AI in healthcare requires an interoperable digital data ecosystem, Nature Medicine, 30, 3, pp. 631-634, (2024); Pavlenko, Elena, Implementation of data access and use procedures in clinical data warehouses.

Existing ETL systems struggle with performance, scalability, and adaptability, making it difficult to handle the rising demands of both batch and real-time data processing. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Hybrid ETL Infrastructure that combines contextual data partitioning with AI-driven orchestration to optimize data ingestion and real-time analysis in information lakehouses. The system addresses key issues, such as inefficient data handling, slow processing times, and inadequate transformation methods, by dynamically adjusting the ETL pipeline based on user requests, context-aware partitioning, and data characteristics. The AI-driven orchestration ensures efficient job scheduling by seamlessly switching between batch and real-time processing based on data importance, thereby improving both performance and flexibility. Contextual partitioning reduces processing costs and enhances query performance by automatically organizing data according to domain-specific knowledge and query intent. The primary goal of this framework is to improve data transformation and loading performance in information lakehouses, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making. Preliminary results show a 30% reduction in ETL processing time and significant improvements in query efficiency and accuracy, particularly in complex, cross-domain data retrieval environments. The proposed approach offers a scalable, adaptable, and intelligent solution for modern data lakehouse scenarios, outperforming traditional ETL methods. © 2025 IEEE.","AI-Driven Orchestration; Batch Processing; Contextual Data Partitioning; Data Ingestion; Data Lakehouse; Data Transformation; Hybrid ETL Framework; Query Optimization; Real-Time Processing; Scalable Data Architecture","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Data accuracy; Data handling; Decision making; Information retrieval; Lakes; Metadata; Query processing; Real time systems; AI-driven orchestration; Batch processing; Contextual data partitioning; Data architectures; Data ingestions; Data lakehouse; Data partitioning; Data transformation; Extract transform loads; Hybrid extract, transform, load framework; Queries optimization; Realtime processing; Scalable data architecture; Batch data processing","","","","","","","Armbrust, Michael, Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics, 11th Annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, CIDR 2021, (2021); Data Lakehouse Evolution and Convergence of Data Lakes and Data Warehouses, (2022); Journal of Data Engineering, (2023); Databricks Whitepaper, (2022); Journal of Advanced Computing, (2022); IEEE Cloud Computing Journal, (2022); ACM Digital Library, (2023); Data Management Review, (2022); Information Systems Journal, (2023); Ieeetransactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, (2022)","K.

However, the recent pandemic and the subsequent post-pandemic period have underscored the diverse needs facing industries today, from addressing supply chain challenges to adapting to hybrid work cultures. Additionally, the recent surge in generative AI has steered companies toward the development of enterprise data platforms. This shift underscores the urgent need to harness data more effectively, empowering businesses to navigate the evolving landscape and tackle these critical challenges. However, recent research in this direction—aiming to develop economical, timely, and scalable data platforms—has been notably scarce. This research presents the development of a scalable, cost-effective, and time-efficient data platform designed to support various data domains such as Data Analytics, Marketing, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. Utilizing a case study with a simulation within a real-world organizational context, in the practical organizational setting of over the past four years, we integrated data into a central Lakehouse using Spark Delta to assess the platform’s capabilities. We have collected data using metadata-driven ingestion patterns using near real-time, batch, and Application programming interface (API). The platform leverages advanced technologies like Spark, Databricks, Kafka, Power BI, and cloud infrastructure to meet the high-performance demands of data management and analysis. The implementation results revealed the platform’s proficiency in processing data, performing intelligent analytics, and generating actionable insights efficiently. Its cost-effectiveness and impressive performance outcomes highlight the platform’s potential as an invaluable resource for organizations optimizing data assets. This platform also builds in short duration. This paper details the design, implementation, and benefits of our proposed data platform, illustrating its significance as a robust solution for enterprises leveraging data-driven decision-making.

The common weakness of these platforms, however, lies in the difficulty of controlling learners' behaviour. Noone can know for certain whether the level of engagement during learning is sufficient for learners to fully grasp the knowledge, or whether learners may fail to complete the courses they have enrolled in, leading to dropout behaviour. In this study, we also ap-plied an artificial intelligence model to predict whether current students can complete the course, enabling quick detection of dropout behaviour and timely preventive measures. Based on the proposed architecture, a real-time monitoring, analysis, and management application system for learner behavior can be developed. This empowers course managers to detect which learners might drop out of which courses, enabling timely alerts to learners for adjusting their study plans or, on a broader scale, restructuring the organization of courses with excessively high dropout rates.

Among them, data lakehouses are receiving much interest from industrial and academic fields due to their ability to hold disparate multi-structured batch and streaming data sources in a single data repository. Thus, the heterogeneous and complex aspect of the data requires a dedicated process to improve their quality and retrieve value from them. Therefore, data curation encompasses several tasks that clean and enrich data to ensure it continues to fit the user requirements. Nevertheless, most existing data curation approaches need more dynamics, flexibility, and customization in constituting the data curation pipeline to align with end user requirements that may vary according to her/his decision context. Moreover, they are dedicated to curating only a single type of structure of batch data sources (e.g., semi-structured). Considering the changing requirements of the user and the need to build a customized data curation pipeline according to the users and the data source characteristics, we propose a service-based framework for adaptive data curation in data lakehouses that encompasses five modules: data collection, data quality evaluation, data characterization, curation service composition, and data curation. The proposed framework is built upon new data characterization and evaluation modular ontology and a curation service composition approach that we detail in the following paper. The experimental findings validate the contributions’ performance in terms of effectiveness and execution time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data curation; Data Lakehouse; Machine Learning; Reinforcement Learning; Service composition","Data acquisition; Information management; Pipelines; Quality control; Quality of service; Semantics; Batch data; Curation; Data characterization; Data curation; Data lakehouse; Data-source; Machine-learning; Reinforcement learnings; Service-based; Services composition; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","The authors would like to thank Dr. Fatma Guermazi, an oncology physician at Léon-Bérard Center, Lyon, France, for agreeing to validate the effectiveness of the medical enrichment proposed by our data curation approach.","Hlupić, Tomislav, An Overview of Current Data Lake Architecture Models, 2022 45th Jubilee International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology, MIPRO 2022 - Proceedings, pp. 1082-1087, (2022); From Data Deluge to Data Curation, (2004); Akoka, Jacky, Research on Big Data – A systematic mapping study, Computer Standards and Interfaces, 54, pp. 105-115, (2017); Tempini, Niccolò, Data curation-research: practices of data standardization and exploration in a precision medicine database, New Genetics and Society, 40, 1, pp. 73-94, (2021); Behehsti, Amin, CrowdCorrect: A curation pipeline for social data cleansing and curation, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 317, pp. 24-38, (2018); Konstantinou, Nikolaos, VADA: an architecture for end user informed data preparation, Journal of Big Data, 6, 1, (2019); MacCioni, Antonio, KAYAK: A framework for just-in-time data preparation in a data lake, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 10816 LNCS, pp. 474-489, (2018); Bellomarini, Luigi, Data science with Vadalog: Knowledge Graphs with machine learning and reasoning in practice, Future Generation Computer Systems, 129, pp. 407-422, (2022); Debattista, Jeremy, Daq, an ontology for dataset quality information, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 1184, (2014); Prov O the Prov Ontology, (2013)","F.

The productivity and quality of manual manufacturing work heavily depend on the skill level of the operators. Therefore, changes in manufacturing input factors can be determined by analyzing the pattern change of power sources such as electricity and pneumatic energy consumed in work-aid tools or semi-automatic facilities used by skilled operators. The manual workflow can be optimized by modeling this pattern and the image information of the operator and analyzing it in real time. Machine learning operations (MLOps) technology is required to respond to rapid changes in production systems and facilities and work patterns that frequently occur in small-batch production methods. MLOps can selectively configure Kubeflow, the MLOps solution, and the data lake based on Kubernetes for the entire process, from collecting and analyzing data to learning and deploying ML models, enabling the provision of fast and differentiated services from model development to distribution by the scale and construction stage of the manufacturing site.

Furthermore, there is a need to reduce the gap on time from when information is created to when actions and insights can be offered. However, a challenge in implementing a large-scale data processing architecture is deciding which tools are appropriate, and how to apply them in the best way possible. For example, streaming systems are now mature enough that hospitals worldwide can use their extremely large datasets, along with data producers, to predict and influence future events. Thus, the main objective of this systematic review is to identify the state-of-the-art in data platforms on healthcare that allow the creation of metrics and actions in real-time. The PRISMA guideline for reporting systematic reviews was implemented to deliver a transparent and consistent report, validating the technological advances in a critical sector. Multiple pertinent articles and papers were retrieved from the SCOPUS abstract and citation database on May 13, 2022, using several relevant keywords to identify potentially relevant documents published from January 2020 onward. These documents must have already been published in English and been already published, and accessible through the B-ON consortium that allows Portuguese students to legally download from most publishers. Over seven studies have been selected for deeper discussion based on their relevance and impact for this review, showcasing their main objectives, data sources, and tools used, as well as their approaches for interoperability and support of machine learning algorithms for decision support. In closing, the collected articles have shown that while Big Data is currently in use at health institutions of all sizes, the ability of processing large amounts of data from sensors and events, and notifying stakeholders as quickly as possible is still in its infancy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

Big data helps machine learning algorithms better timely and accurate recommendations than ever before. Machine learning big data phases and subsystems point the way to comparable issues and threats, as well as to associated research in various of previously new of unexplored areas. In latest days, data stream mining has become a popular research topic. The biggest challenge in streaming data mining is extracting important information directly from a vast, persistent, and changeable data stream in just one scan. Clustering is a powerful method for resolving this issue. Financial transactions, electronic communications, and other fields can benefit from data stream clustering. This research examines approaches for synthesizing enormous data streams, including projection clusters for high-dimensional data, scalability, and spreading computing, as well as the issues of big data and machine learning. The data abstraction and regular features of learning streams, such as abstraction wander, data flow system, and outlier observation, are discussed in this study. AutoCloud, which seems supported by previous inform prospect of typicality with eccentricity data science, will be used to discover deviations but instead resolve them using the support clustering approach, which is the process of computing difficulty and clustering exactness, will be detailed in this article. We present the MLAutoCloud algorithm, which will be used in machine learning PySpark frameworks.

This paper describes a major advancement in blow-out preventor (BOP) integrity management resulting from the compounding impact of integrated leading-edge technologies developed through cross-industry collaboration. BOP integrity management has been transformed by combining novel technologies and integrating multiple data sets over the past two years. The foundation is advanced analyses and rigorous pressure testing criteria developed through big data analytics incorporating over 210,000 tests. This data is now live-streamed from rig-site to relevant stakeholders through a cloud-based platform. Digital BOP control monitoring now also allows for real-time streaming, alerts, and notifications in addition to generating a massive amount of data. Cloud-based digital assurance workflows allow stakeholders access to real-time information as operations evolve ensuring access to latest plans and results. This digital data may be added to the end-user's data lakes, achieved through open architecture, and automated connectivity through APIs (application programing interfaces). Simple digital pressure testing alternatives lack an extensive database developed over 12 years which provides research insight. This extensive database has led to significant advances in test validation algorithms efficiency and robustness beyond industry standard validation criteria. Utilizing advanced algorithms to verify BOP integrity provides the highest levels of well barrier assurance. Linking rig-site BOP testing and control system monitoring through a cloud-based application allows for live-streaming, connecting subject matter experts (SMEs) around the globe for efficient troubleshooting and sharing of best practices. Rig-site testing and maintenance data is visible in cloud-based key performance indicators (KPI) dashboards, making performance visible to optimize efficiency, accelerate learnings and increase uptime. The combination of BOP control monitoring data with pressure testing has generated large databases that are in the initial stages of developing machine learning and artificial intelligence technology. This will enable data-driven performance-based frequency testing and condition-based maintenance. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference.

Such data streams need to be processed online to deal with critical business applications such as real-time fraud detection, network security attack prevention or predictive maintenance on information system infrastructure. Many algorithms have been proposed for data stream learning, however, most of them do not deal with the important challenges and constraints imposed by real-world applications. In particular, when we need to train models incrementally from heterogeneous data mining and deployment them within complex big data architecture. Based on banking applications and lessons learned in production environments of BNP Paribas - a major international banking group and leader in the Eurozone - we identified the most important current challenges for mining IT data streams. Our goal is to highlight the key challenges faced by data scientists and data engineers within complex industry settings for building or deploying models for real word streaming applications. We provide future research directions on Stream Learning that will accelerate the adoption of online learning models for solving real-word problems. Therefore bridging the gap between research and industry communities. Finally, we provide some recommendations to tackle some of these challenges. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Banking; Challenges; IT; Production; Streaming","Complex networks; Data mining; Industrial research; Information use; Machine learning; Network security; Banking industry; Business applications; Challenge; Critical business; Data stream; Event logs; IT; Machine-learning; Streaming; Times series; Information systems","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; Du, Min, DeepLog: Anomaly detection and diagnosis from system logs through deep learning, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 1285-1298, (2017); undefined; ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, (2013); undefined; undefined; He, Pinjia, Drain: An Online Log Parsing Approach with Fixed Depth Tree, Proceedings - 2017 IEEE 24th International Conference on Web Services, ICWS 2017, pp. 33-40, (2017); A Survey on Automated Log Analysis for Reliability Engineering, (2020); Online Learning A Comprehensive Survey, (2018)","A.

You will learn about data virtualization and data lakes for this complete artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) platform within the SQL Server database engine. You will know how to use Big Data Clusters to combine large volumes of streaming data for analysis along with data stored in a traditional database. For example, you can stream large volumes of data from Apache Spark in real time while executing Transact-SQL queries to bring in relevant additional data from your corporate, SQL Server database. Filled with clear examples and use cases, this book provides everything necessary to get started working with Big Data Clusters in SQL Server 2019. You will learn about the architectural foundations that are made up from Kubernetes, Spark, HDFS, and SQL Server on Linux. You then are shown how to configure and deploy Big Data Clusters in on-premises environments or in the cloud. Next, you are taught about querying. You will learn to write queries in Transact-SQL-taking advantage of skills you have honed for years-and with those queries you will be able to examine and analyze data from a wide variety of sources such as Apache Spark. Through the theoretical foundation provided in this book and easy-to-follow example scripts and notebooks, you will be ready to use and unveil the full potential of SQL Server 2019: combining different types of data spread across widely disparate sources into a single view that is useful for business intelligence and machine learning analysis. What You Will Learn • Install, manage, and troubleshoot Big Data Clusters in cloud or on-premise environments • Analyze large volumes of data directly from SQL Server and/or Apache Spark • Manage data stored in HDFS from SQL Server as if it were relational data • Implement advanced analytics solutions through machine learning and AI • Expose different data sources as a single logical source using data virtualization Who This Book Is For Data engineers, data scientists, data architects, and database administrators who want to employ data virtualization and big data analytics in their environments © 2020 by Benjamin Weissman and Enrico van de Laar.

In recent years, the rise of big data technology has provided new ideas for pipeline integrity evaluation technology. Firstly, this paper systematically studies the key technologies related to the lifetime analysis of oil and gas pipelines and big data. Meanwhile, we also studies the next generation oil and gas pipeline big data system architecture, the development direction of big data architecture tends to be batch-stream unified and integrated. We completes the model establishment process from theoretical derivation, algorithm design and gives the key algorithm steps to accurately predict the pipeline inspection period. From the results, in the single models the minimum risk decision based on Naive Bayes is the best, the accuracy rate is 91.86%, and in the ensemble model the accuracy of GBDT is slightly better than that of the random forest, which accuracy rate reached 99.7%. In contrast, the ensemble learning method has a much better dataset fitting performance, which provides an idea for the selection of the algorithm in engineering applications. © 2019 IEEE.","big data; ensemble learning; machine learning; pipeline integrity; remaining life prediction","Big data; Data streams; Decision trees; Engineering education; Learning systems; Development directions; Engineering applications; Ensemble learning; Minimum risk decisions; Oil-and-Gas pipelines; Pipeline integrity; Remaining life prediction; Theoretical derivations; Pipelines","","","","","PetroChina Innovation Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFC0303706, 2017YFC0805803); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Funding text 1: 2017D-5007-0602), the China National Key Research and Development Plan (Grant No. 2017YFC0805803 and 2016YFC0303706).; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge gratefully financial support provided by PetroChina Innpvation Foundation(Grant No.","Caleyo, Francisco, A study on the reliability assessment methodology for pipelines with active corrosion defects, International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping, 79, 1, pp. 77-86, (2002); Valor, Alma R., Reliability assessment of buried pipelines based on different corrosion rate models, Corrosion Science, 66, pp. 78-87, (2013); Meta Group Research Note, (2001); Expanding Digital Universe A Forecast of Worldwide Information Growth Through 2010, (2007); Oil Gas Storage and Transpor Tation, (2014); Oil Gas Storage and Transportation, (2015); Oil Gas Storage and Transportation, (2017); Oil Gas Storage and Transportation, (2015); Achim, Daniela, Prediction of water pipe asset life using neural networks, Journal of Infrastructure Systems, 13, 1, pp. 26-30, (2007); da Cunha Bisaggio, Helio, Pipeline remaining life estimation based on concepts of structural reliability and Bayesian inference, Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE, 6B, (2014)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 Chinese Automation Congress, CAC 2019","2019-11-22 through 2019-11-24","Hangzhou","157710","","9781728140940","","","English","Proc. - Chin.

These frameworks specialize in specific analytics variants. In addition to traditional batch-oriented computations (e.g. MapReduce, Apache Hive [14] and Apache Pig [18]), the Apache Hadoop ecosystem now contains streaming analytics frameworks (e.g. Apache Apex [8]), MPP SQL engines (e.g. Apache Trafodion [20], Apache Impala [15], and Apache HAWQ [12]), OLAP cubing frameworks (e.g. Apache Kylin [17]), frameworks suitable for iterative machine learning (e.g. Apache Spark [19] and Apache Flink [10]), and graph processing (e.g. GraphX). With emergence of Hadoop Distributed File System and its various implementations as preferred method of constructing a data lake, end-to-end data pipelines are increasingly being built on the Hadoop-based data lake platform. While benchmarks have been developed for individual tasks, such as Sort (TPCx-HS [5]), and Analytical SQL queries (TPC-xBB [6]), there is a need for a standard benchmark that exercises various phases of an endto- end data pipeline in a data lake. In this paper, we propose a benchmark called AdBench, which combines Ad-Serving, Streaming Analytics on Ad-serving logs, streaming ingestion and updates of various data entities, batch-oriented analytics (e.g. for Billing), Ad-Hoc analytical queries, and Machine learning for Ad targeting. While this benchmark is specific to modern Web or Mobile advertising companies and exchanges, the workload characteristics are found in many verticals, such as Internet of Things (IoT), financial services, retail, and healthcare. We also propose a set of metrics to be measured for each phase of the pipeline, and various scale factors of the benchmark. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Computer software; File organization; Internet of things; Iterative methods; Lakes; Learning systems; Outsourcing; Pipelines; Scheduling; Wool; Yarn; Analytical queries; Distributed programming; Financial service; Hadoop distributed file systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Mobile advertising; Resource management and scheduling; Workload characteristics; Big data","","","","","","","Baru, Chaitanya, Discussion of bigbench: A proposed industry standard performance benchmark for big data, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 8904, pp. 44-63, (2015); Baru, Chaitanya, Benchmarking Big Data Systems and the BigData Top100 List, Big Data, 1, 1, pp. 60-64, (2013); Cask Data Application Platform Cdap, (2016); undefined, (2016); Tpc Express Benchmark Hs Standard Specification, (2016); undefined, (2016); Tpc Website, (2016); Apache Apex, (2016); Apache Cassandra, (2016); Apache Flink, (2016)","M.

The machine learning methods used in bioinformatics are iterative and parallel. These methods can be scaled to handle big data using the distributed and parallel computing technologies. Usually big data tools perform computation in batch mode and are not optimized for iterative processing and high data dependency among operations. In the recent years, parallel, incremental, and multi-view machine learning algorithms have been proposed. Similarly, graph-based architectures and in-memory big data tools have been developed to minimize I/O cost and optimize iterative processing. However, standard big data architectures are still lacking. Also appropriate tools are not available for many important bioinformatics problems, such as fast construction of co-expression and regulatory networks and salient module identification, detection of complexes over growing protein-protein interaction data, fast analysis of massive DNA, RNA, and protein sequence data, and fast querying on incremental and heterogeneous disease networks.

This paper presents an emotion-based social computing platform namely ESC for streaming big-data. The main aim of ESC is to provide sentiment analysis as the foundation of social computing and enable both real-Time computation on streaming big-data and batch computation on off-line big-data with high performance and low risk. Different from conventional data processing technologies, ESC is designed as a scalable and QoS-optimized adaptive platform for developers to only focus on business models instead of being distracted by details of the computing infrastructure. In addition, continuous streaming computing is emphasized in ESC to keep tracking on long term dynamic evolution in social media, which can provide a valuable proxy for in-depth social analytics. The architecture of ESC is implemented by distributed storage, sentiment analysis, data parallelism and routing, real-Time streaming computation, batch computation and distributed machine learning. And the evaluation results from real-Time and batch computations testify the high performance and scalability of ESC. Moreover, a few applications based on it further demonstrates its usability in enacting on different streaming big-data and variety of social computations. © 2016 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Learning systems; Media streaming; Risk assessment; Application scenario; Computing infrastructures; Data processing technologies; Distributed machine learning; High-performance and scalabilities; Real time streaming; Real-time computations; User-generated content; Big data","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71501005, 71531001)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71501005 and 71531001)","Filgueira, Rosa, Dispel4py: A python framework for data-intensive scientific computing, Proceedings of DISCS 2014: The 2014 International Workshop on Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Systems - Held in Conjuction with SC 2014: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, pp. 9-16, (2014); Ranjan, Rajiv, Streaming Big Data Processing in Datacenter Clouds, IEEE Cloud Computing, 1, 1, pp. 78-83, (2014); Osman, Amr, Towards real-time analytics in the cloud, Proceedings - 2013 IEEE 9th World Congress on Services, SERVICES 2013, pp. 428-435, (2013); De Roure, David, Software design for empowering scientists, IEEE Software, 26, 1, pp. 88-95, (2009); Tdwi Best Practices Report, (2011); Shvachko, Konstantin, The Hadoop distributed file system, 2010 IEEE 26th Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies, MSST2010, (2010); IBM Technical Library, (2013); Hotcloud; Learning Apache Kafka, (2015); Definitive Guide to Mongodb the Nosql Database for Cloud and Desktop Computing, (2010)","J.

Scalable Big Data Architecture covers real-world, concrete industry use cases that leverage complex distributed applications , which involve web applications, RESTful API, and high throughput of large amount of data stored in highly scalable No-SQL data stores such as Couchbase and Elasticsearch. This book demonstrates how data processing can be done at scale from the usage of NoSQL datastores to the combination of Big Data distribution. When the data processing is too complex and involves different processing topology like long running jobs, stream processing, multiple data sources correlation, and machine learning, it's often necessary to delegate the load to Hadoop or Spark and use the No-SQLto serve processed data in real time. This book shows you how to choose a relevant combination of big data technologies available within the Hadoop ecosystem. It focuses on processing long jobs, architecture, stream data patterns, log analysis, and real time analytics. Every pattern is illustrated with practical examples, which use the different open sourceprojects such as Logstash, Spark, Kafka, and so on. Traditional data infrastructures are built for digesting and rendering data synthesis and analytics from large amount of data. This book helps you to understand why you should consider using machine learning algorithms early on in the project, before being overwhelmed by constraints imposed by dealing with the high throughput of Big data. Scalable Big Data Architecture is for developers, data architects, and data scientists looking for a better understanding of how to choose the most relevant pattern for a Big Data project and which tools tointegrate into that pattern. © 2016 by Bahaaldine Azarmi.

This technique is inefficient due to the short lifetime of phishing Web sites, making recent approaches relying on real-time or proactive phishing URL detection techniques more appropriate. In this paper, we introduce PhishStorm, an automated phishing detection system that can analyze in real time any URL in order to identify potential phishing sites. PhishStorm can interface with any email server or HTTP proxy. We argue that phishing URLs usually have few relationships between the part of the URL that must be registered (low-level domain) and the remaining part of the URL (upper-level domain, path, query). We show in this paper that experimental evidence supports this observation and can be used to detect phishing sites. For this purpose, we define the new concept of intra-URL relatedness and evaluate it using features extracted from words that compose a URL based on query data from Google and Yahoo search engines. These features are then used in machine-learning-based classification to detect phishing URLs from a real dataset. Our technique is assessed on 96 018 phishing and legitimate URLs that result in a correct classification rate of 94.91% with only 1.44% false positives. An extension for a URL phishingness rating system exhibiting high confidence rate (> 99%) is proposed. We discuss in this paper efficient implementation patterns that allow real-time analytics using Big Data architectures such as STORM and advanced data structures based on the Bloom filter. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Big Data; Machine Learning; Mining and Statistical Methods; Phishing Detection; Search Engine Query Data; Security Management; STORM; URL Rating; Word Relatedness","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Data structures; Filtration; HTTP; Internet; Learning systems; Storms; Classification rates; Efficient implementation; Experimental evidence; Phishing detections; Prevention techniques; Query datum; Security management; Word Relatedness; Search engines","","","","","","","Gartner Survey Shows Phishing Attacks Escalated in 2007 More than 3 Billion Lost to these Attacks, (2007); 2009 Identity Fraud Survey Report Consumer Version, (2010); Proc Ecrime, (2011); Global Phishing Survey Trends and Domain Name Use in 2h2009, (2010); Ssac Advisory on Fast Flux Hosting and Dns, (2008); Phishing Activity Trends Report, (2006); Computational Linguistics, (1990); Cilibrasi, Rudi L., The Google similarity distance, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 19, 3, pp. 370-383, (2007); Proceedings of Konvens 2008, (2008); Miller, George A., WordNet: A Lexical Database for English, Communications of the ACM, 38, 11, pp. 39-41, (1995)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","19324537","","","","English","IEEE Trans.
