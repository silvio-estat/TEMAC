The proposed architecture is evaluated through test execution and performance benchmarking in real-world data centers across three regions in Kazakhstan. The model integrates distributed resource management components, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based scheduling mechanism, and Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) to enable dynamic workload distribution and rapid failure recovery. The results demonstrate that the hybrid system consistently outperforms standalone Spark and Hadoop architectures under variable workloads, illustrating enhancements in execution time, task recovery, and resource utilization. Quantitative performance metrics allow for a structured comparison of architectures and help optimize deployments for diverse scenarios. The proposed hybrid architecture shows significant improvements, reducing average execution time by up to 38% and increasing resource efficiency by 25% compared to standalone Spark and Hadoop systems. © 2025, Ital Publication.

The integration and harmonization of geospatial data from heterogeneous sources represents a significant challenge in the context of the implementation of the INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe) Directive. The need for stan-dardization of geospatial data, both on a global scale and in the context of the INSPIRE Directive, is primarily driven by the need for interoperability, integration and efficient analysis of spatial information from different systems, formats and semantic structures. In this paper we propose a comprehensive and extensible architecture for the automatic transformation and harmonization of heterogeneous spatial data into INSPIRE-compliant formats, that ensures interoperability within the European infrastructure.

This systematic mapping study analyzes many BDA architectures proposed in the literature, revealing a fragmented landscape in which the proposed architectures are largely conceptual with limited industrial validation. Our analysis identifies dominant technological patterns, such as Apache Kafka for ingestion, Spark for processing, and Hadoop and Hive for storage, with the majority of implementations favoring open-source solutions. Despite their theoretical importance, real-time analytics capabilities remain underutilized in practice. This study synthesizes a unified conceptual reference architecture with eight fundamental layers to provide a framework for comparative analysis. We document an imbalance in layer development: storage and processing receive comprehensive attention while querying, infrastructure management, and monitoring layers remain underdeveloped. Implementation approaches show distinct patterns in deployment strategies and data handling, with structured and semi-structured data well supported, whereas unstructured data integration presents ongoing challenges. Future research should focus on developing standardized modular frameworks, benchmarking methodologies, and integrating modern data lakehouse architectures to bridge the gap between theoretical proposals and production-ready systems. © 2013 IEEE.","Big data analytics (BDA); cyber-physical systems (CPS); data lake; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Industry 4.0; smart manufacturing","Advanced Analytics; Architecture; Benchmarking; Big data; Computer architecture; Data assimilation; Data integration; Decision making; Digital storage; Information management; Lakes; Smart manufacturing; 'current; Big data analytic; Cybe-physical system; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data analytics; Data lake; Industrial internet of thing; Systematic evaluation; Industry 4.0","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (00x0ma614)","This work was supported by the Coordena\u00E7\u00E3o de Aperfei\u00E7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00EDvel Superior (CAPES) (Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifier: 00x0ma614) for the Article Processing Charge.","Nain, Garima, Towards edge computing in intelligent manufacturing: Past, present and future, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 62, pp. 588-611, (2022); Ikegwu, Anayo Chukwu, Big data analytics for data-driven industry: a review of data sources, tools, challenges, solutions, and research directions, Cluster Computing, 25, 5, pp. 3343-3387, (2022); Saeed, Nimra, Incorporating big data and IoT in intelligent ecosystems: state-of-the-arts, challenges and opportunities, and future directions, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 83, 7, pp. 20699-20741, (2024); Proc Int Conf NDE, (2023); Belhadi, Amine, Understanding Big Data Analytics for Manufacturing Processes: Insights from Literature Review and Multiple Case Studies, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 137, (2019); Ismail, Ahmed, Manufacturing process data analysis pipelines: a requirements analysis and survey, Journal of Big Data, 6, 1, (2019); Sahal, Radhya, Big data and stream processing platforms for Industry 4.0 requirements mapping for a predictive maintenance use case, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 54, pp. 138-151, (2020); Sawadogo, Pegdwendé, On data lake architectures and metadata management, Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 56, 1, pp. 97-120, (2021); J Manuf Syst, (2022); Petersen, Kai, Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering: An update, Information and Software Technology, 64, pp. 1-18, (2015)","A.R.

It is designed for modern data-parallel execution (SIMD or GPU), and evolves the features of previous data formats such as Parquet, which are the foundation of data lakes, and which increasingly are used in AI pipelines. It does so by avoiding generic compression methods (e.g. Snappy) in favor of lightweight encodings, that are fully data-parallel. To enhance compression ratio, it cascades encodings using a flexible expression encoding mechanism. This mechanism also enables multi-column compression (MCC), enhancing compression by exploiting correlations between columns, a long-time weakness of columnar storage. We contribute a 2-phase algorithm to nd encodings expressions during compression. FastLanes also innovates in its API, providing flexible support for partial decompression, facilitating engines to execute queries on compressed data. FastLanes is designed for ne-grained access, at the level of small batches rather than rowgroups; in order to limit the decompression memory footprint to t CPU and GPU caches. We contribute an open-source implementation of FastLanes in portable (auto-vectorizing) C++. Our evaluation on a corpus of real-world data shows that FastLanes improves compression ratio over Parquet, while strongly accelerating decompression, making it a win-win over the state-of-the-art. © 2025, VLDB Endowment.

In these fields, data are typically diverse in format and subject. Consequently, challenges in storing, tracking, and responsibly sharing valuable data have become increasingly evident over the past decades. To address the complexities, some approaches have leveraged standard strategies, such as using non-relational databases and data warehouses. However, these approaches often fall short in providing the flexibility and scalability required for complex projects. While the data lake paradigm has emerged to offer flexibility and handle large volumes of diverse data, it lacks robust data governance and organization. The data lakehouse is a new paradigm that combines the flexibility of a data lake with the governance of a data warehouse, offering a promising solution for managing heterogeneous data in bioinformatics. However, the lakehouse model remains unexplored in bioinformatics, with limited discussion in the current literature. In this study, we review strategies and tools for developing a data lakehouse infrastructure tailored to bioinformatics research. We summarize key concepts and assess available open-source and commercial solutions for managing data in bioinformatics.

These architectures are based on integrating heterogeneous data from different sources while ensuring that it is stored centrally. They also focus on data quality to guarantee the accuracy of analyses, and on reliable governance to ensure data compliance, security and traceability. These aspects are essential to enable optimal use of data for advanced analysis and informed decision-making in healthcare. Our objective in this article is to propose an architecture that ensures the 3 points: integration, storage and governance. The article proposes the DLMF architecture to ensure that these 3 points are adapted to good data analysis. This architecture uses the concept of a data lake for the consolidation and storage of data sources, a data mesh and a data fabric to ensure everything to do with data integration, quality and governance. The article also proposes a set of open-source technologies for its implementation. Finally, recommendations and future directions are suggested for a well-designed BI architecture capable of ensuring good data management, from data integration to analysis. © Little Lion Scientific.","Data Fabric; Data Lake; Data Mesh; Decision Support Architecture; Healthcare","","","","","","","","Managing and Using Information Systems A Strategic Approach, (2025); Spencer, Stephen Andrew, A health systems approach to critical care delivery in low-resource settings: a narrative review, Intensive Care Medicine, 49, 7, pp. 772-784, (2023); Dixon, Brian Edward, Measuring the value of health information exchange, Health Information Exchange: Navigating and Managing a Network of Health Information Systems, pp. 379-398, (2022); Hosen, Mohammed Shahadat, Data-Driven Decision Making: Advanced Database Systems for Business Intelligence, Nanotechnology Perceptions, 20, S3, pp. 687-704, (2024); Mahiddin, Nor Aida, An Interrelated Decision-Making Model for an Intelligent Decision Support System in Healthcare, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 31660-31676, (2022); López-Martínez, Fernando Enrique, A case study for a big data and machine learning platform to improve medical decision support in population health management, Algorithms, 13, 4, (2020); Halawa, Farouq, Advancing evidence-based healthcare facility design: a systematic literature review, Health Care Management Science, 23, 3, pp. 453-480, (2020); Foundations of Data Quality Management, (2012); Mrabet, Hichem, A survey of IoT security based on a layered architecture of sensing and data analysis, Sensors (Switzerland), 20, 13, pp. 1-20, (2020); Ranjan, Jayanthi, Big Data Analytics in Building the Competitive Intelligence of Organizations, International Journal of Information Management, 56, (2021)","","","Little Lion Scientific","","","","","","19928645","","","","English","J.

This paper proposes an end-to-end scalable architecture for the continuous early identification of new Tor sites and the daily analysis of their content. The solution is built using an Open Source Big Data stack for data serving with Kubernetes, Kafka, Kubeflow, and MinIO, continuously discovering onion addresses in different sources (threat intelligence, code repositories, web-Tor gateways, and Tor repositories), downloading the HTML from Tor and deduplicating the content using MinHash LSH, and categorizing with the BERTopic modeling (SBERT embedding, UMAP dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN document clustering and c-TF-IDF topic keywords). In 93 days, the system identified 80,049 onion services and characterized 90% of them, addressing the challenge of Tor volatility. A disproportionate amount of repeated content is found, with only 6.1% unique sites. From the HTML files of the dark sites, 31 different low-topics are extracted, manually labeled, and grouped into 11 high-level topics. The five most popular included sexual and violent content, repositories and search engines, carding, cryptocurrencies, and marketplaces. During the experiments, we identified 14 sites with 13,946 clones that shared a suspiciously similar mirroring rate per day, suggesting an extensive common phishing network. Among the related works, this study is the most representative characterization of onion services based on topics to date. © 2024 The Author(s)","BERT; Big Data; Dark web; Threat intelligence; Tor network analysis; Web content categorization","C (programming language); HTML; Network architecture; Open systems; Search engines; BERT; Dark web; Data architectures; End to end; Threat intelligence; Tor network analyse; Tor networks; Web content; Web content categorization; Web-sites; Big data","","","","","Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad, INCIBE; (FPU18/00304, EST22/00738)","This study was partially funded by (a) the Spanish Government with the FPU18/00304 contract and EST22/00738 mobility grant, and by (b) the strategic project “Development of Professionals and Researchers in Cybersecurity, Cyberdefense and Data Science (CDL-TALENTUM)” from the Spanish National Institute of Cybersecurity (INCIBE) and by the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan, Next Generation EU.

A key customer requirement for BigQuery centers around the unification of data lake and enterprise data warehousing workloads. This approach combines: (1) the need for core data management primitives, e.g., security, governance, common runtime metadata, performance acceleration, ACID transactions, provided by an enterprise data warehouses coupled with (2) harnessing the flexibility of the open source format and analytics ecosystem along with new workload types such as AI/ML over unstructured data on object storage. In addition, there is a strong requirement to support BigQuery as a multi-cloud offering given cloud customers are opting for a multi-cloud footprint by default. This paper describes BigLake, an evolution of BigQuery toward a multi-cloud lakehouse to address these customer requirements in novel ways. We describe three main innovations in this space. We first present BigLake tables, making open-source table formats (e.g., Apache Parquet, Iceberg) first class citizens, providing fine-grained governance enforcement and performance acceleration over these formats to BigQuery and other open-source analytics engines. Next, we cover the design and implementation of BigLake Object tables that allow BigQuery to integrate AI/ML for inferencing and processing over unstructured data. Finally, we present Omni, a platform for deploying BigQuery on non-GCP clouds, focusing on the infrastructure and operational innovations we made to provide an enterprise lakehouse product regardless of the cloud provider hosting the data. © 2024 Owner/Author.","data lake; data warehousing; multi-cloud analytics; unstructured data","Cloud analytics; Data handling; Digital storage; Information management; Lakes; Sales; Sea ice; Customer need; Customer requirements; Data lake; Google+; Multi-cloud analytic; Multi-clouds; Open-source; Performance acceleration; Spectra's; Unstructured data; Data warehouses","","","","","","","Apache Hudi, (2023); Apache Iceberg the Open Table Format for Analytic Datasets, (2023); Apache Parquet, (2023); Container Optimized Os, (2023); Google Cloud Dataproc, (2023); Google Infrastructure Security, (2023); Spark Bigquery Connector, (2023); Slsa Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts, (2023); Tensorflow Large Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, (2015); Armbrust, Michael, Delta Lake: High-Performance ACID Table Storage over Cloud Object Stores, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 13, 12, pp. 3411-3424, (2020)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGMOD","2024 International Conference on Management of Data, SIGMOD 2024","2024-06-09 through 2024-06-15","Santiago","200185","07308078","0897910400; 9781450330121; 0897913175; 0897914252; 9781581139020; 9781450343190; 9781450341929; 158113908X; 0897910737; 9781450367974","","","English","Proc.

In this paper, the focus is shifted back to the Smart Shop Floor and how to efficiently derive information with the big data tasks that follow as simple as possible. A condensed literature review of the existing architectures and frameworks for Smart Manufacturing is combined with the experience of practitioners to assess the requirements for a Smart Shop Floor Information System Architecture. On this basis, an architecture is proposed that consists of eight modular building blocks. After a detailed description of the roles and functionalities of these building blocks, a reference implementation using readily available, open-source tools and technologies is laid out. This reference implementation intends to strike the right balance between generality and specificity. It provides the reader with a tangible starting point for implementing and adapting the proposed architecture to their own needs. © 2024 IEEE.","Data Architecture; IIoT; Industry 4.0; Information System Architecture; Smart Manufacturing","Architecture-based; Building blockes; Data architectures; IIoT; Information system architecture; Namespaces; Reference implementation; Shopfloors; Simple++; Smart manufacturing","","","","","National Foundation for Science and Technology Development, NAFOSTED; Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft, CDG","The financial support by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Labour and Economy, the National Foundation for Research, Technology, and Development and the Christian Doppler Research Association is gratefully acknowledged.","A 4 0 Automated Warehouse Storage and Picking System for Order Fulfillment, (2021); Tubis, Agnieszka Anna, Intelligent Warehouse in Industry 4.0—Systematic Literature Review, Sensors, 23, 8, (2023); Salcher, Felix, Automated Process Capability Analysis for Product Quality Improvements, Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Engineering, Technology, and Innovation: Shaping the Future, ICE 2023, (2023); Raj, Alok, Barriers to the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies in the manufacturing sector: An inter-country comparative perspective, International Journal of Production Economics, 224, (2020); Industry 4 0 Digitalisation for Productivity and Growth, (2015); Smart Manufacturing Technologies for Industry 4 0 Integration Benefits and Operational Activities Ser Advances in Intelligent Decision Making Systems Engineering and Project Management, (2022); J Ubiquitous Syst Pervasive Networks, (2021); Pech, Martin, Predictive maintenance and intelligent sensors in smart factory: Review, Sensors, 21, 4, pp. 1-39, (2021); Zenisek, Jan, Investigating the Potential of Smart Manufacturing Technologies, Procedia Computer Science, 180, pp. 507-516, (2021); Ihekoronye, Vivian Ukamaka, Benefits, Challenges and Practical Concerns of IoT for Smart Manufacturing, International Conference on ICT Convergence, 2021-October, pp. 827-830, (2021)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","30th ICE IEEE/ITMC Conference on Engineering, Technology, and Innovation, ICE/ITMC 2024","2024-06-24 through 2024-06-28","Funchal","205312","","9798350362435","","","English","Proc.

The data warehouses are implemented to integrate structured datasets. A data lake provides storing capabilities for unstructured data. Nowadays, the two concepts are integrated in data lakehouse platforms that provide facilities for structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. The open-source framework for managing and processing huge amounts of data Hadoop is observed. More precisely, the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) organization is discussed.

HPCC (High-Performance Computing Clusters) system is an open-source data lake platform built for high-speed large-volume data engineering. Enterprise Control Language (ECL) is a declarative language specifically designed for huge data projects on the HPCC system platform. Large amounts of data are processed on a regular basis using HPCC systems, In the proposed work an approach to understand and interpret the data flow within an ECL program is investigated. The current system renders an XML graph, which shows the operations at dataset level which can be viewed in the ECL Watch, an interactive web application developed by HPCC systems. As the data changes of individual fields within dataset are not represented, the proposed work field level data and dependencies within datasets are tracked and their changes and operations are visualized as a directed acyclic graph for a generic ECL program to understand its data workflow. The core of this project relies on parsing the ECL IR (Intermediate Representation) emitted by the ECL compiler. The IR generated is transformed into graphical format. The system was tested against sample ECL programs available in ECL watch and other programs available in the platform regression tests and it provided a simple easy to comprehend data flow visualization. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Big data; Distributed systems; Graph Representation; HPCC systems; Parser","Big data; Data flow analysis; Data flow graphs; Data transfer; Data visualization; Open systems; Clusters system; Dataflow; Distributed systems; Enterprise controls; Field level; Graph representation; High-performance computing cluster system; High-performance computing clusters; Parse; Work-flows; Watches","","","","","","","Manikandan, Shankar Ganesh, Big data analysis using apache hadoop, 2014 International Conference on IT Convergence and Security, ICITCS 2014, (2014); Why Hpcc Systems is A Superior Alternative to Hadoop; Hpcc Systems End to End Data Lake Management Solution; 2011 IEEE International Conference on Big Data Big Data, (2011); undefined; undefined; Bhadauria, Anurag Singh, Design and Implementation of HSQL: A SQL-like language for Data Analysis in Distributed Systems, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 12, 11, pp. 796-803, (2021); undefined; Compiler Tutorial; undefined","J.

CSPs offer individual services for storage, processing, and analytics, and due to the repetitive nature of big data processing, these workflows are available as managed or open-source orchestration services. Stream and batch processing services are specialized for handling real-time unbounded stream data and large volumes of data that need to be processed batch-wise and stored in data lakes and warehouses. We analyze the services and data management patterns and pipelines from leading CSPs such as Amazon, Google, and Azure. The comparative study aims to provide various stakeholders of big data from data analysts to data scientists and novice researchers knowledge of the various options available and to aid in designing a cost-effective and efficient solution for any analytics application.

It is a new virus. The huge quantity of COVID data that has been beneficial to the health sector in tracking and minimizing the impacts of virus has to be analyzed using the proper tools and procedures. There is a need for researchers and developers to track the transmission of the virus and obtain a thorough grasp of the illness. As a result of COVID-19's enormous scale and global reach, only big data and NOSQL databases are adequate for the task at hand. When working with the COVID databases, researchers ran upon a slew of application programmers who used a variety of APIs and queries to access the hybrid data models used by those programmers. Hadoop, HDFS/Map Reduce, and NOSQL databases have been studied by previous academics. The spark tool and the Scala language are proposed in this study as a framework for doing complicated queries on the COVID Data Set. In the suggested framework, there are three stages of development. In the first step, we collect data, in the second we query it, and in the third, we analyse it. Uses Big Data processing tools such as Apache Spark with an open-source programming language like Scala that is easy for a programmer to utilise. Scala is a parallel-processing-friendly programming language. Flexibility and processing time are two of the benefits of the suggested framework. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Maritime data is growing at an unprecedented rate, with terabytes of marine data being collected every month and petabytes of data already being made public. Heterogeneous marine data collected through various devices can be used in various fields such as environmental protection, defect prediction, transportation route optimization, and energy efficiency. However, it is difficult to manage vessel related data due to high heterogeneity of such marine big data. Additionally, due to the high heterogeneity of these data sources and some of the challenges associated with big data, such applications are still underdeveloped and fragmented. In this paper, we propose the Vessel Data Lakehouse architecture consisting of the Vessel Data Lake layer that can handle marine big data, the Vessel Data Warehouse layer that supports marine big data processing and AI, and the Vessel Application Services layer that supports marine application services. Our proposed a Vessel Data Lakehouse that can efficiently manage heterogeneous vessel related data. It can be integrated and managed at low cost by structuring various types of heterogeneous data using an open source-based big data framework. In addition, various types of vessel big data stored in the Data Lakehouse can be directly utilized in various types of vessel analysis services.

In many cases, this can be as time-consuming as the analysis itself. It requires downloading multiple public databases with various data structures, and in general, spending days preparing the data before answering any biological questions. Here, we introduce Sherlock, an open-source, cloud-based big data platform (https://earlham-sherlock.github.io/) to solve this problem. Sherlock provides a gap-filling way for computational biologists to store, convert, query, share and generate biology data while ultimately streamlining bioinformatics data management. The Sherlock platform offers a simple interface to leverage big data technologies, such as Docker and PrestoDB. Sherlock is designed to enable users to analyze, process, query and extract information from extremely complex and large data sets. Furthermore, Sherlock can handle different structured data (interaction, localization, or genomic sequence) from several sources and convert them to a common optimized storage format, for example, the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC). This format facilitates Sherlock’s ability to quickly and efficiently execute distributed analytical queries on extremely large data files and share datasets between teams. The Sherlock platform is freely available on GitHub, and contains specific loader scripts for structured data sources of genomics, interaction and expression databases. With these loader scripts, users can easily and quickly create and work with specific file formats, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or ORC. For computational biology and large-scale bioinformatics projects, Sherlock provides an open-source platform empowering data management, analytics, integration and collaboration through modern big data technologies. ©: © 2023 Bohar B et al.","big data; Computational biology; data integration; Data lake; data management; Network biology; Software; Systems biology","article; big data; bioinformatics; biologist; cloud computing; data base; data integration; drug development; genomics; human; information processing; lake; nonhuman; software; systems biology","","","","","(BB/CSP17270/1, BB/J004529/1, BB/P016774/1); (BBS/E/F/000PR10355); (BB/R012490/1); (BB/S50743X/1); (BB/M011216/1); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (BBS/E/F/000PR10353)","MM is supported by a Biotechnological and Biosciences Research Council (BBSRC) funded Norwich Research Park Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (grant number BB/S50743X/1), as an NPIF Award.

Modern investors use variety of tools to take informed investment decisions. In the current era of digital world, financial service industry has generated huge volume and immense verities of data with extreme speed. Due to the rapid growth in data collection and the heterogeneous nature and complexity of the data, there is a need for Big Data analytical solution that would be able to deal with the stock market data. Large volumes of unstructured, heterogeneous raw data can be stored in a massively scalable manner using data lakes, which are the ideal solution to the big data storage conundrum. The ability of a data lake to preserve data in its original format while processing it at runtime using a schema on-read technique is its key feature. The challenge faced in the data lake is performing analytics which is a significant tool to calculate and analyze the stock market. The proposed architecture of Azure Databricks DeltaLake (ADDL) with Azure DataLake Storage Generation 2 (ADLSG2) is used for analytical processes like Fibonacci retracement for better stock analysis, which aid in forecasting the market price for better investment. As a result, the research focus is to produce a storage having read as well as write capabilities by taking into consideration the Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) operation on the datasource. In this experimental databricks implementation, runtime is performed using open source of Apache Spark API and a highly improved execution engine, which results in a significant performance improvement when comparing to the standard source of Apache Spark available on the ADLS platform. Additionally, the Fibonacci retracement level calculation is achieved with the analytics and forecasting of test close price with various ML and DL techniques such as KNN, LSTM are compared with original price of the test data for better prediction of forecast close price. © 2023 IEEE.","ADLSG2; Apache spark; Big data analytics; Databricks Delta Lake; ELT; Fibonacci retracement; LSTM; stock market","Advanced Analytics; Commerce; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Lakes; Long short-term memory; Apache spark; Azure datalake storage generation 2; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Databrick delta lake; Extract-load-transform; Fibonacci retracement; Load transform; LSTM; Runtimes; Big data","","","","","","","Chong, Dazhi, Big data analytics: a literature review, Journal of Management Analytics, 2, 3, pp. 175-201, (2015); Russian Technological Journal, (2021); Cappa, Francesco, Big Data for Creating and Capturing Value in the Digitalized Environment: Unpacking the Effects of Volume, Variety, and Veracity on Firm Performance*, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 38, 1, pp. 49-67, (2021); Yang, Chaowei Phil, Big Data and cloud computing: innovation opportunities and challenges, International Journal of Digital Earth, 10, 1, pp. 13-53, (2017); Itm Web Conf, (2018); Big Data Fast Data and Data Lake Concepts, (2016); Ilin, Dmitry Yu, Performance Analysis of Software with a Variant NoSQL Data Schemes, Proceedings of 2020 13th International Conference Management of Large-Scale System Development, MLSD 2020, (2020); Sawadogo, Pegdwendé, Metadata Systems for Data Lakes: Models and Features, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1064, pp. 440-451, (2019); Armbrust, Michael, Delta Lake: High-Performance ACID Table Storage over Cloud Object Stores, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 13, 12, pp. 3411-3424, (2020); Data Lake Architecture Designing the Data Lake and Avoiding the Garbage Dump, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 International Conference on Self Sustainable Artificial Intelligence Systems, ICSSAS 2023","2023-10-18 through 2023-10-20","Erode","195071","","9798350300857","","","English","Int.

One common scenario involves transferring data from distributed devices in the field to central servers or cloud environments. However, little research has been done on the possibilities for forensic investigation of supporting infrastructure such as Apache Kafka, which plays a crucial role in modern big data architectures. In this paper, we present our work on the forensic investigation of Apache Kafka. We use methodologies of reverse engineering to infer the data formats that Apache Kafka uses server-side. The results help us to implement a new module that is able to read Apache Kafka log files. An investigator can load the module in the open-source forensic platform “Autopsy”. We highlight possibilities and limitations regarding encryption and data retention in Apache Kafka and suggest to store data decentralized when it comes to sensitive data. As a result of these measures, applications become more resilient to attacks and are able to provide increased security, ethical standards, and freedom for the application users. This can be a unique selling point in future data driven applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Cryptography; Reverse engineering; Central servers; Cloud environments; Data architectures; Data forensics; Distributed devices; Forensic investigation; Growing demand; Information exchanges; Logfile; Server sides; Sensitive data","","","","","","","Fu, Guo, A Fair Comparison of Message Queuing Systems, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 421-432, (2021); Apache Kafka Von Den Grundlagen Bis Zum Produktivein Satz, (2021); Wagner, James, Database forensic analysis through internal structure carving, Digital Investigation, 14, S1, pp. S106-S115, (2015); Pereira, Murilo Tito, Forensic analysis of the Firefox 3 Internet history and recovery of deleted SQLite records, Digital Investigation, 5, 3-4, pp. 93-103, (2009); Computer Science Engineering an International Journal Cseij, (2012); Beyers, Hector, Assembling metadata for database forensics, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 361, pp. 89-99, (2011); Chivers, Howard, Forensic data recovery from the Windows Search Database, Digital Investigation, 7, 3-4, pp. 114-126, (2011); Yoon, Jongseong, Forensic investigation framework for the document store NoSQL DBMS: MongoDB as a case study, Digital Investigation, 17, pp. 53-65, (2016); Sleuth Kit Autopsy, (2025); Lin, Xiaodong, Introductory Computer Forensics: A Hands-on Practical Approach, Introductory Computer Forensics: A Hands-on Practical Approach, pp. 1-577, (2018)","T.

Air pollutant data and climatic variables from Quito, Ecuador, measured by the Atmospheric Monitoring Network of the city, were used. After cleaning, Quito Air Pollution Index was calculated. The proposed architecture is open-source and is made up of a cluster with a master node and two worker-nodes. This cluster consists of a unified analysis computational system in Spark, managed by Yarn, and linked to a graphical interface provided by Zeppelin. It processes data and displays it visually through geographic maps. To verify that this architecture improves response times, a comparison was made between using the system and not using it. The geographic interpolation results were 4.52 s with a Geographical Information System, while the proposed system showed an execution time of 2.0 s, indicating a reduction of 56%. This architecture showed an improvement in the traditional interpolation and map visualization processes, and generated a new open-source alternative with resources and time optimization. In addition, this research work could contribute to the making of strategic decisions through a new way of analyzing environmental problems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","air pollution; Big Data architecture; Parallel geo-computation","Air pollution; Interpolation; Network architecture; Parallel architectures; Visualization; Air pollutants; Big data architecture; Data architectures; Ecuador; Geocomputation; Geographic data; Massive data; Open-source; Parallel geo-computation; Spatial visualization; Data visualization","","","","","","We want to thank Francisco Gallegos and Brigitte Balón for their valuable ideas in the graphical interface integration into architecture.

Over the past decade, Big Data architectures evolved into specialized layers for handling real-time storage and stream processing. Open-source streaming architectures efficiently decouple fast storage and processing engines by implementing stream reads through a pull-based interface exposed by storage. However, how much data the stream source operators have to pull from storage continuously and how often to issue pull-based requests are configurations left to the application and can result in increased system resources and overall reduced application performance. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a unified streaming architecture that integrates co-located fast storage and streaming engines through push-based source integrations, making the data available for processing as soon as storage has them. We empirically evaluate pull-based versus push-based design alternatives of the streaming source reader and discuss the advantages of both approaches. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.","Locality; Pull-based; Push-based; Real-time storage; Streaming","Computer architecture; Computer hardware description languages; Data handling; Engines; Open systems; Data architectures; Locality; Pull-based; Push-based; Real- time; Real-time data; Real-time storage; Storage engines; Streaming; Streaming architecture; Digital storage","","","","","(NAVER.2022); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA2386-22-1-4026); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Université du Luxembourg; Tập đoàn Vingroup - Công ty CP; Trường Đại học Bách Khoa Hà Nội, HUST, (T2022-PC-044); Trường Đại học Bách Khoa Hà Nội, HUST; Naver Corporation; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF, (AISG2-100E-2022-102); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (MOE2019-T2-1-084, REQ0149132); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (20H0417, 23H03377); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS; Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR, (C22/IS/17395419); Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR; Waseda University; Narodowym Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2020/37/B/ST6/03463); Narodowym Centrum Nauki, NCN; Horizon 2020, (952215); Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements.

The traditional approach adopted by these systems, are based on common architectures represented in most of the time by the data warehouses. These works with relational database systems supporting data of structured type as well. However, the decision-making process is often not limited to structured data. Indeed, with the emergence of Big Data, the value of data can also be extracted from massive data sources containing data of diverse types, structured, semi-structured and unstructured. As a result, NoSQL systems have been integrated into the architecture of decision support system, in parallel with data warehouses, in order to overcome their limitations regarding Big Data characteristics. In this sense, this article presents a synthetic literature review on the work done in recent years, treating the hybridization of traditional systems with NoSQL databases, including relational databases and traditional data warehouses. We aim by this work to scheme the limits of the existing approaches and to determine the most fitting characteristics for the design of a hybrid architecture suitable for the migration of companies to Big Data architectures. Furthermore, we discussed the utility of implementing a data lake in decision support system architecture: On one hand as a way to solve the problems related to information silos that current architectures encounter and on the other hand, as an upgrading technique for traditional decision support system architecture. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data; Data warehouse; Decision support system; Hybrid systems; NoSQL systems; Relational databases","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer architecture; Data warehouses; Decision making; Digital storage; Hybrid systems; Relational database systems; Common architecture; Decision makers; Decision-making process; Hybrid storages; NoSQL system; RDBMS's; Relational Database; Storage architectures; Systems architecture; Traditional approaches; Decision support systems","","","","","","","International Journal of Computer and Information System Ijcis, (2020); Queiroz-Sousa, Paulo Orlando, A review on OLAP technologies applied to information networks, ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, 14, 1, (2019); J, (2019); International Journal of Knowledge Based Organizations, (2019); Int J Res Granthaalayah, (2019); Meier, Andreas, SQL & NoSQL Databases: Models, Languages, Consistency Options and Architectures for Big Data Management, SQL and NoSQL Databases: Models, Languages, Consistency Options and Architectures for Big Data Management, pp. 1-229, (2019); Siddiqa, Aisha, Big data storage technologies: a survey, Frontiers of Information Technology and Electronic Engineering, 18, 8, pp. 1040-1070, (2017); Bjeladinovic, Srdja, A fresh approach for hybrid SQL/NoSQL database design based on data structuredness, Enterprise Information Systems, 12, 8-9, pp. 1202-1220, (2018); Abbasi, Maryam, Nosql scalability performance evaluation over cassandra, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 111, pp. 512-520, (2019); Banerjee, Shreya, A unified conceptual model for data warehouses, Annals of Emerging Technologies in Computing, 5, Special issue 5, pp. 162-169, (2021)","L.

In view of the sanctions currently imposed on the Russian Federation, it is worth considering mainly open projects and/or domestic developments. We will highlight the main criteria that it is desirable to take into account when designing the architecture of an automated system to support the synthesis of new technical systems and technologies: (a) ability to store and process large amounts of data; (b) unification access for all data analysis procedures; (c) maximum automation of all stages; (d) modularity of the structure, focus on the expansion of functionality; (e) focus on open source solutions and software of domestic manufacturers, excluding rigid binding to paid foreign solutions. As a result of the work done, various aspects of the implementation of the required automated system were analyzed. A review of various software systems and cloud products showed that the concept of building data lakes (Data Lake) in conjunction with the distributed processing tools of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem is used for big data processing. An architecture framework based on a centralized data warehouse and Hadoop components is proposed. It will be possible to increase the functionality of the platform by adding new microservices that connect to the storage and distributed processing tools via the API, as well as using a single web service for managing and displaying data analysis results from these microservices. © 2023 IEEE.","architecture; information support; physical knowledge; search design","Automation; C (programming language); Computer architecture; Data handling; Digital storage; Information analysis; Lakes; Open source software; Open systems; Search engines; Web services; Access for all; Automated systems; Distributed processing; Information support; Large amounts of data; Physical knowledge; Processing tools; Russian federation; Search design; Technical systems; Data warehouses","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (23-21-00464); Russian Science Foundation, RSF","The study was supported by the grant of the Russian Science Foundation No. 23-21-00464, https://rscf.ru/en/project/23-21-00464/.","Report on the Activities of Rospatent for 2021; Hassani, Hossein, Text mining in big data analytics, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 4, 1, pp. 1-34, (2020); Sakr, Sherif, Encyclopedia of Big Data Technologies, Encyclopedia of Big Data Technologies, pp. 1-1820, (2019); Shekhar, Shashi, Encyclopedia of GIS, Encyclopedia of GIS, pp. 1-2507, (2017); Encyclopedia of Big Data Technologies, (2018); Practical Hadoop Ecosystem, (2016); Imasheva, Baktagul, The Practice of Moving to Big Data on the Case of the NoSQL Database, Clickhouse, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 991, pp. 820-828, (2020); Karras, Christos, Distributed Gibbs Sampling and LDA Modelling for Large Scale Big Data Management on PySpark, 7th South-East Europe Design Automation, Computer Engineering, Computer Networks and Social Media Conference, SEEDA-CECNSM 2022, (2022); ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, (2014); Zhao, Bo, ZenLDA: Large-scale topic model training on distributed data-parallel platform, Big Data Mining and Analytics, 1, 1, pp. 57-74, (2018)","A.

However, a fact which sometimes is ignored is that the oil and gas industry is an intensive energy-consumption industry and a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions as well. Recently, with the arrival of the ""double carbon""era, the energy-intensive production of oil and gas has caused people to pay more attention. Currently, big data technologies as well as the Internet of things (IoT) are developing at a rapid pace, and the metering infrastructure technology also shows huge advancement; oil and gas companies have built many information systems and developed many functions to acquire the energy consumption and oil production data for the aim of reducing the oil production cost via the emerging information technologies, and it turned out that these investments do improve the energy efficiency and lower oil production cost. Unfortunately, due to the different development standards, some systems store the same data with different values; so, therefore, there is a ""data barrier""among these systems and somehow discount the share and analysis of these data resources. To this end, in our work, based on these rich data resources from the other information systems, we discussed an intelligent energy management information system with four machine learning algorithms to enhance the analysis of data resources over energy consumption and oil production. First, we presented the innovation of energy consumption data fusion with the method ""Data Lake""; then, four different machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression (LR), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are installed in the proposed system for predicting the oil and gas production and total energy consumption. In order to aggregate these data into dashboard views that help managers make decisions about operations, we also demonstrated the process of energy consumption data visualization with emerging open-source software tool ECharts. Finally, a real life application of the proposed system was summarized in case of total energy consumption prediction and the system output shows good prediction accuracy which proves the feasibility and benefits of the intelligent energy management information system. © 2023 Jun Li et al.","","Costs; Data fusion; Data visualization; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Internet of things; Investments; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Open source software; Open systems; Support vector machines; Data resources; Energy consumption datum; Energy-consumption; Intelligent energy management; Machine learning algorithms; Oil and gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Oil-production; Production cost; Total energy; Energy utilization","","","","","","","undefined, (2019); Saadawi, Hisham N.H., Application of renewable energy in the oil and gas industry, SPE Middle East Oil and Gas Show and Conference, MEOS, Proceedings, 2019-March, (2019); Savazzi, Stefano, Ultra-wide band sensor networks in oil and gas explorations, IEEE Communications Magazine, 51, 4, pp. 150-160, (2013); Caraivan, Mitruţ Corneliu, Optimal location for underwater data collection sensor network nodes creating multi-purpose 'Safe-Nets' around offshore exploration areas, 2013 17th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing, ICSTCC 2013; Joint Conference of SINTES 2013, SACCS 2013, SIMSIS 2013 - Proceedings, pp. 601-606, (2013); Savazzi, Stefano, Synchronous ultra-wide band wireless sensors networks for oil and gas exploration, Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications, pp. 907-912, (2009); Dmitrievskiy, Anatoliy N., Digital transformation of gas production, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 700, 1, (2019); Zhang, Yue, Day-Ahead Power Output Forecasting for Small-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Electricity Generators, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 6, 5, pp. 2253-2262, (2015); Prema, V., Development of statistical time series models for solar power prediction, Renewable Energy, 83, pp. 100-109, (2015); Guo, Yabin, Machine learning-based thermal response time ahead energy demand prediction for building heating systems, Applied Energy, 221, pp. 16-27, (2018); Zhang, Fan, Time series forecasting for building energy consumption using weighted Support Vector Regression with differential evolution optimization technique, Energy and Buildings, 126, pp. 94-103, (2016)","J.

However, since the data is generally created utilizing liberal curation approaches such as crowd-sourcing and automatic extraction tools with no cross-validation on input data, the data is prone to errors that can be hidden in several dimensions. The types of errors which can be considered as outliers may occur in any part of RDF statements, especially in literal objects. Although some scientific studies have revealed anomalies in knowledge graphs, none of the current approaches has the ability to explain the anomalies that have been discovered. In this paper, we present ExPAD, a scalable and distributed framework for explainable numeric anomaly detection on very large RDF knowledge graphs. Inspired by OutlierTree, ExPAD generates human-readable explanations for a given numeric result being an outlier by following and assessing supervised decision tree splits. The proposed framework ExPAD is open-source, well-documented, and fully integrated into the Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA). Experiments on real-world use cases and synthetic datasets disclose that the framework can not only handle high volumes of RDF data but also efficiently generate explanations for hidden anomalies discovered in KGs. © 2023 IEEE.","Big Data; Decision Tree; Distributed Computing; Explainable Anomaly Detection; RDF; SANSA","Big data; Decision trees; Knowledge graph; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantics; Statistics; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection frameworks; Curation; Explainable anomaly detection; Heterogeneous data; Knowledge graphs; RDF; RDF data; Semantic analytic stack; Semantic-analytics","","","","","Horizon 2020, (872592)","This work was partly supported by the EU Horizon 2020 project PLATOON (GA no. 872592).","Identification of Outliers, (1980); Chandola, Varun, Anomaly detection: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 41, 3, (2009); A Roadmap to the Semantic Web, (1998); Vrandečič, Denny, Wikidata: A new platform for collaborative data collection, WWW'12 - Proceedings of the 21st Annual Conference on World Wide Web Companion, (2012); Auer, Sören, DBpedia: A nucleus for a Web of open data, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 4825 LNCS, pp. 722-735, (2007); Aaai, (2015); Explainable Outlier Detection Through Decision Tree Conditioning, (2020); Lehmann, Jens F., Distributed semantic analytics using the SANSA stack, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 10588 LNCS, pp. 147-155, (2017); Sansa Team, (2022); Interpretable Machine Learning, (2019)","F.B.

This raises many opportunities to develop new innovative telematics services, including, among others, driver safety, customer experience, location-based services and infotainment. Indeed, it is expected that there will be roughly 2 billion connected cars by the end of 2025 on the world's roadways, where each of which can produce up to 30 terabytes of data per day. Managing this big automotive data, in real and batch modes, imposes tight constraints on the underlying data management platform. To contribute to this research area, in this paper, we report on a real, in-production automotive big data platform; specifically, the one deployed by Groupe PSA (a French car manufacturer known also as Peugeot-Citroën). In particular, we present the technologies and open-source products used within the different components of this CV platform to gather, store, process, and leverage big automotive data.

Optical telemetry services will play a key role to enable advanced network awareness at device and component granularity. Optical disaggregation is pushing the adoption of open models, enabling multi-vendor interoperability, including telemetry. Moreover, due to whitebox programmability and the adoption of open source micro services, it is becoming feasible to monitor data streams from optical devices related to quality of transmission key performance indicators. Finally, due to mature big data analytics platforms, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, the telemetry data lake is processed to effectively detect network anomalies. However, current centralized telemetry architectures are prone to scalability issues, suboptimal soft failure recovery due to operational mode limitations, and/or the inability of the SDN controller of tuning finer or proprietary transmission parameters. Conversely, a number of soft failures might be detected and recovered directly at the optical card transmitter, often in a hitless fashion, also relying on optimized vendor-proprietary configurations. The paper proposes what we believe to be a novel peer-to-peer telemetry (P2PT) service ready for next generation digital coherent optics cards, for local processing and soft failure recovery at the transceiver agent level. The P2PT architecture, workflow, and subscription extensions are conceived to enable direct and fast recovery at the transceiver level, resorting to optical signal retuning and adaptations. Experimental evaluations, including lightweight machine learning detection at the card agent, are provided in a multi-vendor disaggregated optical network testbed to assess different soft failure use cases and P2PT service scalability. © 2009-2012 Optica Publishing Group.","","Benchmarking; Computer system recovery; Data Analytics; Fiber optic networks; Learning systems; Machine learning; Network architecture; Open source software; Recovery; Scalability; Advanced networks; Autonomic networking; Autonomics; Failure recovery; Machine-learning; Multi-vendor; Optical telemetry; Peer to peer; Soft failure; Software-defined networkings; Digital storage","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101016663); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","","Slavakis, Konstantinos, Modeling and optimization for big data analytics: (Statistical) learning tools for our era of data deluge, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 31, 5, pp. 18-31, (2014); Etsi Gs Zsm 002 V1 1 1 2019 08 2019; Network Telemetry Framework, (2022); Shariati, Behnam, Learning from the optical spectrum: Failure detection and identification, Journal of Lightwave Technology, 37, 2, pp. 433-440, (2019); Velasco, Luis, Building Autonomic Optical Whitebox-Based Networks, Journal of Lightwave Technology, 36, 15, pp. 3097-3104, (2018); Paolucci, Francesco, Network Telemetry Streaming Services in SDN-Based Disaggregated Optical Networks, Journal of Lightwave Technology, 36, 15, pp. 3142-3149, (2018); Vilalta, Ricard, Experimental evaluation of control and monitoring protocols for optical SDN networks and equipment [Invited Tutorial], Journal of Optical Communications and Networking, 13, 8, pp. D1-D12, (2021); Riccardi, Emilio, An Operator view on the Introduction of White Boxes into Optical Networks, Journal of Lightwave Technology, 36, 15, pp. 3062-3072, (2018); Hernández, José Alberto, A techno-economic study of optical network disaggregation employing open source software business models for metropolitan area networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 58, 5, pp. 40-46, (2020); Openconfig","F.

This process entails the transition towards smart energy-aware buildings that have lower consumptions and better efficiency performance. Digitalization is a key part of this process. A huge amount of data is currently generated by sensors, smart meters and a multitude of other devices and data sources, and this trend is expected to exponentially increase in the near future. Exploiting these data for different use cases spanning multiple application scenarios is of utmost importance to capture their full value and build smart and innovative building services. In this context, this paper presents a high-level architecture for big data management in the building domain which aims to foster data sharing, interoperability and the seamless integration of advanced services based on data-driven techniques. This work focuses on the functional description of the architecture, underlining the requirements and specifications to be addressed as well as the design principles to be followed. Moreover, a concrete example of the instantiation of such an architecture, based on open source software technologies, is presented and discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

The discovery and disposal of network security incidents are highly real-time in nature with seconds or even milliseconds response time to prevent possible cyber attacks and data leaks. In order to extract more valuable information, the log streams are analyzed using stream processing with pattern matching like CEP (Complex Event Processing) in memory, and then stored in a persistent storage systems such as a data warehouse system or a search engine system for data scientists and network security engineers to do OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). Sangfor needs to build a low-latency big data platform to meet the challenges of massive logs. More and more open source systems are proposed to solve the problem of data processing in a certain aspect. Many decisions must be made to balance the benefits when designing a real-time big data infrastructure. What’s more, how to architecture these systems and construct a one-stack unified big data platform have been the key obstacles for big data analytics. In this paper, we present the overall architecture of our low-latency big data infrastructure and identify four important design decisions i.e. message queue, stream processing, OLAP, and data lake. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of existing open source system and clarify the reason behind our choices. We also describe the improvements and optimizations to make the open-source stacks fit in Sangfor’s environments, including designing a real-time development platform based on Flink and re-architecting Apache Kylin, Clickhouse and Presto as a HOLAP system. Then we highlight two important use cases to verify the rationality of our infrastructure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Cybersecurity; Data Analytics; Data warehouses; Digital storage; Network architecture; Network security; Online systems; Open systems; Pattern matching; Search engines; Cyber security; Data infrastructure; Data platform; Detection device; End point detection; Low latency; Open source system; Real- time; Security threats; Stream processing; Big data","","","","","","","undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined","F.

It stores both transaction log and data files in one directory, and provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing on top of existing data lakes, such as S3, ADLS, GCS, and HDFS. Different from data warehouses, delta lakes allow data to be stored in the original format, retain complete data information, and provide efficient and low-cost storage solutions for data computing and analysis businesses. However, Since Delta Lake metadata is scattered in different resource files, the lack of a unified metadata view increases the difficulty of data governance. Also, Delta Lake adopts an open source storage system as the underlying storage, and its basic access control does not isolate different users, which may lead the risk of data leakage. At present, most common storage systems use data tables' row and column fields for access control, while delta lake treats the file group as an object. In this paper, aiming at the difficulty of data governance, we design a data lake metadata management method to achieve unified and efficient management of metadata information in heterogeneous data. Then, we design a policy-based data lake access control mechanism, combined with the open source permission framework, and complete the access request for different users and roles in Delta Lake. © 2022 IEEE.","Access Control; Data Lake; Delta Lake; Metadata","Access control; Batch data processing; Big data; Data warehouses; Digital storage; Information management; Metadata; Open systems; Access control systems; Data governances; Data lake; Data storage; Delta lake; Open-source; Policy based access control; Storage solutions; Storage systems; Transaction log; Lakes","","","","","(BA2021007); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62072099); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants No. 62072099, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Network and Information Security under Grants No.BM2003201, Jiangsu Provincial Scientific and Technological Achievements Transfer Fund (Grant No. BA2021007), Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration of Ministry of Education of China under Grants No.93K-9, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","Ouellette, Paul, Ronin: Data lake exploration, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 14, 12, pp. 2863-2866, (2021); Ravat, Franck, Data Lakes: Trends and Perspectives, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 11706 LNCS, pp. 304-313, (2019); Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, (2020); Ramakrishnan, Raghu, Azure Data Lake Store: A hyperscale distributed file service for big data analytics, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, Part F127746, pp. 51-63, (2017); Ramya, P., SecDedoop: Secure Deduplication with Access Control of Big Data in the HDFS/Hadoop Environment, Big Data, 8, 2, pp. 147-163, (2020); Chen, Congwei, HBD-Authority: Streaming Access Control Model for Hadoop, Proceedings - 2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud and Big Data Systems and Application, DependSys 2020, pp. 16-25, (2020); Uniform Access to Multiform Data Lakes Using Semantic Technologies 2019 C Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Information Integration and Web Based Applications Services Iiwas 19; Nargesian, Fatemeh, Organizing Data Lakes for Navigation, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1939-1950, (2020); Zhang, Yi, Finding Related Tables in Data Lakes for Interactive Data Science, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1951-1966, (2020); Bogatu, Alex, Dataset discovery in data lakes, Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering, 2020-April, pp. 709-720, (2020)","Z.

In many cases, this can be as time-consuming as the analysis itself. It requires downloading multiple public databases with various data structures, and in general, spending days preparing the data before answering any biological questions. Here, we introduce Sherlock, an open-source, cloud-based big data platform ( https://earlham-sherlock.github.io/) to solve this problem. Sherlock provides a gap-filling way for computational biologists to store, convert, query, share and generate biology data while ultimately streamlining bioinformatics data management. The Sherlock platform offers a simple interface to leverage big data technologies, such as Docker and PrestoDB. Sherlock is designed to enable users to analyze, process, query and extract information from extremely complex and large data sets. Furthermore, Sherlock can handle different structured data (interaction, localization, or genomic sequence) from several sources and convert them to a common optimized storage format, for example, the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC). This format facilitates Sherlock's ability to quickly and efficiently execute distributed analytical queries on extremely large data files and share datasets between teams. The Sherlock platform is freely available on GitHub, and contains specific loader scripts for structured data sources of genomics, interaction and expression databases. With these loader scripts, users can easily and quickly create and work with specific file formats, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or ORC. For computational biology and large-scale bioinformatics projects, Sherlock provides an open-source platform empowering data management, analytics, integration and collaboration through modern big data technologies. © 2022 Bohar B et al.","Big data; Computational biology; Data integration; Data lake; Data management; Network biology; Software; Systems biology","article; big data; bioinformatics; biologist; data integration; genomics; human; shipyard worker; software; systems biology","","","","","(BB/CSP17270/1, BB/J004529/1, BB/P016774/1); (BBS/E/F/000PR10355, BB/R012490/1); (BB/S50743X/1); (BB/R50659X/1); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (BBS/E/F/000PR10353); (BB/M011216/1)","We would like to thank all of the members of the Korcsmaros Group for their advice and feedback.

The method uses open-source big data technology frameworks such as Kafka, Flink, Elasticsearch, etc. to complete the collection, analysis, storage and visual display of massive power mobile application data, and improve the throughput of data processing. The security situation awareness method of power mobile application takes the mobile terminal threat index as the core, divides the risk level for the mobile terminal, and predicts the terminal threat index through support vector machine regression algorithm (SVR), so as to construct the security profile of the mobile application operation terminal. Finally, through visualization services, various data such as power mobile applications and terminal assets, security operation statistics, security strategies, and alarm analysis are displayed to guide security operation and maintenance personnel to carry out power mobile application security monitoring and early warning, banning disposal and traceability analysis and other decision-making work. The experimental analysis results show that the method can meet the requirements of security situation awareness for threat assessment accuracy and response speed, and the related results have been well applied in a power company. © 2022 IEEE.","big data architecture; component;situational awareness; power mobile application; SVR; terminal threat index","Computer terminals; Data handling; Data visualization; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric utilities; Mobile computing; Support vector machines; Big data architecture; Component;; Data architectures; Mobile applications; Power; Power mobile application; Security situation; Situational awareness; SVR; Terminal threat index; Big data","","","","","State Grid Corporation of China, SGCC, (5700-202158183A-0-0-00); State Grid Corporation of China, SGCC","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by the science and technology project of State Grid Corporation of China: ""Research on Dynamic Access Authentication and Trust Evaluation Technology of Power Mobile Internet Services Based on Zero Trust"" (Grand No. 5700-202158183A-0-0-00).","Information Security Technology Baseline for Classified Protection of Cybersecurity S; Gong, Jian, Survey of Network Security Situation Awareness, Ruan Jian Xue Bao/Journal of Software, 28, 4, pp. 1010-1026, (2017); Computer Science, (2020); Kou, Guang, Research on key technologies of network security situational awareness for attack tracking prediction, Chinese Journal of Electronics, 28, 1, pp. 162-171, (2019); Dietterich, Thomas G., Machine learning methods for high level cyber situation awareness, Advances in Information Security, 46, pp. 227-247, (2010); Dapoigny, Richard, Formal foundations for situation awareness based on dependent type theory, Information Fusion, 14, 1, pp. 87-107, (2013); Ding, Huadong, Network security situation awareness model based on Bayesian method, Jisuanji Gongcheng/Computer Engineering, 46, 6, pp. 130-135, (2020); Xi, Rongrong, An improved quantitative evaluation method for network security, Jisuanji Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Computers, 38, 4, pp. 749-758, (2015); Research on Network Security Situation Awareness Based on Data Mining, (2019); Research and Application of Attack Modeling in the Mobile Internet, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas Manila; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; The International Society for Applied Computing (ISAC)","5th International Conference on Data Science and Information Technology, DSIT 2022","2022-07-22 through 2022-07-24","Shanghai","184487","","9781665498685","","","English","Int.

This paper presents a Multi-source Heterogeneous Data of Medical Lakehouse (MHDML), the platform that integrates multiple pieces of open-source software reasonably to integrate more comprehensive multi-source heterogeneous medical data. Multi-modal data fusion is an important method of the platform to improve multi-modal data management in the medical field. Finally, we customize Restful APIs for medical data exploration tasks.

This solution covers higher education institutions' requirements for managing large volumes generated by their students and teachers. This work deals with the problem of the lack of organization when implementing a data lake due to the fact that there are no well-known or standardized methods for its administration. Our methodology proposes dividing the data lake into three zones: (1) landing tier, (2) staging tier, and (3) consumption tier, and transforming the data for each zone under the guidance of the Common Data Model and One Data Model. The main goal is to avoid the educational data lake from converting into a data swamp. This methodology was implemented at University as a case study over an open-source data lake environment. The results obtained figures that historical data analysis barriers are overcome thanks to the high capabilities of the data lake. In addition, this approach can be applied to other institutions with great flexibility, with commodity solutions, and regardless of the source data format. © 2022 IEEE.","big data; common data model; data lake; education; HDFS; one data model","Big data; Education computing; Metadata; Analytical systems; Common data model; Data lake; HDFS; Higher education institutions; Lake management; Large volumes; One data model; Standardized methods; Teachers'; Lakes","","","","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENT Authors thank UISEK 2022 research call (project P04 2122), for funding the data lake implementation.","Martínez-Mosquera, Diana, Modeling and management big data in databases-A systematic literature review, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 2, (2020); Gartner S 2015 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies Identifies the Computing Innovations that Organizations Should Monitor, (2015); Villegas-Ch, William Eduardo, Big data, the next step in the evolution of educational data analysis, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 721, pp. 138-147, (2018); Apache Hadoop 3 2 3, (2022); NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework, (2019); Next Generation Databases Nosql Newsql and Big Data, (2015); Ijaz Baig, Maria, Big data in education: a state of the art, limitations, and future research directions, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, (2020); Li, Yi, Review and Prospect of Modern Education using Big Data, Procedia Computer Science, 129, pp. 341-347, (2018); International Journal of Emerging Trends in Engineering Research, (2020); Chaurasia, Sushil S., Big data academic and learning analytics: Connecting the dots for academic excellence in higher education, International Journal of Educational Management, 32, 6, pp. 1099-1117, (2018)","","Lalaleo, D.R.; Huerta, M.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","6th IEEE Ecuador Technical Chapters Meeting, ETCM 2022","2022-10-11 through 2022-10-14","Quito","184196","","9781665487443","","","English","IEEE Ecuador Tech.

This has resulted in vast amounts of data becoming available in a variety of forms and formats including RDF. As RDF data have been created by liberal curation methods (e.g. crowd-sourcing and automatic extraction tools with limited restriction and cross-validation on input data), they are prone to various kinds of errors that can be hidden in different dimensions (i.e. subject, predicate, and object level). Detecting those errors not only improves the KGs quality but also makes it possible to detect anomalous events in the data which can be used for subsequent analysis. In this paper, we present DistAD, a generic, scalable, and distributed framework for anomaly detection on large RDF knowledge graphs. DistAD provides a great granularity for the end-users to select from a vast number of different algorithms, methods, and (hyper-)parameters to detect outliers. The proposed framework is fully open-source, well-documented, and fully integrated into the active community project Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA). The experiments on real-world use cases disclose that the framework is not only able to handle huge RDF data but also able to successfully detect hidden anomalies/outliers in KGs. © 2022 IEEE.","Anomaly Detection; Big Data; Distributed Computing; RDF Graph; SANSA; Scalable Analytics","Big data; Object detection; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantics; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection frameworks; Data generation; Data maintenance; Heterogeneous data; RDF data; RDF graph; Scalable analytic; Semantic analytic stack; Semantic-analytics","","","","","Horizon 2020; (872592)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partly supported by the EU Horizon 2020 project PLATOON (GA no. 872592).

In this paper, we propose a big data framework suitable for pre-processing and classification of image as well as text analytics by employing two key workflows, called big data (BD) pipeline and machine learning (ML) pipeline. Our unique end-to-end workflow integrates data cleansing, data integration, data transformation and data reduction processes, followed by various analytics using suitable machine learning techniques. Further, our model is the first of its kind to augment facial recognition with sentiment analysis in a distributed big data framework. The implementation of our model uses state-of-the-art distributed technologies to ingest, prepare, process and analyze big data for generating actionable data insights by employing relevant ML algorithms such as k-NN, logistic regression and decision tree. In addition, we demonstrate the application of our big data framework to facial recognition system using open sources by developing a prototype as a use case. We also employ sentiment analysis on non-repetitive semi structured public data (text) such as user comments, image tagging, and other information associated with the facial images. We believe our work provides a novel approach to intersect Big Data, ML and Face Recognition and would create new research to alleviate some of the challenges associated with big data processing in real world applications. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

In many cases this can be as time-consuming as the analysis itself, requiring downloading multiple different public databases, with different data structures, and in general, spending days before answering any biological questions. To solve this problem, we introduce an open-source, cloud-based big data platform, called Sherlock ( https://earlham-sherlock.github.io/). Sherlock provides a gap-filling way for biologists to store, convert, query, share and generate biology data, while ultimately streamlining bioinformatics data management. The Sherlock platform provides a simple interface to leverage big data technologies, such as Docker and PrestoDB. Sherlock is designed to analyse, process, query and extract the information from extremely complex and large data sets. Furthermore, Sherlock is capable of handling different structured data (interaction, localization, or genomic sequence) from several sources and converting them to a common optimized storage format, for example to the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC). This format facilitates Sherlock's ability to quickly and easily execute distributed analytical queries on extremely large data files as well as share datasets between teams. The Sherlock platform is freely available on Github, and contains specific loader scripts for structured data sources of genomics, interaction and expression databases. With these loader scripts, users are able to easily and quickly create and work with the specific file formats, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or ORC. For computational biology and large-scale bioinformatics projects, Sherlock provides an open-source platform empowering data management, data analytics, data integration and collaboration through modern big data technologies. © 2021 Bohar B et al.","Big data; Computational biology; Data integration; Data lake; Data management; Network biology; Software; Systems biology","article; big data; bioinformatics; biologist; data integration; genomics; human; shipyard worker; software; systems biology","","","","","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC, (BBS/E/T/000PR9818); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (BBS/E/F/000PR10353)","","Ashburner, Michael, Gene ontology: Tool for the unification of biology, Nature Genetics, 25, 1, pp. 25-29, (2000); Zenodo, (2021); Bastian, Frederic B., The Bgee suite: Integrated curated expression atlas and comparative transcriptomics in animals, Nucleic Acids Research, 49, D1, pp. D831-D847, (2021); Calderone, Alberto, Mentha: A resource for browsing integrated protein-interaction networks, Nature Methods, 10, 8, pp. 690-691, (2013); Das, Jishnu, HINT: High-quality protein interactomes and their applications in understanding human disease, BMC Systems Biology, 6, (2012); Dean, Jeffrey, MapReduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters, Communications of the ACM, 51, 1, pp. 107-113, (2008); García-Alonso, Luz, Transcription factor activities enhance markers of drug sensitivity in cancer, Cancer Research, 78, 3, pp. 769-780, (2018); Greene, Casey S., Big data bioinformatics, Journal of Cellular Physiology, 229, 12, pp. 1896-1900, (2014); Dual Proteome Scale Networks Reveal Cell Specific Remodeling of the Human Interactome, (2020); Kasson, Peter M., Computational biology in the cloud: Methods and new insights from computing at scale, Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, pp. 451-453, (2013)","T.

The main tasks in processing big data are data acquisition, data storage, data management, data processing and applying data analytics. The earlier generations of data repositories are data warehouses that store the structured datasets and enable customers to view and mine data in different dimensions. Data warehouses and data marts are assumed to provide solutions to end-users for making decisions from the data. However, data warehouses store only structured data and unable to maintain massive repositories of different types of heterogeneous datasets. The most recently developed technologies are data lakes (DLs) that store a voluminous amount of datasets with heterogeneous kinds of data from diverse sources. In this chapter, we explore the concept of a DL, big data fabric, DL architecture and various layers of a DL. We also present various components of each of the layers that exist in a DL. We compare and contrast the notion of data warehouses and DLs concerning some key characteristics. Moreover, we explore various commercial- and open-source-based DLs with their strengths and limitations. Also, we discuss some of the key best practices for DLs. Further, we present two case studies of DLs: Lumada data lake (LDL) and Temenos data lake (TDL) for digital banking. Finally, we explore some of the crucial challenges that are facing in the formation of DLs. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2021.","Bank data processing; Big data; Big data analytics; Big data fabric; Data analysis; Data handling techniques; Data warehouses; Digital banking; DL architecture; Financial computing; Lumada data lake; Open source data lake; Other DBMS; Temenos data lake","","","","","","","","Chen, Min, Big data: A survey, Mobile Networks and Applications, 19, 2, pp. 171-209, (2014); Rao, T.

This poses a particular problem for cross-device comparisons and machine learning applications, which rely on large quantities of data from multiple sources. To address these challenges, the open-source Time-Series Data Pipelines (Tsdat) Python framework was developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, with strategic guidance and direction provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories to facilitate collaboration and accelerate advancements in the marine energy domain through the development of an open-source ecosystem of tools.

Several companies integrated legacy relational databases with semantic technologies using Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA). In practice, this approach enables the analysts to write SPARQL queries both over KGs and SQL relational data sources by making transparent most of the implementation details. However, the volume of data is continuously increasing, and a growing number of companies are adopting distributed storage platforms and distributed computing engines. There is a gap between big data and semantic technologies. Ontop, one of the reference OBDA systems, is limited to legacy relational databases, and the compatibility with the big data analytics engine Apache Spark is still missing. This paper introduces Chimera, an open-source software suite that aims at filling such a gap. Chimera enables a new type of round-tripping data science pipelines. Data Scientists can query data stored in a data lake using SPARQL through Ontop and SparkSQL while saving the semantic results of such analysis back in the data lake. This new type of pipelines semantically enriches data from Spark before saving them back. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Analytics; Apache spark; Big data; Knowledge graph; Ontology based data access; Semantic technologies","Data Analytics; Digital storage; Engines; Knowledge graph; Lakes; Ontology; Open source software; Open systems; Pipelines; Semantics; Analytic; Apache spark; Data analytics; Data semantics; Data-source; Knowledge graphs; Ontology-based data access; Relational data; Relational Database; Semantic technologies; Big data","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements.

More concretely, we propose a data model made of both textual and CSV documents, a workload model composed of a set of various tasks, as well as a set of performance-based metrics, all relevant to the context of data lakes.

Additionally, the system has been validated for three use cases: cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension (HPN) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which were selected for their incidence in the population. This system is innovative within e-health, mainly due to the use of a big data architecture based on open-source components, also it provides a scalable and distributed environment for storage and processing of biomedical sensor data.

Thus, it is important to use the flexibility in device loads to shift energy consumption to follow the production. For example, an Electrical Vehicle (EV) can be charged very flexibly between arriving home at 5PM and leaving again at 7AM. Utilizing all available energy flexibility requires applying machine learning and AI on massive amounts of Big Data from many different actors and devices, ranging from private consumers, over companies, to energy network operators, and using this to create digital solutions to enable and exploit flexibility. The project Flexible Energy Denmark (FED) is building the foundation for this for the entire Danish society. Specifically, FED collects data from a number of Living Labs (LLs) in representative real-life physical environments. The data is stored in the Danish National Energy Data Lake, called FED Data Lake (FEDDL) to enable efficient and advanced analysis. FEDDL is built using only open source tools which can run both on-premise and in cloud settings.

These data management challenges are largely posed by the availability of streaming data at high velocity from various sources in multiple formats. The changes in data paradigm have led to the emergence of new data analytics and management architecture. This paper focuses on storing high volume, velocity and variety data in the raw formats in a data storage architecture called a data lake. First, we present our study on the limitations of traditional data warehouses in handling recent changes in data paradigms. We discuss and compare different open source and commercial platforms that can be used to develop a data lake.

[30], and DAvinCi - an abbreviation of Distributed Agents with Collective Intelligence [3]. During its lifespan, RoboEarth focused on providing a knowledge sharing database for autonomous robots to perform tasks such as object detection. The overall goal was that by querying the RoboEarth system, robots can improve their performance speed and reliability since known models or knowledge of different environments could be shared and then enhanced by the robot - rather than requiring the robot to collect new information. The database stored other properties such as object types, location where the object was detected etc. The integral components of the database are hierarchical tables, a graph database which contains the data and their semantic relationships. The queries are passed through semantic querying language. This project was funded by the European Union from 2010 - 2014, and is no longer active. Similarly, DAvinCi focused on developing a platform for offloading computational intensive tasks. They implemented this system by combining Hadoop’s Map/Reduce framework [2] with the Robot Operating System (ROS) architecture [3]. Unfortunately, the implementation details of this project have been kept private - which we note is common in other cloud robotics literature.","Alam, Kazi Md Rokibul, A comparison between traceable and untraceable blind signature schemes through simulation, 2013 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision, ICIEV 2013, (2013); Hadoop; Arumugam, Rajesh Vellore, DAvinCi: A cloud computing framework for service robots, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 3084-3089, (2010); Robomaker; Ayush, Kumar, Real time visual SLAM using cloud computing, 2013 4th International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies, ICCCNT 2013, (2013); Boehm, Jan, Nosql for storage and retrieval of large lidar data collections, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 40, 3W3, pp. 577-582, (2015); Cardenas, Irvin Steve, Design of a Semi-Humanoid Telepresence Robot for Plant Disaster Response and Prevention, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 2748-2753, (2019); Gudi, Siva Leela Krishna Chand, Fog robotics for efficient, fluent and robust human-robot interaction, NCA 2018 - 2018 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications, (2018); Chen, Yinong, Robot as a service in cloud computing, Proceedings - 5th IEEE International Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering, SOSE 2010, pp. 151-158, (2010); Kafka Rest Proxy","","Chakrabarti, S.; Paul, R.; Gill, B.; Gangopadhyay, M.; Poddar, S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Vancouver Section; Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM); SMART; University of Engineering and Management (UEM)","2020 IEEE International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference, IEMTRONICS 2020","2020-09-09 through 2020-09-12","Vancouver","163882","","9781728196152","","","English","IEMTRONICS - Int.

A novel hybrid architecture is proposed to combine stream processing and batch processing of big data for a smart computation of microservice-oriented transportation metrics that can serve the different needs of stakeholders.

New data sources, such as social media, digitized cultural content, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have allowed us to enrich and customize the cultural experience, but at the same time have created an avalanche of new data that needs to be stored and appropriately managed in order to be of value. Although data management plays a central role in driving forward the cultural heritage domain, the solutions applied so far are fragmented, physically distributed, require specialized IT knowledge to deploy, and entail significant IT experience to operate even for trivial tasks. In this work, we present Hydria, an online data lake that allows users without any IT background to harvest, store, organize, analyze and share heterogeneous, multi-faceted cultural heritage data. Hydria provides a zero-administration, zero-cost, integrated framework that enables researchers, museum curators and other stakeholders within the cultural heritage domain to easily (i) deploy data acquisition services (like social media scrapers, focused web crawlers, dataset imports, questionnaire forms), (ii) design and manage versatile customizable data stores, (iii) share whole datasets or horizontal/vertical data shards with other stakeholders, (iv) search, filter and analyze data via an expressive yet simple-to-use graphical query engine and visualization tools, and (v) perform user management and access control operations on the stored data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution in the literature that focuses on collecting, managing, analyzing, and sharing diverse, multi-faceted data in the cultural heritage domain and targets users without an IT background. © 2020 by the authors.

Indeed, the role of big data in IoT is tremendous as IoT is projected to include billions of connected devices, producing a massive amounts of data within a few years. In this context, big data analytics is a key enabler for unlocking the untapped potential of the IoT and fueling a wide range of data-driven products, services, and business processes. Apache Hadoop is the most prominent and used tool in big data. Hadoop is an open source framework that enables distributed processing of large data sets across commodity clusters. It is designed to scale with built-in high availability and reliability. Additional open source projects have been built around the original Hadoop implementation with the addition of Apache Spark. Spark is the next hype in the industry among the big data tools which was designed to address the shortcomings of Hadoop. Spark provides primitives for in-memory cluster computing which can speed jobs that run on the Hadoop data processing platform.

The new proposed approach to manage real-time data is based on the use of distributed storage and processing technologies to simultaneously analyze large volumes of information, previously considered only on an individual well basis. This new approach leverages the open source technology available in the market to target the gathering of the data, its secure database storage, and its future processing in a single workflow, to obtain the most value added from the oilfield-generated data during D&C operations. This work presents a set of big data tools and their application. For this case study, a dynamic, open, easily configurable, and fully scalable work environment was obtained. Open source big data technologies prove to be different when handling operations data, as compared to traditional technologies. Traditional technologies typically require several manual inputs and configurations to enter the data. Data models for these technologies are usually closed or proprietary, and the provided visualizations are limited either to single well analysis or to basic analytical dashboards. The technologies used for this case fully enable data input and storage, as well as allow the generation and real-time deployment of machine learning and data science algorithms and models. As a different approach, this paper introduces the use of big data architectures for the D&C business to obtain better results for gathering, storing, and analyzing real-time information than the business has traditionally achieved. © © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers","","Big data; C (programming language); Data Science; Data streams; Engineering education; Gasoline; Machine learning; Markup languages; Oil well completion; Oil wells; Open Data; Data architectures; Distributed storage; Drilling and completion; Information transfers; Open-source technology; Processing technologies; Real-time information; Work environments; Digital storage","","","","","","","De Mauro, Andrea, A formal definition of Big Data based on its essential features, Library Review, 65, 3, pp. 122-135, (2016); Jantzen, Ronald E., Wellsite information transfer specification (WITS) for digital rig-site data, SPE drilling engineering, 4, 4, pp. 291-299 16141, (1989); Madasu, Srinath, Deep recurrent neural network DrNN model for real-time step-down analysis, Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Reservoir Characterisation and Simulation Conference and Exhibition 2019, RCSC 2019, (2019); Pessier, Rudolf C.O., Drilling performance is a function of power at the bit and drilling efficiency, SPE/IADC Drilling Conference, Proceedings, 2, pp. 825-840, (2012)","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)","","SPE Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference 2020, LACPEC 2020","2020-07-27 through 2020-07-31","Virtual, Online","161874","","9781613999905; 9781510841956; 9781555635138; 9781555633653; 9781555634018; 9781615670994; 9781617821837; 9781613990063; 9781622760466; 9781613996539","85OLA","","English","SPE Lat Am Caribb Pet Eng Conf Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090507638"

The typical approach used to identify biospecimens is a manual, retrospective process that exists outside the clinical workflow. This often makes biospecimen collection cost prohibitive and prevents the collection of analytes with short stability times. Emerging data architectures offer novel approaches to enhance specimen-identification practices. To this end, we present a new tool that can be deployed in a real-time environment to automate the identification and notification of available biospecimens for biomedical research. Methods: Real-time clinical and laboratory data from Cloverleaf (Infor, NY, NY) were acquired within our computational health platform, which is built on open-source applications. Study-specific filters were developed in NiFi (Apache Software Foundation, Wakefield, MA, USA) to identify the study-appropriate specimens in real time. Specimen metadata were stored in Elasticsearch (Elastic N. V., Mountain View, CA, USA) for visualization and automated alerting. Results: Between June 2018 and December 2018, we identified 2992 unique specimens belonging to 2815 unique patients, split between two different use cases. Based on laboratory policy for specimen retention and study-specific stability requirements, secure E-mail notifications were sent to investigators to automatically notify of availability. The assessment of throughput on commodity hardware demonstrates the ability to scale to approximately 2000 results per second. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that real-world clinical data can be analyzed in real time to increase the efficiency of biospecimen identification with minimal overhead for the clinical laboratory. Future work will integrate additional data types, including the analysis of unstructured data, to enable more complex cases and biospecimen identification. © 2020 Journal of Pathology Informatics | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Biobanking; biomedical research; biospecimen science; clinical specimens; real-time identification; translational research","","","","","","","","van Ommen, Gert Jan B., BBMRI-ERIC as a resource for pharmaceutical and life science industries: The development of biobank-based Expert Centres, European Journal of Human Genetics, 23, 7, pp. 893-900, (2015); Langhof, Holger, Current practices for access, compensation, and prioritization in biobanks.

Due to their high heterogeneity, it is a challenge to build systems to centrally process and analyze efficiently such data which are internal and external to organizations. A Big data architecture describes the blueprint of a system handling massive volume of data during its storage, processing, analysis and visualization. Several architectures belonging to different categories have been proposed by academia and industry but the field is still lacking benchmarks. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the existing architectures is required in order to ease the choice between architectures for specific use cases or industry requirements. The types of data sources, the hardware requirements, the maximum tolerable latency, the fitment to industry, the amount of data to be handled are some of the factors that need to be considered carefully before making the choice of an architecture of a Big Data system. However, the wrong choice of architecture can result in huge decline for a company reputation and business. This paper reviews the most prominent existing Big Data architectures, their advantages and shortcomings, their hardware requirements, their open source and proprietary software requirements and some of their real-world use cases catering to each industry. The purpose of this body of work is to equip Big Data architects with the necessary resources to make better informed choices to design optimal Big Data systems. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

It is usually not enough to just store everything. Data needs to be stored in such a way that enables users to quickly access and manipulate it. There are many ingestion-specific solutions in the big data ecosystem. This paper will describe an implemented system for data ingestion from MSSQL, MySQL and Postgres into a Hive database. The process starts with creating tables with corresponding metadata, continues with the ingestion process and ends with a description of how the process is automated. The implementation of Sqoop as an open-source tool and Hue, a web user interface from Cloudera, will be described. © 42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.

Storing and analyzing these data to implement precision medicine initiatives and data-driven research has exceeded the capabilities of traditional computer systems. Modern big data platforms must be adapted to the specific demands of health care and designed for scalability and growth. Objective: The objectives of our study were to (1) demonstrate the implementation of a data science platform built on open source technology within a large, academic health care system and (2) describe 2 computational health care applications built on such a platform. Methods: We deployed a data science platform based on several open source technologies to support real-time, big data workloads. We developed data-acquisition workflows for Apache Storm and NiFi in Java and Python to capture patient monitoring and laboratory data for downstream analytics. Results: Emerging data management approaches, along with open source technologies such as Hadoop, can be used to create integrated data lakes to store large, real-time datasets. This infrastructure also provides a robust analytics platform where health care and biomedical research data can be analyzed in near real time for precision medicine and computational health care use cases. Conclusions: The implementation and use of integrated data science platforms offer organizations the opportunity to combine traditional datasets, including data from the electronic health record, with emerging big data sources, such as continuous patient monitoring and real-time laboratory results. These platforms can enable cost-effective and scalable analytics for the information that will be key to the delivery of precision medicine initiatives. Organizations that can take advantage of the technical advances found in data science platforms will have the opportunity to provide comprehensive access to health care data for computational health care and precision medicine research. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The proliferation and dissemination of flight, weather, aeronautical, and environmental data by all air traffic participants represents a treasure trove of air traffic optimization opportunities awaiting to be exploited. Traditional data exploitation methods and tools tend to rely on structured data stores and analytical capability architected to answer defined and current questions. SGT, in collaboration with the US DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, developed a prototype air transportation cloud based Data Lake to harness big data from a variety of sources and build the current and next generation of analytics capability. The Data Lake prototype ingests data from multiple sources including FAA sources like SFDPS, TFMData, TBFM, STDDS, ITWS, and AEDT data sources, and stores it in raw, processed, and refined format. The prototype offers an illustration for how users can realize powerful air traffic related data analysis using structured, unstructured and semi-structured data using open source tools to execute queries, searches, processing streams and to visualize data. Using a combination of traditional SQL and NOSQL, Open-Source and COTS products - PostgreSQL, Elastic-Logstash-Kibana, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark and visualization tools like Tableau, D3 and others, the project shows how analysts can quickly and easily build powerful data pipelines and statistical models. © 2018 IEEE.","Data analytics; Data lake; Volpe","Air traffic control; Air transportation; Aviation; Data Analytics; Data visualization; Digital avionics; Information analysis; Interoperability; Lakes; Air Traffic Management; Environmental data; Information sharing; Semi structured data; System interoperability; Visualization tools; Volpe; Volpe National Transportation Systems; Information management","","","","","","","undefined","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","AESS; AIAA; DATC; et al.; IEEE; NASA","37th IEEE/AIAA International Digital Avionics Systems Conference, DASC 2018","2018-09-23 through 2018-09-27","London","143574","21557195","1424411084; 9781479950010; 9781424403783; 9781538641125; 9781424440788; 9781665486071; 9781424466160; 9781467316996; 9781665434201; 9781728106496","ADACF","","English","AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060619514"

Banking risks come from many channels and systems. Big data technology provides an innovative and effective solution for data management, and thus is suitable to be applied in the risk management scenarios that require high-quality data and complex data analysis. This paper firstly proposes big data architecture of hybrid processing engines and databases.

With this perspective, this study investigates sustainable energy consumption in the industrial and mining sectors. Although these sectors are experiencing exponential data growth, their adoption of big data technologies is limited. Hence, big data methods were applied to design a big data system that makes novel use of microservices and containers for modularity and extensibility. A hybrid architecture incorporating characteristics from polyglot persistence, data lakes and Lambda architecture was used. MongoDB served as the primary data store. The system was implemented for an engineering services company. The implementation yielded seven case studies, which illustrate the impact of big data on decision-making at the various levels of the hierarchy within an organisation. Valuable insights were delivered to personnel at the different levels of the organisational hierarchy. By developing these insights, directed at the appropriate personnel, improved decisions were taken and suitable actions initiated to achieve sustainable energy consumption reductions. The overall impact of the case studies was an energy saving of 75 622 MWh, a reduction of 74 111 Mg of carbon-dioxide-emission, and a saving of 108 141 m3 of water. Sustained reductions in energy consumption result in cleaner production and will eventually aid in addressing the various energy challenges confronting the economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Containers; Hybrid architecture; Microservices; Organisational hierarchy insights; Sustainable energy consumption","Carbon dioxide; Containers; Data mining; Decision making; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Global warming; Magnesium compounds; Personnel; Pollution control; Big data technologies; Carbon dioxide emissions; Engineering service; Hybrid architectures; Microservices; Organisational; Production and consumption; Sustainable energy; Big data","","","","","","","Atabani, A.

Hadoop was developed to analyze large scale data repository in a parallel computing architecture. The main task in this process is to handle this 'Big Data' by applying proper strategies. So, present industry is focusing on the methods in which this 'Big Data' can be used for their business growth. There's no suspicion that the setup of Data Lake on hadoop can provide a new way of analytics and intuition analysis. Beyond experimentations and POCs, today Hadoop is considered more into production. As we are moving towards the stage where Hadoop is considered for real-time production scenarios and major chunk of the production data is normally sensitive, or subject to many control measures, it becomes high priority to consider the security aspects in hadoop before deciding on Hadoop installation for any enterprise. This paper evaluates various issues in Hadoop ecosystem and its popular distributions by top big data players in the market. It further intends to investigate and compare the current security features being provided in those big data distributions along with other open source big data security solutions to help in building secure big data environment. © 2017 IEEE.","Big Data; Hadoop; Hadoop Security Tools; Hadoop Tools-Security Comparision; Security Measures","Parallel architectures; Security systems; Comparision; Hadoop; Large scale data; Parallel computing architecture; Real-time production; Security features; Security measure; Security tools; Big data","","","","","","","Cloudera Security, (2016); Big Data Security Gap Protecting the Hadoop Cluster, (2016); Securing Hadoop Security Recommendations for Hadoop Environments, (2016); Welcome to Apache Hadoop, (2014); Big Data Analytics for Security Intelligence, (2013); Big Data Taxonomy, (2014); Top Ten Big Data Security and Privacy Challenges, (2012); How Data Science at Barclays is Helping to Make A Difference, (2016); Priyadharshini, M.

The framework leverages a sustainable crowdsourcing incentive model for both the ad hoc crowd and the IoT infrastructure provider. The proposed sustainable framework can potentially support context-Aware smart city services such as finding a lost person within the crowd, showing green and health risk prone zones, semantic and location-Aware notifications of events of interest, semantic IoT-based routing, and dealing with emergency situations.

The difficulty in ingestion, processing, storage and visualisation of this data has forced industries to use big data systems. Such systems can be classified in stages of a data pipeline; namely the ingestion stage responsible for high volume data acquisition, a distributed message queue stage enabling the other stages to consume data in high performance, a realtime event processing stage for analytics and detecting anomalies and a storage engine for storing raw data and lastly a visualization stage for realtime result displaying. Open source big data systems have solutions for all stages, but they should be customized to solve problems specific to each project. As examples; making data ingestion layer highly available, decoupling the storage and realtime visualisation layer in pipeline in order to enable the user see status of devices even there is a problem in storage layer or increasing message queue performance by using a different internal serialization format can be given.

This task is challenging as in today's knowledge-, service-, and cloud- based economy, businesses accumulate massive amounts of raw data from a variety of sources. Data Lakes introduced as a storage repository to organize this raw data in its native format (supporting from relational to NoSQL DBs) until it is needed. The rationale behind a Data Lake is to store raw data and let the data analyst decide how to cook/curate them later. In this paper, we present the notion of Knowledge Lake, i.e. a contextualized Data Lake. The Knowledge Lake will provide the foundation for big data analytics by automatically curating the raw data in the Data Lake and to prepare them for deriving insights. We present CoreKG -an open source Data and Knowledge Lake service- which offers researchers and developers a single REST API to organize, curate, index and query their data and metadata in the Lake and over time.

In these environments, log data of network traffic is usually large, coming at highspeed, and have various formats, the classic case of big data problem. This makes anomaly detection very difficult due to the fact that to get good accuracy, large amount of data must be processed in real-time. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid architecture for network traffic anomaly detection using popular big data framework including Apache Spark and Apache Flume. To demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed solution, we implement a SARIMA-based anomaly detection as a case study. The experimental results clearly indicated that our proposed architecture allows anomaly detection with good accuracy in large-scale environment effectively.","Big Data; Hybrid Processing; Lambda Architecture; Log Processing; Real-Time","Data handling; HIgh speed networks; Network architecture; Anomaly detection; Data architectures; Data framework; Hybrid architectures; Hybrid processing; Network traffic; Proposed architectures; Real time; Big data","","","","","","","Oliner, Adam J., Advances and challenges in log analysis, Communications of the ACM, 55, 2, pp. 55-61, (2012); Liao, Hungjen, Intrusion detection system: A comprehensive review, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 36, 1, pp. 16-24, (2013); Farooqi, Ashfaq Hussain, A survey of intrusion detection systems for wireless sensor networks, International Journal of Ad Hoc and Ubiquitous Computing, 9, 2, pp. 69-83, (2012); Big Data Principles and Best Practices of Scalable Realtime Data Systems, (2013); Hanbanchong, Aphichit, SARIMA based network bandwidth anomaly detection, JCSSE 2012 - 9th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, pp. 104-108, (2012); Villari, Massimo, AllJoyn Lambda: An architecture for the management of smart environments in IoT, Proceedings of 2014 International Conference on Smart Computing Workshops, SMARTCOMP Workshops 2014, pp. 9-14, (2015); Andrade, Pedro, Monitoring evolution at CERN, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 664, 5, (2015); Pena, Eduardo H.M., Anomaly detection using digital signature of network segment with adaptive ARIMA model and Paraconsistent Logic, Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications, (2014); Xhafa, Fatos, Massive processing of activity logs of a virtual campus, Proceedings - 3rd International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies, EIDWT 2012, pp. 104-110, (2012); Cheon, Jeongjin, Distributed processing of Snort alert log using Hadoop, International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 5, 3, pp. 2685-2690, (2013)","N.

As a response to the inability of organizations to process large quantities and varieties of data, in the technological market, arise the Big Data. This emerging concept defined mainly by the volume, velocity and variety has evolved greatly in part by its ability to generate value for organizations in decision making. Currently, the health care sector is one of the five sectors of activity where the potential of Big Data growth most stands out. However, the way to go is still long and in fact there are few organizations, related to health care, that are taking advantage of the true potential of Big Data. The main target of this research is to produce a real-time Big Data architecture to the INTCare system, of the Centro Hospitalar do Porto, using the main open source big data solution, the Apache Hadoop.

While designating the ongoing progress of BOLD as BOLD 0.0, the paper also identifies the trajectory of BOLD 0.0 as BOLD 1.0, BOLD 2.0 and BOLD 3.0 in terms of the complexity and management of data sets from different sources. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint and the ideas presented here are personal. Findings: The trajectory of BOLD shall witness ever-growing challenges as the nature and scope of data sets grow complicated. The paper posits that by the time BOLD would attain its maturity, there would be a need for newer technologies and data architecture platforms which are relatively affordable and available as “Open Source”, if possible. Research limitations/implications: Being exploratory in approach, this viewpoint presents a futuristic trend, which may or may not be valid. Nevertheless, there are significant practical implications for the academicians and practitioners to appreciate the likely challenges in the coming times for ensuring the sustainability of BOLD. Originality/value: While there are a number of studies on BOLD, there are no studies which seek to propose the possible trends in BOLD’s progress.

In these environments, log data is large, coming at high-speed, and have various formats, the classic case of big data problem. This makes anomaly detection very difficult due to the fact that to get good accuracy, large amount of data must be processed in real-time. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid architecture for log anomaly detection using Apache Spark for data processing and Apache Flume for data collecting. To demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed solution, we implement a SARIMA-based anomaly detection as a case study. The experimental results clearly indicated that our proposed architecture can support log processing in large-scale environment effectively. © 2016 IEEE.","Hadoop; Hybrid Processing; Largs-Scale; Log Processing; Real-Time","Computer architecture; Data handling; Signal detection; Software engineering; Anomaly detection; Data architectures; Hadoop; Hybrid architectures; Hybrid processing; Largs-Scale; Proposed architectures; Real time; Big data","","","","","","","Big Data Principles and Best Practices of Scalable Realtime Data Systems, (2013); undefined; Spark Homepage; Spark Streaming and Other Real Time Stream Processing Framework; A Hadoop Homepage; Hanbanchong, Aphichit, SARIMA based network bandwidth anomaly detection, JCSSE 2012 - 9th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, pp. 104-108, (2012); Villari, Massimo, AllJoyn Lambda: An architecture for the management of smart environments in IoT, Proceedings of 2014 International Conference on Smart Computing Workshops, SMARTCOMP Workshops 2014, pp. 9-14, (2015); Andrade, Pedro, Monitoring evolution at CERN, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 664, 5, (2015); Pena, Eduardo H.M., Anomaly detection using digital signature of network segment with adaptive ARIMA model and Paraconsistent Logic, Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications, (2014); Xhafa, Fatos, Massive processing of activity logs of a virtual campus, Proceedings - 3rd International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies, EIDWT 2012, pp. 104-110, (2012)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","13th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering, JCSSE 2016","2016-07-13 through 2016-07-15","Khon Kaen","124921","","9781509020331","","","English","Int.

The ExoMars 2016 is the first mission of the ESA’s ExoMars Programme. The mission comprises the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and the Entry, Descent and Landing demonstrator (Schiapparelli EDM) launched in March 2016. The TGO will perform the data relay of all Mars proximity communications of the ExoMars Rover mission planned to be launched in 2020, and enhance the communication network for the already present and future NASA assets on the Martian surface. Mission Control System development at ESOC follows a well proven and successful approach of reusing a baseline of infrastructure data systems that have been specialized in the course of the years in two main branches, for Science and Interplanetary missions and for Earth Observation missions. The complexity of the ExoMars 2016 mission due to required relay support of different landed assets and of different agencies resulted in the definition of a relevant number, around 30%, of mission specific requirements. This required an in depth analysis of the features offered by the infrastructure software system to evaluate their capability to support the needs of the ExoMars mission. This paper introduces the context of ESOC where the ExoMars ground segment systems are developed, and it presents the results of the requirements analysis that shows that the infrastructure data system archives used in all previous missions, based on the SCOS-2000 Mission Control System, and some of its ancillary products, could not fully support the ExoMars 2016 mission for its entire planned ten years duration. The baseline infrastructure architecture is presented and it is shown how the choice of new open source big data products helped in the fulfillment of the demanding requirements of the ExoMars 2016 mission. The new infrastructure solutions used for the first time in the ExoMars 2016 mission will be the basis for future Mission Control Systems at ESA/ESOC and pave the way to increase the number of systems that will be offered as services, based on the Big Data Architecture under development at ESOC. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This book covers the best-practice design approaches to re-architecting your relational applications and transforming your relational data to optimize concurrency, security, denormalization, and performance. Winner of IBM's 2012 Gerstner Award for his implementation of big data and data warehouse initiatives and author of Practical Hadoop Security, author Bhushan Lakhe walks you through the entire transition process. First, he lays out the criteria for deciding what blend of re-architecting, migration, and integration between RDBMS and HDFS best meets your transition objectives. Then he demonstrates how to design your transition model. Lakhe proceeds to cover the selection criteria for ETL tools, the implementation steps for migration with SQOOP- and Flume-based data transfers, and transition optimization techniques for tuning partitions, scheduling aggregations, and redesigning ETL. Finally, he assesses the pros and cons of data lakes and Lambda architecture as integrative solutions and illustrates their implementation with real-world case studies. Hadoop/NoSQL solutions do not offer by default certain relational technology features such as role-based access control, locking for concurrent updates, and various tools for measuring and enhancing performance. Practical Hadoop Migration shows how to use open-source tools to emulate such relational functionalities in Hadoop ecosystem components. What You'll Learn Decide whether you should migrate your relational applications to big data technologies or integrate them Transition your relational applications to Hadoop/NoSQL platforms in terms of logical design and physical implementation Discover RDBMS-to-HDFS integration, data transformation, and optimization techniques Consider when to use Lambda architecture and data lake solutions Select and implement Hadoop-based components and applications to speed transition, optimize integrated performance, and emulate relational functionalities Who This Book Is For Database developers, database administrators, enterprise architects, Hadoop/NoSQL developers, and IT leaders.

The paper constructs social information landscapes (SIL). Design/methodology/approach - The research presented here adopts a Big Data methodological approach for mapping user-generated contents in social media. The methodology and algorithms presented are generic, and can be applied to diverse types of social media or user-generated contents involving user interactions, such as within blogs, comments in product pages, and other forms of media, so long as a formal data structure proposed here can be constructed. Findings - The limited presentation of the sequential nature of content listings within social media and Web 2.0 pages, as viewed on web browsers or on mobile devices, do not necessarily reveal nor make obvious an unknown nature of the medium; that every participant, from content producers, to consumers, to followers and subscribers, including the contents they produce or subscribed to, are intrinsically connected in a hidden but massive network. Such networks when mapped, could be quantitatively analysed using social network analysis (e.g. centralities), and the semantics and sentiments could equally reveal valuable information with appropriate analytics. Yet that which is difficult is the traditional approach of collecting, cleaning, collating, and mapping such data sets into a sufficiently large sample of data that could yield important insights into the community structure and the directional, and polarity of interaction on diverse topics. This research solves this particular strand of problem. Research limitations/implications - The automated mapping of extremely large networks involving hundreds of thousands to millions of nodes, encapsulating high resolution and contextual information, over a long period of time could possibly assist in the proving or even disproving of theories. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of using automated approaches for acquiring massive, connected data sets for academic inquiry in the social sciences. Practical implications - The methods presented in this paper, together with the Big Data architecture can assist individuals and institutions with a limited budget, with practical approaches in constructing SIL. The software-hardware integrated architecture uses open source software, furthermore, the SIL mapping algorithms are easy to implement. Originality/value - The majority of research in the literature uses traditional approaches for collecting social networks data. Traditional approaches can be slow and tedious; they do not yield adequate sample size to be of significant value for research. Whilst traditional approaches collect only a small percentage of data, the original methods presented here are able to collect and collate entire data sets in social media due to the automated and scalable mapping techniques. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Big data; Longitudinal network; Multimodal network; Online communities; Social information landscapes; Social network analysis","Automation; Budget control; Conformal mapping; Network architecture; Open source software; Open systems; Semantics; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Web browsers; Design/methodology/approach; Integrated architecture; Methodological approach; Multimodal network; On-line communities; Social information; Traditional approaches; User-generated content; Big data","","","","","","","Wired, (2008); Eu Project to Build Lie Detector for Social Media, (2014); Bbc Technology, (2014); Bourdieu, Pierre, The social space and the genesis of groups, Theory and Society, 14, 6, pp. 723-744, (1985); A Decade in Internet Time Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society, (2011); Ch’ng, Eugene, The value of using big data technologies in computational social science, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 04-07-August-2014, (2014); Big Data and Visual Analytics Lab, (2015); Social Networking, (2015); Ch’ng, Eugene, The bottom-up formation and maintenance of a Twitter community analysis of the #FreeJahar Twitter community, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 115, 4, pp. 612-624, (2015); Gaffney, Vince L., Time and a place: A luni-solar 'time-reckoner' from 8th millennium BC Scotland, Internet Archaeology, 34, (2013)","E.

This extended abstract presents topical, multimodal, and longitudinal social media datasets from the integration of various scalable open source technologies. The full article details the process that led to the discovery of social information landscapes within the Twitter social network, highlighting the experience of dealing with social media datasets, using a funneling approach so that data becomes manageable. © Copyright 2014 ACM.","Computational social science; Data mining; Open source; Social network analysis; Twitter","Abstracting; Behavioral research; Complex networks; Data handling; Data mining; Social networking (online); Social sciences; Social sciences computing; Computational social science; Data architectures; Extended abstracts; Open sources; Open-source technology; Social media datum; Twitter; Twitter social networks; Big data","","","","","","","A Decade in Internet Time Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society, (2011); McMillan, David W., Sense of community: A definition and theory, Journal of Community Psychology, 14, 1, pp. 6-23, (1986)","E.

Experts provide a practical framework for assessing the fitness and constraints of these diverse data platform options within hybridized big-data architectures. The range of established and new data architectures and platforms continues to expand in the era of constant database innovation. A growing range of commercial and open source offerings hybridize these approaches to varying degrees, and increasing numbers of them are being implemented within various public, private, and other clouds. These architectures include file systems such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), columnar databases such as Apache Hbase, stream-computing time databases such as Apache Cassandra, other relational databases, stream-computing environments, and in-memory databases from various vendors. The same applies to the data platforms lumped under the terms NoSQL and NewSQL, which may include innovative databases in any of these categories.","","Big datum; Cassandras; Data architectures; Data platform; File systems; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); Open sources; Relational Database; Functional services; In-buildings; Optimal data; Service levels; Sharp focus; Traditional approaches; Unified architecture; File organization; Database systems","","","","","","","Informationweek Software, (2013)","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","IBM Data Manag.
