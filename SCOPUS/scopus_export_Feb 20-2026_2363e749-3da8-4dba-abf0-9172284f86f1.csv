Recent studies show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST, ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks, outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training. Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data lake-trained models and centralized federated learning. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.","Data exfiltration mitigation; Data lake security","Data privacy; Decay (organic); Federated learning; Health risks; Information leakage; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Multi-task learning; Network security; Data exfiltration; Data exfiltration mitigation; Data lake security; Fine tuning; Layer-wise; Learning rates; Machine learning models; Medical data sets; Modeling parameters; Task performance; Lakes","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS; (ANR-23-IACL-0001)","This work was supported by the R\u00E9gion PACA and France 2030 initiative through the funding of the I-D\u00E9mo project PLICIA, and by the French government through the National Research Agency (ANR), under the IA Cluster projects (ANR-23-IACL-0001).

Modern eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques focus on benchmark datasets, but the cognitive applicability of such solutions under big data settings is still unclear due to memory or computation constraints. In this paper, we extend a model-agnostic XAI methodology, named Cluster-Aided Space Transformation for Local Explanation (CASTLE), to be able to deal with high-volume datasets. CASTLE aims to explain the black-box behavior of predictive models by combining both local (i.e., based on the input sample) and global (i.e., based on the whole scope for action of the model) information. In particular, the local explanation provides a rule-based explanation for the prediction of a target instance as well as the directions to update the likelihood of the predicted class. Our extension leverages modern big data technologies (e.g., Apache Spark) to handle the high volume, variety, and velocity of huge datasets. We have evaluated the framework on five datasets, in terms of temporal efficiency, explanation quality, and model significance. Our results indicate that the proposed approach retains the high-quality explanations associated with CASTLE while efficiently handling large datasets. Importantly, it exhibits a sub-linear, rather than exponential, dependence on dataset size, making it a scalable solution for massive datasets or in any big data scenario. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Clustering; eXplainable artificial intelligence","Clustering algorithms; Large datasets; Benchmark datasets; Black boxes; Clusterings; Data architectures; Explainable artificial intelligence; Financial domains; High volumes; Medical domains; Military domains; Space transformations; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Firouzi, Farshad, The convergence and interplay of edge, fog, and cloud in the AI-driven Internet of Things (IoT), Information Systems, 107, (2022); Cao, Longbing, AI in Finance: Challenges, Techniques, and Opportunities, ACM Computing Surveys, 55, 3, (2022); Huang, Changwu, An Overview of Artificial Intelligence Ethics, IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, 4, 4, pp. 799-819, (2023); Strouse, Daniel J., Collaborating with Humans without Human Data, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 18, pp. 14502-14515, (2021); Li, Zhibin, An overview of calibration technology of industrial robots, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 8, 1, pp. 23-36, (2021); Zhou, Xuanhe, Database Meets Artificial Intelligence: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 34, 3, pp. 1096-1116, (2022); Jiao, Licheng, New Generation Deep Learning for Video Object Detection: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 33, 8, pp. 3195-3215, (2022); Li, Jing, A Survey on Deep Learning for Named Entity Recognition, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 34, 1, pp. 50-70, (2022); Li, Zhibin, A Novel Calibration System for Robot Arm via an Open Dataset and a Learning Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, 69, 12, pp. 5169-5173, (2022); Li, Zhibin, Diversified Regularization Enhanced Training for Effective Manipulator Calibration, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 34, 11, pp. 8778-8790, (2023)","G.

As digital transformation sweeps across this sector, the imperative to fortify cybersecurity defenses against ever-evolving threats has become paramount. Innovative and forward-looking oil and gas organizations across the globe are adopting the Cloud in many forms because of their digital transformation initiatives. Data lakes, edge technology, machine-to-machine communication, and machine learning (ML) algorithms have been enabling this industrial digital transformation. This transformation is also driving changes to the OT landscape, and as these environments continue to evolve, OT environments are leveraging well proven IT solution patterns to improve the productivity and efficiency of production operations. Industrial customers often start their digital transformation journey by sending OT data to the cloud for analysis and analytics without sending commands back to the industrial automation and control systems (ICAS). This process is often called ""open loop"" operations, since there is one-way communication from edge to cloud. Customers generally find this relatively easy to secure and manage. However, more often we are witnessing requirements to optimize operations by generating an automatic or operator-initiated response in the oil and gas production operation, rig management based on insights gained from cloud analytics. This process is often referred to as ""closed loop"" operations with two-way communication between edge and cloud. The security and compliance practices for closed loop operations are more rigorous because closed operations manipulate OT devices remotely. Developing these practices should be rooted in a cyber risk assessment to help businesses understand and prioritize security concerns. In this paper we propose how strengths of Cloud computing can become key enabler for oil and gas organizations in helping them enhance their overall security posture and manage risks within OT environments. We have deployed solution patterns described in this paper as the foundational pillar of several Oil and Gas organization's overall OT system architecture to unlock both ""open loop"" and ""closed loop"" operations in a secure, reliable and cost-effective manner. The specific scope items we will cover in this paper focus on a custom security uplift framework having four foundational components - 1) Cloud led architecture patterns to provide next generation network segmentation strategies in OT De-militarized Zone 2) OT asset inventory and vulnerability management 3) Centralized security monitoring and incident response with help of Artificial Intelligence and most recently providing Generative AI based virtual assistant to query security event data from OT systems. For organizations to plan their industrial digital transformation safely and securely, it is recommended that a multi-layered approach to secure the Industrial Control Systems (ICS)/OT and Cloud environments be implemented as captured in ten security golden rules in the following paper [1]. In addition to this, in the paper we propose a comprehensive architecture framework that aligns with established cybersecurity framework (CSF) such as NIST. The use case studies discussed in the paper will highlight how customer have been able to remediate critical security vulnerabilities within weeks post implementation by deploying a comprehensive asset inventory discovery and vulnerability assessment. This has help reduce mean time to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities from months to days with automated testing in pre-production environments, ensure quick detection and response towards security incidents with help of advanced security monitoring and incident response playbooks, covering 100% of the OT assets through this capability and leverage advanced data analytics, machine learning to perform log mining, data cleansing, data validation, log mining and analysis through natural language processing such as conversational AI assistants powered by large language model (LLM) in the Cloud. © 2024, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","","Asphaltenes; Bearing pads; Bolts; Coal deposits; Costs; Critical path analysis; Drug products plants; Earnings; Financial markets; Foil bearings; Gasoline; Helical springs; Hydrostatic bearings; Journal bearings; Liquefied petroleum gas; Locks (fasteners); Loss prevention; Mineral oils; Naphthas; Nonmetallic bearings; Nonmetallic gears; Oil shale; Petroleum industry; Petroleum tar; Pipelines; Piston displacement; Piston rings; Proven reserves; Resource valuation; Ring springs; Rotating disks; Screws; Speed reducers; Steam; Variable speed drives; Wire belts; Closed-loop operation; Cyber security; Digital transformation; Oil and gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Operational technologies; Production operations; Security incident; Solution patterns; Technology system; Gas industry","","","","","","","Ten Security Golden Rules for Industrial Iot Solutions; Unidirectional Network or Data Diodes; undefined; Closed Loop Control in Upstream Oil and Gas; Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture; Improve Your Security Posture with Clarity Xdome Integration with Aws Security Hub; How Amazon Security Lake is Helping Customers Simplify Security Management for Proactive Threat Analysis","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers","","2024 Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference, ADIPEC 2024","2024-11-04 through 2024-11-07","Abu Dhabi","205060","","9781959025498","","","English","Soc.

As the Department of Defense (DoD) leverages AI/ML to develop, test, and deploy autonomous vehicle capabilities, management of autonomy data will become increasingly important. Modern sensors on autonomous vehicles generate an enormous amount of data, and making this data available for further research presents a significant challenge. Moving such large volumes of data from a field environment to a centralized, cloud-based data lake is not straightforward, nor necessarily efficient for data of unknown enterprise utility. As a result, much of DoD’s autonomy data remains siloed in geographically or logically separated on-premises and cloud-based data stores in mixed formats. Organizations within DoD’s modernization enterprise require a mature data infrastructure to store, discover, share, and collaborate upon datasets, models, and other artifacts efficiently. In this paper, we examine the characteristics a data infrastructure must exhibit to meet the needs of the DoD for autonomy research. These characteristics are identified through a review of existing solutions, use cases, and current industry best practices. On the basis of this review, we propose a set of requirements for DoD’s data infrastructure for autonomous systems research.

With enormous amounts of information originating in sources with uncertain degree of validation and accuracy, it is essential to provide executive-level decision-makers with the most actionable, pertinent, and updated data analysis to enable them to adapt their strategy swiftly and competently. Objective: We report here the origination of a COVID-19 dedicated response in the Israel Defense Forces with the assembly of an operational Data Center for the Campaign against Coronavirus. Methods: Spearheaded by directors with clinical, operational, and data analytics orientation, a multidisciplinary team utilized existing and newly developed platforms to collect and analyze large amounts of information on an individual level in the context of SARS-CoV-2 contraction and infection. Results: Nearly 300,000 responses to daily questionnaires were recorded and were merged with other data sets to form a unified data lake. By using basic as well as advanced analytic tools ranging from simple aggregation and display of trends to data science application, we provided commanders and clinicians with access to trusted, accurate, and personalized information and tools that were designed to foster operational changes and mitigate the propagation of the pandemic. The developed tools aided in the in the identification of high-risk individuals for severe disease and resulted in a 30% decline in their attendance to their units. Moreover, the queue for laboratory examination for COVID-19 was optimized using a predictive model and resulted in a high true-positive rate of 20%, which is more than twice as high as the baseline rate (2.28%, 95% CI 1.63%-3.19%).Conclusions: In times of ambiguity and uncertainty, along with an unprecedented flux of information, health organizations may find multidisciplinary teams working to provide intelligence from diverse and rich data a key factor in providing executives relevant and actionable support for decision-making. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The research followed an interpretive epistemology conducted as seven case studies across mining, utility and defence based organisations, a Delphi survey with over fifty Technology and Engineering practitioners to confirm baseline TOP constructs and subsequent application of open, federated data architecture in Australian water and defence industries. The research findings and industry application suggests a cost effective, benefits realization, vendor agnostic way to connect and automate often soiled important data types for reuse and first level automated decision making, improving data quality, integrity, asset reliability and organizational trust in data and automation initiatives. Digital transformation and safety goals can be achieved by people becoming second point decision makers, informed by the automated aggregated data across the organization, providing a valuable extension to the reliance on traditional machine learning and business analytics involving data warehouses and business system data to the exclusion of asset performance.

The GCCS accommodates all mission and operational scenarios by allowing users access to C41 resources worldwide through the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) at any time and any place. The GCCS integrates emerging information systems and elements of the DII in a three-tier client-server distributed computing environment. The GCCS architecture will be designed to satisfy C41 functional requirements and conform to the Technical Reference Model (TRM). The GCCS Technical Architecture will evolve over time, allowing for the incorporation of technological advances.","","Computer architecture; Decision support systems; Information services; Military operations; Robustness (control systems); Standardization; Strategic planning; Data architectures; Defense information infrastructure; Global command and control system; Technical reference model; Command and control systems","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE MILCOM.
