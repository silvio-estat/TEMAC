The input events correspond to traffic measurements, water levels, water flows, water predictions and flow predictions made available by French official services. The main contributions of this study are: (i) the connection between a complex event processing engine and a graph database containing the model of the crisis situation and (ii) the continuous updating of a common operational picture for the benefit of emergency managers.

The paper gives an insight of the battlefield with the perspective of an infantry soldier; enumerates the ability of technology to empower him; and effectively equip him to handle battle pressures using information available to improve his battlefield survivability. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, within the scope of the concepts of Battlefield of Things (BoTs) the paper enumerates parameters of significant importance for a soldier, which would be realised using Body Area Networks (BANs). Second, the study states the critical need to understand the nature of data along with its flow, interpretation, collection, aggregation, dissemination analysis to enrich the fighting arms. Third, a network model is proposed to represent the implications of deployment of BAN for effective decision making. The paper concludes with the fact that the utility of BANs and data analysis has the potential to enhance a soldier's life expectancy in the battlefield of modern times. © 2018 IEEE.","Battlefield management; Battlefield-of-Things; Big data analysis; sensors; wireless networks","Data handling; Decision making; Information analysis; Sensors; Wireless networks; Battlefield environments; Battlefield management; Battlefield-of-Things; Body Area Network; Infantry soldiers; Life expectancies; Network modeling; Sensor technologies; Big data","","","","","","","Strategy for an Army Center for Network Science, Technology, and Experimentation, Strategy for an Army Center for Network Science, Technology, and Experimentation, pp. 1-79, (2007); Varghese, Vincent, Battlefield-of-Things and its Implications in Modern Day Battlefield, 2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research, ICCIC 2017, (2018); Hämäläinen, Matti, Recent Advances in Body Area Network Technology and Applications, International Journal of Wireless Information Networks, 24, 2, pp. 63-64, (2017); Kompara, Marko, Survey on security in intra-body area network communication, Ad Hoc Networks, 70, pp. 23-43, (2018); Abidi, Bahae, Wireless sensor networks in biomedical: Wireless body area networks, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 520, pp. 321-329, (2017); Goss, Cynthia W., Rural American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans' telemental health: A model of culturally centered care, Psychological Services, 14, 3, pp. 270-278, (2017); Information Requirements for Battlefield Management System N Survey and Prototype Evaluation, (1986); Fundamentals of Wireless Sensor Networks Theory and Practice, (2010); Big Data Fundamentals Concepts Drivers Techniques, (2016); Roy, Sudipto, A security framework for military application on infrastructure based wireless sensor network, Proceedings of 2015 IEEE International Conference on Research in Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks, ICRCICN 2015, pp. 369-376, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","C-DAC; Diyala University; JSPMS/TSSMS PVPIT; Siddhant College of Engineering","3rd International Conference for Convergence in Technology, I2CT 2018","2018-04-06 through 2018-04-08","Pune","142354","","9781538642733","","","English","Int.

To succeed, the GéNéPi system needs to be aware of the ongoing crisis developments. For now, its best chance is to benefit from the ever growing number of available data sources. One of its goals is, therefore, to learn how to manage numerous, heterogeneous, more or less reliable data, in order to interpret them, in time, for the officials.

Public Safety Organisations like the police, rescue and emergency services, as well as emergency response centres require a reliable and up-to-date situation picture at all times. In the event of demanding multiauthority operations, like crises, multi-casualty incidents, and emergencies, the role of Public Safety Organisations' 24/7 situation centres becomes vital. Typically, the different authorities have their own situation centres, which cooperate by using different technological solutions like a multi-authority radio network and real-time video connections. The use of new technology, information systems, UAVs, and body cameras facilitates receiving and processing information to build a more accurate situation picture. However, all the technology may cause moments of information overload. Furthermore, the increasing role of citizens in producing valuable information for Public Safety Organisations via social media, for instance, should not be overlooked. The role of information management is crucial in forming situational awareness and a common operational picture, especially in time-critical and rapidly evolving multi-authority missions. The literature related to Public Safety Organisations' situation centres is scarce, especially when explored from the information flow and situation picture point of view. In this paper, we explore the current technologies, practices, and action models in use to ensure adequate information-sharing between Public Safety Organisations to enable a common operational picture and collaborative decision-making in hybrid environments. The empirical data were collected through interviews with staff at different Public Safety Organisations and analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results suggest that the critical factors in ensuring information flow and thus the situation picture are communication tools, access to all the necessary channels and groups, common operational picture systems to enable shared situational awareness, and jointly approved cooperation plans combined with regular training and drills. In addition, human factors play an important role in complex, multi-authority missions. The possibility to deliver pictures and live video from the scene was highlighted and the data security issues related to it were mentioned as a challenge. It can also be concluded that in the near future the authorities need to develop tools and processes for utilising big data produced by citizens in social media.","Common operational picture; Information flow; Multi-authority cooperation; Situation centre; Situation picture","Big data; Decision making; Information management; Information use; Social networking (online); 'current; Common operational picture; Information flows; Multi authorities; Multi-authority cooperation; Public safety; Safety organizations; Situation centers; Situation picture; Social media; Emergency services","","","","","","","Bolle, Stein Roald, Video calls from lay bystanders to dispatch centers - Risk assessment of information security, BMC Health Services Research, 11, (2011); Icons 2016 the 11th International Conference on Systems, (2016); Content Analysis an Introduction to Its Methodology, (1980); Management of Major Accidents Communication Challenges and Solutions in the Preparedness and Response Phases for both Authorities and Companies, (2014); Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, (2004); McNeese, Michael D., Multiple vantage points of the common operational picture: Supporting international teamwork, Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, pp. 467-471, (2006); Melbye, Sigurd Arne, Mobile videoconferencing for enhanced emergency medical communication - a shot in the dark or a walk in the park? -- A simulation study, Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine, 22, 1, (2014); Ojasalo, Jukka, Responsibility and decision making transfer in public safety and security emergencies-A case study of school shootings, 2009 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security, HST 2009, pp. 358-365, (2009); Preden, Jürgo Sören, Data exchange for shared situation awareness, 2012 IEEE International Multi-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support, CogSIMA 2012, pp. 198-201, (2012); Stange, Hendrik, Insight-driven crisis information-preparing for the unexpected using big data, ISCRAM 2015 Conference Proceedings - 12th International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, 2015-January, (2015)","","Scanlon, M.; Le-Khac, N.-A.","Curran Associates Inc.","","16th European Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ECCWS 2017","2017-06-29 through 2017-06-30","Dublin","129462","20488602","9781912764617; 9781914587405; 9781627489089; 9781910810286; 9781912764280; 9781914587702; 9781910309247; 9781911218852; 9781910810934; 9781911218432","","","English","European Conf.
