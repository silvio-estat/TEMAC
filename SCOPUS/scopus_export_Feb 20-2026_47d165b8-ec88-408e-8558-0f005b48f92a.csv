Traditional approaches often fail to integrate heterogeneous data, limiting predictive and decision-support capabilities. This study presents a conceptual architecture for an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted Digital Twin (DT) of the Centre-Val de Loire region, designed to unify time-dependent multi-source data. Based on the ENVRI Reference Model, it covers Science, Information, Computational, Engineering, and Technology layers, defining standardized data exchange, communication protocols, and prototype functionalities. A proof of concept FIWARE implementation supports ingestion, monitoring and analytical services for piezometric and meteorological data, exemplified through groundwater dynamics in the Beauce aquifer. It integrates daily observations from 53 piezometric stations over more than five years, managing approximately 2.8 million records in a containerized environment. Results show that the proposed DT architecture can enhance sustainability-oriented decision making, integrating heterogeneous data and predictive analyses while enabling collaboration across scientific and technical domains. Its modular design offers a replicable template for future AI-assisted environmental DTs, scalable to larger regions. Hence, this work illustrates how DTs can improve environmental monitoring and understanding, providing a pathway toward resilient, data-driven management of natural resources. © 2026 The Authors.","Artificial intelligence; Data architecture; Digital twins; Environmental monitoring; Natural resource management","artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; data management; decision making; environmental monitoring; resource management; Beauce [Centre]; Centre-Val de Loire; France","","","","","Conseil Régional du Centre-Val de Loire","Funding text 1: This work has received support under the JUNON Program, with the financial support of the R\u00E9gion Centre-Val de Loire (France) .; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge TU Wien Bibliothek, Austria for financial support through its Open Access Funding Programme.

This book introduces a practical framework for building AI-powered agent swarms that operate across six critical dimensions of business dark data, empowering intelligent automation, decision augmentation, and strategic foresight at unprecedented scale. In an age when data is underutilized, organizations are overwhelmed by complexity, latency, and fragmentation. Traditional analytics pipelines fall short in handling dynamic environments and human-centric demands. This book addresses this critical gap by detailing how autonomous Gen-AI agents — built on foundational disciplines of data engineering, data science, and machine learning — can process, personalize, and operationalize hidden insights buried deep within enterprise systems. The six dimensions presented in the book form a cognitive and computational blueprint that guides the design, deployment, and evolution of agentic swarms. Each dimension focuses on a specific mode of intelligence — such as contextual reasoning, emotional alignment, or real-time adaptive sensing — and shows how AI agents can specialize within each domain to maximize business impact. Readers won’t just learn theory — they’ll explore field-tested methodologies to deploy Gen-AI-powered solutions at enterprise scale. From zoned data lakes and transformer models to swarm governance and consensus mechanisms, the book walks readers through the full life cycle of building intelligent systems that learn, evolve, and act with purpose. What makes this book essential — and unlike others in the market — is that the author is not writing from the sidelines. He is actively architecting and delivering these systems today, with firsthand insight into what works, what fails, and what the future holds. The methodology presented blends system design, human-aligned AI, industrial automation, and trusted decision-making, offering readers a rich and practical road map for AI-first enterprise innovation. What You Will Learn: How to structure AI-powered agents across six interlinked cognitive and computational dimensions to effectively process dark data and deliver hyper-personalized, real-time business insights. Practical knowledge on how to orchestrate swarms of Gen-AI agents — governed by Councils — that collaboratively manage complexity, detect emerging patterns, and operate autonomously in enterprise environments. The foundational and advanced skills required to implement generative AI and agent-based intelligence within large-scale, multi-cloud, and hybrid business ecosystems. Who This Book is For: This book is designed for professionals and practitioners operating at the intersection of artificial intelligence and business transformation. It is ideal for AI developers, data scientists, solution architects, enterprise engineers, and technical managers who are looking to move beyond the hype of generative AI and apply it meaningfully within industrial and enterprise-grade ecosystems. © Andreas François Vermeulen 2026.","","Agents; Automation; Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Decision making; Intelligent agents; Life cycle; Swarm intelligence; Agent swarm; Critical dimension; Dynamic environments; Enterprise data; Foundational discipline; Handling dynamics; Human-centric; Intelligent automation; Learn+; Strategic foresight; Autonomous agents","","","","","","","","","","Apress Media LLC","","","","","","","9798868818776; 9798868818769","","","English","Agentic Hyper-Personalized Dimensions: Six Dimensions of Bus.

With more than 90% of global trade is transported by the sea, the oceanic space serves as the backbone of globalization, facilitating the uninterrupted movement of goods, energy, and real-time data. Furthermore, critical maritime infrastructure such as the submarine cables transmits over 95% of global internet traffic and underpins the data architecture utilized by AI systems. The chapter examines how AI-based maritime security can strengthen existing global trade routes and secure critical maritime infrastructure amidst trade wars, cyber threats, and escalating great power competition. It gives an overview of the use of AI in powering cutting-edge maritime technologies, such as autonomous surface and subsurface vessels, predictive analytics for port congestion, machine-learning based anomaly detection, improved situational awareness and supporting informed decision-making for maritime operations. These AI functions, while securing against threats, can bring new risks in the form of data privacy, electronic spoofing and cyber-attacks. This chapter draws insights from a qualitative review of literature, including institutional publications by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Maritime Law Institute (IMLI), as well as conversations with maritime practitioners, supply-chain leaders, and policymakers. It discusses the ways in which the convergence of AI in the maritime sector changes power dynamics, arguing that the future strategic balance of power at sea will require the integration of AI technologies with strong legal frameworks and multilateral partnerships.

The clinical management of major depressive disorder is constrained by a trial-and-error approach. While computational methods have focused on static binary classification (e.g., responder vs. non-responder), they ignore the dynamic nature of recovery. Building upon the recently proposed prognostic theory of treatment response, this article presents a methodological framework for its operationalisation. We define a multi-modal data architecture for the theory’s core constructs—the Patient State Vector (PSV), Therapeutic Impulse Function (TIF), and Predicted Recovery Trajectory (PRT)—transforming them from abstract concepts into specified computational inputs. To model the asynchronous interactions between these components, we specify a Time-Aware Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, providing explicit mathematical formulations for time-decay gates to handle irregular clinical sampling. Furthermore, we outline a synthetic validation protocol to benchmark this dynamic approach against static baselines. By integrating these technical specifications with a translational pipeline for Explainable AI (XAI) and ethical governance, this paper provides the necessary blueprint to transition psychiatry from theoretical prognosis to empirical forecasting. © 2026 by the authors.","clinical decision support; computational psychiatry; deep learning; digital phenotyping; Explainable AI (XAI); major depressive disorder (MDD); personalised psychiatry; prognosis; time-series forecasting; treatment response prediction","Abstracting; Computation theory; Computer aided diagnosis; Dynamics; Ethical aspects; Forecasting; Memory architecture; Modal analysis; Recovery; Clinical decision support; Computational psychiatry; Deep learning; Digital phenotyping; Explainable AI (XAI); Major depressive disorder; Personalized psychiatry; Phenotyping; Prognose; Response prediction; Time series forecasting; Treatment response; Treatment response prediction; biological marker; cytochrome P450 2C19; cytochrome P450 2D6; anxiety disorder; Article; circadian rhythm; cognitive behavioral therapy; comorbidity; computer analysis; dynamics; electronic health record; entropy; explainable artificial intelligence; forecasting; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; genetic polymorphism; gyroscope sensor; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; long short term memory network; machine learning; major depression; management; mental health; mental health recovery; metabolism; natural language processing; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; patient state vector; patient-reported outcome; phenotype; physical activity; predicted recovery trajectory; prognosis; psychiatry; psychodynamic psychotherapy; psychotherapy; recurrent neural network; short term memory; sleep time; social behavior; therapeutic impulse function; treatment response","","","","","","","Abrahams, Abigail B., Exploring the incidence of inadequate response to antidepressants in the primary care of depression, European Neuropsychopharmacology, 83, pp. 61-70, (2024); Penn, Elizabeth, The drugs don't work? antidepressants and the current and future pharmacological management of depression, Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology, 2, 5, pp. 179-188, (2012); Al-Harbi, Khalid Saad, Treatment-resistant depression: Therapeutic trends, challenges, and future directions, Patient Preference and Adherence, 6, pp. 369-388, (2012); Zelek- Molik, Agnieszka, Trends in research on novel antidepressant treatments, Frontiers in Pharmacology, 16, (2025); Voineskos, Daphne, Management of treatment-resistant depression: Challenges and strategies, Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, 16, pp. 221-234, (2020); Rush, Augustus John, Acute and longer-term outcomes in depressed outpatients requiring one or several treatment steps: A STAR*D report, American Journal of Psychiatry, 163, 11, pp. 1905-1917, (2006); Crown, William H., The impact of treatment-resistant depression on health care utilization and costs, Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 63, 11, pp. 963-971, (2002); Lépine, Jean Pierre, The increasing burden of depression, Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, 7, SUPPL., pp. 3-7, (2011); Ozomaro, Uzoezi, Personalized medicine in psychiatry: Problems and promises, BMC Medicine, 11, 1, (2013); Baminiwatta, Anuradha K.A.B., Global trends of machine learning applications in psychiatric research over 30 years: A bibliometric analysis, Asian Journal of Psychiatry, 69, (2022)","L.

Recent advances in qualitative temporal reasoning have developed a set of 74 relations that apply between discretized time intervals of at least two pixels each. While the identification of specific relations is important, the field of qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning relies on conceptual neighborhood graphs to address relational similarity. This similarity is paramount for generating essential decision support structures, notably reasonable aggregations of concepts into single terms and the determination of nearest neighbor queries. In this paper, conceptual neighborhood graphs of qualitative topological changes, with discretized temporal interval relations in the form of translation, isotropic scaling, and anisotropic scaling, are identified using data generated through a simulation protocol. The outputs of this protocol are compared to the extant literature regarding conceptual neighborhood graphs of the Allen interval algebra, demonstrating the theoretical accuracy of the work. This work supports the development of robust spatio-temporal artificial intelligence as well as the future development of spatio-temporal query systems upon the spatio-temporal stack data architecture. © 2026 by the authors.","conceptual neighborhood graph; qualitative reasoning; rasters; spatio-temporal stack; temporal reasoning; time geography; topological relations","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2019740, 2218063); National Science Foundation, NSF","Matthew P.

Incorporating structured claims data and unstructured content from electronic medical records (EMRs) enables our system to outperform traditional single-modality systems and commercial solutions with 89.4% accuracy, 88.7% precision, and 94.7% AUC-ROC in predictive performance versus the other system’s 83.6% accuracy and 82.9% precision. We employ a hybrid architecture that integrates gradient boosting approaches for tabular claims data with transformer-based natural language processing for clinical narratives. The system used exhibits extraordinary operational efficiency gains in terms of preauthorization decision time reduction by 73% from 4.2 days to 1.1 days, 42% reduction in administrative costs from $743 to $431 per case, and sustaining 89.4% agreement with expert clinical adjudication. This thorough evaluation using a multi-institutional dataset from five healthcare systems, consisting of 157,346 participants, demonstrates that the proposed pipeline is capable of effective generalization across varying patient populations and clinical scenarios. Key contributions include: A novel hybrid architecture that fuses structured claims and unstructured EMR data; A cross-system analysis in five disparate healthcare systems; Two new metrics—alignment score for the automation of preauthorization decisions against guideline-driven care automation frameworks, and clinical context alignment score for automated preauthorization decisions relative to evidence-based guidelines—to gauge the level of automation versus guideline integration; and Operational enhancement of workflow preauthorization demonstrated by reduced time and cost. This research demonstrates the operational efficiency and clinical appropriateness of using a payor-driven hybrid data architecture which combines unabridged unmanaged clinical data and structured claims data while dynamically adjusting administrative controls to clinical access frameworks within a scalable model for healthcare payors and providers. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.","Clinical Decision Support; Healthcare Informatics; Insurance Preauthorization; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Predictive Modeling","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Behavioral research; Clinical research; Computer architecture; Data accuracy; Data reduction; Decision support systems; Health care; Health insurance; Learning systems; Medical computing; Medical informatics; Predictive analytics; Clinical decision support; Health care informatics; Healthcare systems; Insurance preauthorization; Language processing; Machine-learning; Medical record; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Predictive models; Efficiency","","","","","","","AMA Prior Authorization Physician Survey, (2023); Health Aff, (2022); 2022 Caqh Index Electronic Transaction Adoption and Savings, (2023); J Am Med Inform Assoc, (2021); Health Informatics J, (2021); JAMA Intern Med, (2021); JAMA Intern Med, (2022); American Medical Association Prior Authorization and Utilization Management Reform Principles, (2023); Acad Radiol, (2022); J Manag Care Spec Pharm, (2022)","J.P.

This study aims to demonstrate the potential of sequence-by-sequence algorithms in recommending personalized medication combinations for patients with PD based on their previous visits. Our proposed method employs a gated recurrent unit model to predict accurate combinations of critical medication types for PD based on each patient’s motor symptoms and prescribed medication from previous visits. We built a multi-label model with gated recurrent units on two data architectures: (1) personalized input using each patient’s previous visits as a sample and (2) non-personalized input treating each visit as an independent sample. The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that the personalized architecture model outperforms the non-personalized model in accuracy (0.92), precision (0.94), recall (0.94), F1-score (0.94), Hamming loss (0.03), and macro average area under the receiver operating characteristic (0.94). To interpret the model’s predictions, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, which provide insights into the importance of variables both globally (across the entire model) and at the individual patient level. The results contribute to the sequential-based decision support system potentially enhancing the remote management of PD pharmacologic issues. © The Author(s) 2025.","Decision support systems; Explainable artificial intelligence; Personalized decisions; Pharmacological decisions; Sequential learning","antiparkinson agent; aged; algorithm; drug therapy; female; human; male; middle aged; Parkinson disease; personalized medicine; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; Aged; Algorithms; Antiparkinson Agents; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Precision Medicine; ROC Curve","","Antiparkinson Agents","","","","","Armstrong, Melissa Jo, Diagnosis and Treatment of Parkinson Disease: A Review, JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association, 323, 6, pp. 548-560, (2020); Marras, Connie L., Environment, lifestyle, and Parkinson's disease: Implications for prevention in the next decade, Movement Disorders, 34, 6, pp. 801-811, (2019); Picillo, Marina, The relevance of gender in Parkinson’s disease: a review, Journal of Neurology, 264, 8, pp. 1583-1607, (2017); Sveinbjörnsdóttir, Sigurlaug, The clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease, Journal of Neurochemistry, pp. 318-324, (2016); Kalia, Lorraine V., Parkinson's disease, The Lancet, 386, 9996, pp. 896-912, (2015); Tosserams, Anouk, Multidisciplinary Care to Optimize Functional Mobility in Parkinson Disease, Clinics in Geriatric Medicine, 36, 1, pp. 159-172, (2020); Grosset, Donald G., Diagnosis and pharmacological management of Parkinson's disease: Summary of SIGN guidelines, BMJ (Online), 340, 7739, (2010); Öertel, Wolfgang Hermann, Current and experimental treatments of Parkinson disease: A guide for neuroscientists, Journal of Neurochemistry, pp. 325-337, (2016); Olanow, Charles Warren, An algorithm (decision tree) for the management of Parkinson's disease (2001): Treatment guidelines, Neurology, 56, 11 SUPPL. 5, pp. S1-S88, (2001); Operations Research and Health Care, (2004)","M.

This paper describes the AI–Big Data Analytics Architecture based on a data lake architecture that uses a reduced and customized set of Hadoop and Spark as a cost-effective, on-premises alternative for advanced data analytics in power systems. As a case study, a comparative analysis of electricity price forecasting models in the day-ahead market for nodes of the Mexican national electrical system using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models, is presented. To build and select the best forecasting model, a data science and machine learning methodology is used. The results show that the Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression models presented the best performance, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) between 1% and 4% for five-day-ahead electricity price forecasting. The implementation of the best forecasting model into the Big Data Analytics Platform allows the automation of the calculation of the local electricity price forecast per node (every 24, 72, or 120 h) and its display in a comparative dashboard with actual and forecasted data for decision-making on demand. The proposed architecture is a valuable tool that allows the future implementation of intelligent energy forecasting models in power grids, such as load demand, fuel prices, power generation, and consumption, among others. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; big data analytics; big data architecture; data lake; electricity price; energy forecasting; machine learning; power systems","Advanced Analytics; Architecture; Big data; Computer architecture; Consumer behavior; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Data Analytics; Data reduction; Decision making; Deep learning; Electric load forecasting; Energy policy; Power markets; Big data analytic; Big data architecture; Data analytics; Data architectures; Data lake; Electricity prices; Energy forecasting; Machine-learning; Power; Power system; Learning systems","","","","","","","Liao, Huilian, Review of Big Data Analytics for Smart Electrical Energy Systems, Energies, 16, 8, (2023); Int J Comb Optim Probl Inform, (2024); Wang, Yi, Review of Smart Meter Data Analytics: Applications, Methodologies, and Challenges, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 10, 3, pp. 3125-3148, (2019); Zhou, Kaile, Big data driven smart energy management: From big data to big insights, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 56, pp. 215-225, (2016); Jiang, Hui, Energy big data: A survey, IEEE Access, 4, pp. 3844-3861, (2016); Guerrero-Prado, Jenniffer Sidney, The power of big data and data analytics for AMI data: A case study, Sensors (Switzerland), 20, 11, pp. 1-27, (2020); Zhang, Yang, Big data analytics in smart grids: a review, Energy Informatics, 1, 1, (2018); Kezunovic, Mladen, Big data analytics for future electricity grids, Electric Power Systems Research, 189, (2020); Syed, Dabeeruddin, Smart Grid Big Data Analytics: Survey of Technologies, Techniques, and Applications, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 59564-59585, (2021); Escobedo, Guillermo, Big data & analytics to support the renewable energy integration of smart grids case study: Power solar generation, IoTBDS 2017 - Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security, pp. 267-275, (2017)","G.

Managing this data is critical for mitigating disruptive and costly events such as mechanical failures and flight delays. This paper presents a comprehensive application of predictive analytics and machine learning to enhance aviation safety and operational efficiency. We address two core challenges: predictive maintenance of aircraft engines and forecasting flight delays. For maintenance, we utilise NASA’s C-MAPSS simulation dataset to develop and compare models, including one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), for classifying engine health status and predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), achieving classification accuracy up to 97%. For operational efficiency, we analyse historical flight data to build regression models for predicting departure delays, identifying key contributing factors such as airline, origin airport, and scheduled time. Our methodology highlights the critical role of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature selection, and data preprocessing in managing high-volume, heterogeneous data sources. The results demonstrate the significant potential of integrating these predictive models into aviation Business Intelligence (BI) systems to transition from reactive to proactive decision-making.

Data Lakehouse has emerged as a solution for nowadays data workload needs. It's a paradigm that combines the benefits of data lakes and data warehouses and provides a unified platform for a variety of operational workloads, including business intelligence, analytics, data science, and AI. In this paper, we present the concept of space filling curves, particularly the three most known curves, namely: Z-order, Hilbert, and Gray code curves. We investigate how they improve both data locality and access patterns in the context of spatial big data in Data Lakehouse. This improvement has a direct impact on storage optimization and query performance. As a practical use case, the paper covers the implementation of the Z-order curve, along with a discussion of the main algorithm's components and how it fits into the current Data Lakehouse system. We show that these optimizations significantly enhance the capabilities of Data Lakehouse architectures, ensuring better resource utilization across various spatial workloads. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Data architecture; Data LakeHouse; Query performance; Space Filling Curves; Spatial data; Storage optimization","Architecture; Big data; Computer architecture; Data handling; Decision making; Digital storage; Optimization; Query processing; Data architectures; Data driven decision; Data lakehouse; Data processing architecture; Decisions makings; Query performance; Rapid growth; Space-filling curve; Spatial data; Storage optimization; Curve fitting; Lakes; artificial intelligence; data management; data processing; optimization; performance assessment; spatial data; storage","","","","","","","Ait Errami, Soukaina, Spatial big data architecture: From Data Warehouses and Data Lakes to the LakeHouse, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 176, pp. 70-79, (2023); Aws Documentation; The Asf; Armbrust, Michael, Delta Lake: High-Performance ACID Table Storage over Cloud Object Stores, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 13, 12, pp. 3411-3424, (2020); undefined; Delta Lake Documenation; Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing, (2011); Eldawy, Ahmed, Spatial partitioning techniques in spatialhadoop, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 8, 12 12, pp. 1602-1605, (2015); Gaede, Volker J., Multidimensional Access Methods, ACM Computing Surveys, 30, 2, pp. 170-231, (1998); Guttman, Antonin, R-trees: A dynamic index structure for spatial searching, ACM SIGMOD Record, 14, 2, pp. 47-57, (1984)","S.

However, these repositories often suffer from issues such as incomplete, inconsistent, and low-quality data, which hinder data-driven insights. Existing methods for data imputation, including statistical techniques and machine learning approaches, often rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data and domain-specific knowledge, making them labor-intensive and limited in handling semantic heterogeneity across data formats. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for data imputation that effectively combines the strengths of retrieval mechanisms and large language models (LLMs). This approach constructs semantic-based indexes for heterogeneous data, employs a recall and re-ranking strategy to enhance retrieval relevance, and proposes a method to reduce inference cost while ensuring imputation quality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms machine learning and deep learning approaches. © 2025 by the authors.","data imputation; data mining; retrieval-augmented generation","Data handling; Deep learning; Digital storage; Information retrieval; Labeled data; Learning systems; Semantics; Centralised; Data driven; Data imputation; Decisions makings; Large amounts; Low qualities; Machine learning approaches; Quality data; Retrieval-augmented generation; Statistical techniques; Data mining","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKPs, (2024YFE0209000); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKPs; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (U23B2019); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC","Xiaojun SHI is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2024YFE0209000), the NSFC (Grant No. U23B2019).","Blazquez, Desamparados, Big Data sources and methods for social and economic analyses, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 130, pp. 99-113, (2018); Can, Umit, Big social network data and sustainable economic development, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 11, (2017); Arora, Anudeep, Data-Driven Decision Support Systems in E-Governance: Leveraging AI for Policymaking, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 844, pp. 229-243, (2024); Linkov, Igor I., Governance strategies for a sustainable digital world, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 2, (2018); van Veenstra, Anne Fleur, Data-driven policy making: The policy lab approach, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 10429 LNCS, pp. 100-111, (2017); Rendle, Steffen, Factorization machines, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, pp. 995-1000, (2010); He, Xiangnan, Neural factorization machines for sparse predictive analytics, SIGIR 2017 - Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 355-364, (2017); Arxiv, (2023); Wang, Liping, Stage-Aware Hierarchical Attentive Relational Network for Diagnosis Prediction, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 36, 4, pp. 1773-1784, (2024); Ye, Muchao, MedPath: Augmenting health risk prediction via medical knowledge paths, The Web Conference 2021 - Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2021, pp. 1397-1409, (2021)","L.

DTs are often composed by several interconnected models, which need to be specifically tailored to fit the DT purposes. The objective of this work is the development of an urban digital twin (UDT) for the city of Matera, following urban intelligence (UI) paradigm. The latter leverages the multi-disciplinary integration and optimization of the city systems and subsystems to develop purpose-driven DTs and support the decision-making process. The UDT is intended to support governance, stakeholders, and citizens, integrating morphological data for the city representation, reliable simulation tools and data-driven methods for the city state prediction (e.g., traffic, solar irradiation), optimization algorithms for planning and emergency response, sensors for vehicle and pedestrian traffic volumes and environmental monitoring (e.g., pollutant distributions), and a participatory data collection process from the citizens. A Data Lake is used to make available to the UDT modules the data produced by the morphological representation, simulations/data-driven methods, sensors, and the participatory data. The Data Lake provides a standardized approach for the aggregation and extraction of information. Finally, an Urban Sensing Engine supports the decision-making process with artificial intelligence forms of reasoning, to effectively combine the information produced by the UDT components. © The Author(s) 2025.","3D semantic modelling; Digital twin; Optimization; Urban intelligence","Pedestrian safety; 3d semantic modeling; Case-studies; Data-driven methods; Decision-making process; Digital representations; Interconnected models; Optimisations; Physical systems; Semantic modelling; Urban intelligence; Lake pollution","","","","","Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, CNR; (CUP I14E20000020001)","Funding text 1: Open access funding provided by Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche (CNR) within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.; Funding text 2: This work is supported by the project \u201CHouse of emerging technologies of Matera\u201D (CTEMT) funded by the Ministry of Economic Development of Italy, CUP I14E20000020001.","Kirimtat, Ayca, Future Trends and Current State of Smart City Concepts: A Survey, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 86448-86467, (2020); Glaessgen, Edwards H., The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and U.S. air force vehicles, 53rd AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference 2012, (2012); Digital Twin Manufacturing Excellence Through Virtual Factory Replication, (2014); Schleich, Benjamin, Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology, 66, 1, pp. 141-144, (2017); Ketzler, Bernd, Digital Twins for Cities: A State of the Art Review, Built Environment, 46, 4, pp. 547-573, (2020); Nochta, Timea, A Socio-Technical Perspective on Urban Analytics: The Case of City-Scale Digital Twins, Journal of Urban Technology, 28, 1-2, pp. 263-287, (2021); Gemini Principles, (2018); undefined; Khan, Md Sameeruddin, Centralized and Reliable Digital Twin Models for Smart City's Buildings Protection during Disaster, Proceedings - 2022 International Conference on Computational Modelling, Simulation and Optimization, ICCMSO 2022, pp. 226-229, (2022); White, Gary, A digital twin smart city for citizen feedback, Cities, 110, (2021)","R.

However, a modern data platform that is portable, resilient, and efficient is required to manage organisations’ data and support their growth. Furthermore, the change in the data management architectures has been accompanied by changes in storage formats, particularly open standard formats like Apache Hudi, Apache Iceberg, and Delta Lake. With many alternatives, organisations are unclear on how to combine these into an effective platform. Our work investigates capabilities provided by Kubernetes and other Cloud-Native software, using DataOps methodologies to build a generic data platform that follows the Data Lakehouse architecture. We define the data platform specification, architecture, and core components to build a proof of concept system. Moreover, we provide a clear implementation methodology by developing the core of the proposed platform, which are infrastructure (Kubernetes), ingestion and transport (Argo Workflows), storage (MinIO), and finally, query and processing (Dremio). We then conducted performance benchmarks using an industry-standard benchmark suite to compare cold/warm start scenarios and assess Dremio’s caching capabilities, demonstrating a 12% median enhancement of query duration with caching. © The Author(s) 2025.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Cloud-Native; Data Lakehouse; DataOps; Kubernetes","Big data; Information management; Sea ice; Storage management; Cloud-native; Competitive edges; Data driven decision; Data lakehouse; Data management architecture; Data platform; Dataops; Decisions makings; Kubernetes; Storage formats; Decision making","","","","","","","Armbrust, Michael, Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics, 11th Annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, CIDR 2021, (2021); Barata, Melyssa, An overview of decision support benchmarks: TPC-DS, TPC-H and SSB, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 353, pp. 619-628, (2015); Barron-Lugo, Juan Armando, Xel: A cloud-agnostic data platform for the design-driven building of high-availability data science services, Future Generation Computer Systems, 145, pp. 87-103, (2023); Boch, Michael, A Systematic Review of Data Management Platforms, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 469 LNNS, pp. 15-24, (2022); Emerging Architectures for Modern Data Infrastructure, (2020); C4 Model for Visualising Software Architecture, (2018); Cisco Systems Inc 2019, (2019); Clarke, Roger A., Big data, big risks, Information Systems Journal, 26, 1, pp. 77-90, (2016); Cloud Native Computing Foundation 2021, (2023); Data on the Daily Subnational 14 Day Notification Rate of New Covid 19 Cases European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Ecdc, (2022)","A.

This paper addresses these challenges, highlighting the crucial need for synergy between data, engineering expertise, technology, and organizational commitment to convert data-driven insights into tangible efficiency gains and reduced emissions. It details lessons learned from a drilling contractor's perspective in developing and implementing a data-driven performance evaluation system for a fleet of over a hundred onshore rigs. This paper highlights the significance of robust data architecture, which is crucial for improving the system's reliability in developing representative models and metrics for the rig performance evaluation system. These metrics cover multiple dimensions of rig performance, including Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) standards, drilling performance, resource management, and financial metrics. The selection of these metrics and their targets was informed by data trends and stakeholder expectations, with a strong emphasis on prioritizing safety, ensuring that all targets adhered to strict safe operating standards. Initially introduced in 2019, the performance evaluation system underwent a significant update in early 2022 to better reflect the benefits of advancements in automation, technology, and training available to rig crews. An ESG metric was added to the evaluation system to support the organization's commitment to sustainability. This ESG metric employs ensemble machine learning and on-rig edge devices to assess CO2 emissions against modeled targets. The automated system detailed in this paper produces standardized scores based on these metrics, enabling the monthly assessment of individual rig performance, and ensuring continuous improvement aligned with environmental and efficiency goals. Since updating the evaluation system in early 2022, standardized scores have increased by an average of 20% across the fleet. The addition of the ESG metric has led to a 4% reduction in CO2 emissions across the fleet over the past year. The automated performance evaluation system has promoted positive competition among rig crews, motivating them to enhance efficiency and performance. Accurate and representative metrics have been essential for establishing these achievable targets. Additionally, the standardized scores also help technical support staff identify challenges faced by rig crews and determine the necessary training for effectively utilizing drilling automation and optimization technologies available on the rigs. This paper offers valuable insights into the practical challenges and successes associated with the application of digitalization and machine learning in the drilling industry. The focus on reducing emissions and improving fleet-wide performance highlights how drilling contractors can make incremental gains through data-driven insights and a focus on human factors. © 2025, SPE/IADC International Drilling Conference and Exhibition.","","Benchmarking; Compound engines; Costs; Decision making; Drilling platforms; Drilling rigs; Empowerment of personnel; Geochemical surveys; Personnel selection; Personnel training; Waste treatment; Automation technology; CO2 emissions; Data driven; Drilling contractors; Machine-learning; Operational efficiencies; Optimisations; Performance; Performance evaluation system; Real- time; Efficiency","","","","","","","International Gas Research Conference 2024, (2024); Dunbar, Doug, Fit for Purpose Process Automation Drives Consistent Performance in an Operator's West Texas Drilling Program, SPE - International Association of Drilling Contractors Drilling Conference Proceedings, 2024-March, (2024); Godumagadda, Anil, A Platform for Data Science and Analytics at the Edge, SPE - International Association of Drilling Contractors Drilling Conference Proceedings, 2024-March, (2024); Combining Disparate Data Sources Powers Rig Performance Initiatives, (2020); Groh, Alexander, Novel Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Algorithm Detects Mud Motor Stalls for Automated Stall Recovery, Society of Petroleum Engineers - ADIPEC, ADIP 2023, (2023); Groh, Alexander, Speech Recognition Technology Used to Detect Drillstring Breakover and Optimize Drilling Tasks, SPE - International Association of Drilling Contractors Drilling Conference Proceedings, 2024-March, (2024); Groh, Alexander, Rules Engine Exchange: Driving Operational Excellence Through an Advanced Real-Time Alerting System, SPE - International Association of Drilling Contractors Drilling Conference Proceedings, 2022-March, (2022); Kaya, M.

To tackle the issues of inadequate top-level design and methodological support in intelligent coal mine data governance, a methodological system has been developed. The methodological system comprises six key components: theoretical foundation, conceptual model, basic principles, processes and procedures, methods and tools, and evaluation criteria. It systematically clarifies the basis and principles for effectively realizing the goals of intelligent coal mine data governance, and provides the theoretical foundation and methodological support for the top-level design of intelligent coal mine data governance. Meanwhile, the implementation framework for intelligent coal mine data governance is developed with reference to relevant technical standards, which provides specific paths and management methods for the management and implementation of intelligent coal mine data governance. Furthermore, the technical architecture for intelligent coal mine data governance is designed based on the idea of layered architecture to provide technical methods and tools for the technical realization of intelligent coal mine data governance. The following study results have been obtained. ① The theoretical foundation of intelligent coal mine data governance is grounded in complex system theory, data strategy management theory, digital continuity theory, public governance theory, collaborative innovation theory, information lifecycle theory and PDCA cycle theory. ② The conceptual model of intelligent coal mine data governance consists of five core conceptual dimensions: governance philosophy, governance goals, governance subjects, governance objects, and governance processes and tools. It adheres to the principles of business orientation, collaborative governance, culture-driven, technology-enabled, process-embedded, and continuous improvement. ③ The implementation framework of intelligent coal mine data governance delineates the management processes and key procedures from the top down, encompassing four key links of the iterative cycle: coordination and planning, construction and operation, monitoring and evaluation, and improvement and optimization. ④ The technical architecture of the Data Lakehouse for intelligent coal mine describes the system structure and technology selection for the data governance platform. It offers technical methods and tools to facilitate the implementation of intelligent coal mine data governance, with the core focus on developing the five key layers of the data middle platform. ⑤ The data governance capability maturity model for intelligent coal mines provides an assessment criteria framework and capability improvement pathway. It encompasses three dimensions namely, the level of capability maturity, data governance capabilities, and data governance practices.

One of the problems attached to traditional data lakes is the difficulty of retrieving data, which is slow to query, inefficiently, and with high complexities of schema evolution the ability of the data lake to optimize workloads dynamically. To overcome these problems, the work presented in this paper brings forward the concept of an AI-optimized data lake framework that exploits machine learning and deep learning for intelligent data ingestion, adaptive indexing as well as self-optimizing query execution. The system is proposed to incorporate hierarchical storage management with AI-driven, self-studying indexing mechanisms, and reinforcement learning-aided query optimization to improve data retrieval efficiency. Furthermore, through an integrated AI-powered anomaly detection system, data processing is made robust and reliable in real time. On top of that the framework also involves autonomous governance and security that can use explainable AI for compliance auditing and a dynamic role-based access control (RBAC). Experimental evaluations show that, with up to a 90% time saving, and with real-time decision-making capabilities, it improves over both aspects in a variety of data workloads. This research brings forth the integration of AI-based optimizations for the development of a broad and flexible framework for intelligently and scaleably building large data lake architectures, thus becoming the future-ready solution for any big data ecosystem within healthcare, financial, or IoT-based smart systems. © 2025 IEEE.","AI-driven; Hadoop Distributed File System; Healthcare; Role-based access control","Big data; Data handling; Decision making; Deep learning; Digital storage; Hierarchical systems; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Information management; Information retrieval; Lakes; Learning systems; Query processing; Search engines; AI-driven; Distributed file systems; Hadoop distributed file system; Healthcare; High complexity; Queries optimization; Real time data management; Real- time; Role-based Access Control; Schema evolution; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Nambiar, Athira M., An Overview of Data Warehouse and Data Lake in Modern Enterprise Data Management, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 6, 4, (2022); Gupta, Payal, AI-Enabled Process Optimization for Sustainable Wastewater Treatment Solutions, Springer Water, Part F3340, pp. 141-164, (2024); Guim, Francesc, Autonomous Lifecycle Management for Resource-Efficient Workload Orchestration for Green Edge Computing, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, 6, 1, pp. 571-582, (2022); Towards Ethical and Socially Responsible Explainable AI Challenges and Opportunities, (2024); Deploying AI in the Enterprise, (2020); He, Zilong, Research data management in institutional repositories: an architectural approach using data lakehouses, Digital Library Perspectives, 41, 1, pp. 145-178, (2025); International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, (2023); Journal of Bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence, (2021); Journal of Distributed Computing and Systems Jdcs, (2024); Omeiza, Daniel, Explanations in Autonomous Driving: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 23, 8, pp. 10142-10162, (2022)","G.

Over the past decades, with the growing demand for adaptable, expandable, and secure platforms, numerous groundbreaking studies have emerged in the field of ADSP for CPS, DT, and robotics. However, most existing research addresses isolated aspects of AI, CPS, DTs, or robotics, lacking a holistic view of how ADSP expands and optimizes these technologies. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and structured review of the existing methodologies, tools, and techniques at each step of the ADSP workflow, focusing on their applications in CPS, DT, and robotics. Firstly, this survey analyzes the data ingestion phase, focusing on raw data collection architecture, advanced data pre-processing techniques, and data lake integration, while identifying integration and scalability challenges. Secondly, the development methodologies and data analysis techniques within experimental workflows are explored by highlighting widely used tools and real-world case studies. Thirdly, a detailed overview of optimization techniques and deployment strategies is presented, including cloud, edge, and hybrid models, supported by practical deployment examples. Finally, the continuous learning mechanisms are investigated for adaptive system updates, challenges in real-time adaptation, and expanding model performance. Additionally, this survey focuses on evaluation metrics, benchmark studies, and performance comparisons to assess platform efficiency across various domains.

Traditional risk monitoring systems cannot effectively accommodate complex data flows and real-time risk changes, which often leads to false positives and delays. This study proposes a framework based on 'big data lake-semantic layer-intelligent algorithm' to achieve real-time and interpretable financial risk monitoring. Through the multi-modal risk representation combined with the hybrid flow-batch pipeline and knowledge graph, the real-time synchronization of risk scoring and response strategy is realized by using a state machine-driven feedback loop and adaptive threshold adjustment. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the framework is improved by more than 10%, the false alarm rate is reduced to 1.8%, and the response time is shortened to 250 milliseconds.

Govt.Arts College for Women, Mayiladuthurai, India","The need for effective Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) technologies that can manage the growing volumes of both structured and unstructured data in information lakehouse architectures is increasing due to the rapid expansion of data environments. Existing ETL systems struggle with performance, scalability, and adaptability, making it difficult to handle the rising demands of both batch and real-time data processing. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Hybrid ETL Infrastructure that combines contextual data partitioning with AI-driven orchestration to optimize data ingestion and real-time analysis in information lakehouses. The system addresses key issues, such as inefficient data handling, slow processing times, and inadequate transformation methods, by dynamically adjusting the ETL pipeline based on user requests, context-aware partitioning, and data characteristics. The AI-driven orchestration ensures efficient job scheduling by seamlessly switching between batch and real-time processing based on data importance, thereby improving both performance and flexibility. Contextual partitioning reduces processing costs and enhances query performance by automatically organizing data according to domain-specific knowledge and query intent.

As an example, the raw materials received from suppliers differ from one another, though within tolerances. And similar variations appear in all areas of manufacturing, such as tool wearing, the statuses of production machines, and even operator decisions. Improvements to production must factor in technical considerations and economic ones. Several points of view must be included to determine the best solution. Even when applying artificial intelligence (AI) in the manufacturing process, the situation should be similar: Several agents with different goals should interact to determine the most holistic solution.

Given that most of the time, the operator's decision is based on intuition and experience, not based on data analysis, this paper also analyses which data architecture will permit the data analysis of raw materials, finished products, tooling characteristics and statuses, machine parameters, and external conditions, to minimize the influence of intuition and personal bias on decision-making in manufacturing. © The Author(s) 2024.

However, this centralized architecture is limited by the proliferation of data sources and the growing demand for timely analysis and processing. A new data paradigm, Data Mesh, is proposed to overcome these challenges. In this decentralized architecture where data is locally preserved by each domain team, traditional centralized machine learning cannot conduct effective analysis across multiple domains, especially for security-sensitive organizations. To this end, we introduce a pioneering approach that incorporates Federated Learning into Data Mesh.

The scarcity of data, particularly in certain domains, constrains the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, hindering progress and innovation. This project endeavours to alleviate this bottleneck through the development of Synthium AI, a platform that provides easy access to advanced Synthetic Tabular Data Generation Deep Neural Network Models. Synthium AI leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to perform Synthetic Tabular Data Generation (STDG), focusing on a wide range of tabular datasets. By democratizing access to high-quality synthetic data, Synthium AI empowers stakeholders to overcome the challenges posed by data scarcity, facilitating innovation and progress in various domains. As AI applications become increasingly prevalent, the ability to generate synthetic datasets emerges as an enabler, bridging the gap created by data limitations and fostering advancements in AI research and applications. While the current implementation focuses on tabular data, future work will extend Synthium AI's capabilities to address challenges in computer vision and image processing. © This is an open access article published by the IET under the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)","Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs); Synthetic Data Architecture; Synthetic Data Generation; Synthium AI Platform; Tabular Data","Adversarial machine learning; Data assimilation; Deep neural networks; Adversarial networks; Data architectures; Data generation; Data scarcity; Generative adversarial network; Synthetic data; Synthetic data architecture; Synthetic data generations; Synthium artificial intelligence platform; Tabular data; Generative adversarial networks","","","","","","","Cryptocurrency Timeseries 2020 Dataset; Generative Adversarial Networks; Google Drive API Overview Google for Developers; Gretelai Gretel Synthetics, (2020); Json Web Token Jwt, (2015); A Style Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks, (2018); Kolmogorov Smirnov Test Wikipedia; Lin, Zinan, Using GANs for Sharing Networked Time Series Data: Challenges, Initial Promise, and Open Questions, Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference, IMC, pp. 464-483, (2020); Quality Report Sdmetrics, (2023); Radford, Alec, Unsupervised representation learning with deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, 4th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2016 - Conference Track Proceedings, (2016)","","","Institution of Engineering and Technology","Collins Aerospace; JLR; Qualcomm; Valeo","26th Irish Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference, IMVIP 2024","2024-08-21 through 2024-08-23","Limerick","206271","","9781807050351; 9781807050207; 9781837247257; 9781837249916; 9781807050375; 9781837245277; 9781837247295; 9781837247264; 9781837247325; 9781839537776","","","English","IET.

The “Framework for Spatiotemporal Production Data Acquisition” (PathSense) aims to improve access and usability of production data by applying a common data ecosystem. Through integrating operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT), PathSense supports decision-making and process optimization. The framework uses the concept of digital shadows to collect critical information from sensors within the continuous manufacturing processes, e.g., welding or gluing lines. Spatial and temporal digital shadows are developed in accordance with human spatial cognition to support sophisticated-yet intuitive-human-computer interactions without the need for advanced data science skills. The backbone of the framework consists of robust data pipelines with a setup incorporating modern IT protocols, such as OPC UA and MQTT, to support the efficient acquisition and management of data. The paper addresses the challenges associated with the combination of IT and OT in cyber-physical systems, stressing modern complex data-intensive manufacturing as one exemplary domain to be tackled by scalable and secure data architectures. The paper identifies two major future directions: refining data integration processes and embedding advanced machine learning algorithms to enable automated data analysis and improve process quality monitoring. In summary, PathSense proposes a data-driven approach for quality inspection in manufacturing, which may eventually enhance industry practices and move towards data-driven decisions and increased operational flexibility. © 2024 The Authors.

The “Framework for Spatiotemporal Production Data Acquisition” (PathSense) aims to improve access and usability of production data by applying a common data ecosystem. Through integrating operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT), PathSense supports decision-making and process optimization. The framework uses the concept of digital shadows to collect critical information from sensors within the continuous manufacturing processes, e.g., welding or gluing lines. Spatial and temporal digital shadows are developed in accordance with human spatial cognition to support sophisticated-yet intuitive-human-computer interactions without the need for advanced data science skills. The backbone of the framework consists of robust data pipelines with a setup incorporating modern IT protocols, such as OPC UA and MQTT, to support the efficient acquisition and management of data. The paper addresses the challenges associated with the combination of IT and OT in cyber-physical systems, stressing modern complex data-intensive manufacturing as one exemplary domain to be tackled by scalable and secure data architectures. The paper identifies two major future directions: refining data integration processes and embedding advanced machine learning algorithms to enable automated data analysis and improve process quality monitoring. In summary, PathSense proposes a data-driven approach for quality inspection in manufacturing, which may eventually enhance industry practices and move towards data-driven decisions and increased operational flexibility. © 2024 The Authors.","AI; data acquisition; defect detection; digital twin; MQTT; OPC UA; PathSense; spatiotemporal analysis; welding process","Data assimilation; Data integration; Gluing; Manufacturing data processing; Network security; Process control; Smart manufacturing; Defect detection; MQTT; OPC UA; Operational technologies; Path-based; Pathsense; Production data; Spatiotemporal analysis; Welding applications; Welding process; Spatio-temporal data","","","","","Technische Universität München, TUM","The results presented in this paper were achieved under the strategic leadership and orchestration of BMW Group.

Although a variety of indices exist to assess digital health systems, questions arise about the inclusion of indicators of information and communications technology maturity and readiness, digital (health) literacy, and interest in DiPH tools by the society and workforce, as well as the maturity of the legal framework and the readiness of digitalized health systems. Existing tools frequently target one of these domains while overlooking the others. In addition, no review has yet holistically investigated the available national DiPH system maturity and readiness indicators using a multidisciplinary lens. Objective: We used a narrative review to map the landscape of DiPH system maturity and readiness indicators published in the gray literature. Methods: As original indicators were not published in scientific databases, we applied predefined search strings to the DuckDuckGo and Google search engines for 11 countries from all continents that had reached level 4 of 5 in the latest Global Digital Health Monitor evaluation. In addition, we searched the literature published by 19 international organizations for maturity and readiness indicators concerning DiPH. Results: Of the 1484 identified references, 137 were included, and they yielded 15,806 indicators. We deemed 286 indicators from 90 references relevant for DiPH system maturity and readiness assessments. The majority of these indicators (133/286, 46.5%) had legal relevance (targeting big data and artificial intelligence regulation, cybersecurity, national DiPH strategies, or health data governance), and the smallest number of indicators (37/286, 12.9%) were related to social domains (focusing on internet use and access, digital literacy and digital health literacy, or the use of DiPH tools, smartphones, and computers). Another 14.3% (41/286) of indicators analyzed the information and communications technology infrastructure (such as workforce, electricity, internet, and smartphone availability or interoperability standards). The remaining 26.2% (75/286) of indicators described the degree to which DiPH was applied (including health data architecture, storage, and access; the implementation of DiPH interventions; or the existence of interventions promoting health literacy and digital inclusion). Conclusions: Our work is the first to conduct a multidisciplinary analysis of the gray literature on DiPH maturity and readiness assessments. Although new methods for systematically researching gray literature are needed, our study holds the potential to develop more comprehensive tools for DiPH system assessments. We contributed toward a more holistic understanding of DiPH. Further examination is required to analyze the suitability and applicability of all identified indicators in diverse health care settings. By developing a standardized method to assess DiPH system maturity and readiness, we aim to foster informed decision-making among health care planners and practitioners to improve resource distribution and continue to drive innovation in health care delivery. ©Laura Maaß, Manuel Badino, Ihoghosa Iyamu, Felix Holl.","digital health; digital public health; gray literature; health system; indicator; information and communications technology; interdisciplinary; maturity assessment; mobile phone; narrative review; readiness assessment","digital technology; human; procedures; public health; Digital Technology; Humans; Public Health","","","","","British Institute of Persian Studies, BIPS; Leibniz-Gemeinschaft, LG, (W72/2022); Leibniz-Gemeinschaft, LG","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of Leibniz Science Campus Bremen Digital Public Health, which is jointly funded by the Leibniz Association (W72/2022), the federal state of Bremen, and the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology\u2013BIPS.","Report of the Expert Panel on Effective Ways of Investing in Health Exph, (2019); Saiso, Sebastián García, Digital Transformation for More Equitable and Sustainable Public Health in the Age of Digital Interdependence, American Journal of Public Health, 112, pp. S621-S624, (2022); Iyamu, Ihoghosa Osamuyi, Defining digital public health and the role of digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation: Scoping review, JMIR Public Health and Surveillance, 7, 11, (2021); Odone, Anna, Public health digitalization in Europe, European Journal of Public Health, 29, pp. 28-35, (2019); Gunasekeran, Dinesh Visva, Digital health during COVID-19: lessons from operationalising new models of care in ophthalmology, The Lancet Digital Health, 3, 2, pp. e124-e134, (2021); Kickbusch, Ilona S., The Lancet and Financial Times Commission on governing health futures 2030: growing up in a digital world, The Lancet, 398, 10312, pp. 1727-1776, (2021); Future of the Public S Health in the 21st Century, (2003); Digital Technologies for Key Public Health Functions Results of an Ecdc Expert Consultation, (2021); Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020 2025; Golden Opportunity of Digital Health for Latin America and the Caribbean, (2022)","L.

Leveraging on its local regulatory advantage, consisting of petroleum engineering expertise and mass data from all the operating fields, the digitalisation of offset data into machine learning (ML) has enabled the nation's predictive solution to improve sand management strategy decision making. The intelligent sand management system is developed through reliable ML interpretation principle to tackle the nation's sand control challenges. The system is trained to analyse rock mechanic data using several key parameters to predict unconfined compressive strength (UCS) value as the pre-requisite for sand production prediction. It analyses the subsurface sand management data lake and, with the system calculated UCS value, the suitable downhole sand control (DHSC) method will be advised based on well design inputs. The proposed DHSC design's high level well cost is also generated based on benchmarking. Sand encroachment from producing sand reservoirs is one of the key issues in oil and gas wells. The erosion consequences in production facility due to sand production normally result in well integrity concern, loss of primary containment (LOPC) risk and subsequently the domino effect of undesirable health, safety and environmental (HSE) incident(s) at operators' producing asset. Conventional well completion design addressing sand control requires significant time and resources to gather and perform sanding analyses and risk ranking from scattered subsurface data. Besides that, a costly reservoir sand core sample test and time-consuming studies for its strength normally will be performed to assist in better well design sanding risk profiling. It is common for the executed downhole sand control selection to be sub-optimum, resulting in earlier end of well productivity or costly remedial works. However, the developed system can significantly reduce the sand control selection analyses and decision-making duration. It serves as a solution for the unavailability of core samples for UCS tests, or cost saving for marginal operator on rock mechanic test avoidance. The optimised DHSC algorithm provides better long-term sand control success rate and well life longevity. The system has proven data analytics result of above 0.91 R-Squared (R2) accuracy. A similar approach can be referred by the industry to minimise sand control issue in current cost saving and digital business operating rhythm. This digital transformation approach has also contributed to reducing equivalent greenhouse emission from carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) compared to traditional UCS laboratory test and lengthy DHSC method analysis processes. © 2024, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","","Benchmarking; Cost engineering; Damage detection; Empowerment of personnel; Enhanced recovery; Natural gas well completion; Nuclear magnetic logging; Oil well completion; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Production control; Radioactivity logging; Risk management; Sand consolidation; Sanding equipment; Six sigma; Strategic planning; Thermal logging; Waste treatment; Digital transformation; Downholes; Machine-learning; Malaysia; Oil and gas well; Sand control; Sand management; Sand production; Strength values; Unconfined compressive strength; Decision making","","","","","","","A Sand Management System for Mature Offshore Production Facilities Iptc 12784 MS International Petroleum Technology Conference, (2008); Sanfilippo, Francesco, Sand production: From prediction to management, SPE - European Formation Damage Control Conference, Proceedings, pp. 389-396, (1997); Ben Mahmud, Hisham Khaled, Sand production: A smart control framework for risk mitigation, Petroleum, 6, 1, pp. 1-13, (2020); Morita, Nobuo, Typical sand production problems.

The term Industry 4.0 was introduced in 2011 as part of a technology-based manufacturing project by Germany. The I4.0 came into existence because of the advancements in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, the Internet of Things, and computing technologies. Digital Twin (DT) is a major concept based on the I4.0 technologies and has shown a continuous increase in interest by the industry and research community. This chapter explores the evolution of DT in manufacturing and report various definitions and their scope, architectures, tools/methodologies used in developing DT, and its applications in manufacturing. The DT concept is still evolving and there is a lack of a standard definition and unified architecture for DT application in manufacturing. The interoperability of data and lifecycle maintenance of DT are two big challenges for the adoption of DT in manufacturing industries. Integration of human expertise, improvement of communication protocols, and use of cognition in DT needs to be further explored by the research community. Decision support for decentralized manufacturing, validation of DT model, creation of data lake for digitalization, and DT for inspection are areas where a lot of further research is desired. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Data driven models; Digital twin; Digitalization in manufacturing; Fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0); IoT; Simulation","","","","","","","","Konstantinov Et Al, (2021); undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; Alam, Kazi Masudul, C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 2050-2062, (2017); Alexopoulos, Kosmas, Digital twin-driven supervised machine learning for the development of artificial intelligence applications in manufacturing, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 33, 5, pp. 429-439, (2020); Angrish, Atin, A flexible data schema and system architecture for the virtualization of manufacturing machines (VMM), Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 45, pp. 236-247, (2017); undefined","K.S.

We present Triage-Bot, an online medical triage provisioning service, that can revolutionize emergency care by decreasing the load on emergency departments (ED), reducing healthcare expenses, and improving the quality of care. Empowered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the Triage-Bot service assesses and prioritizes patients' needs based on symptoms, medical history, and perceived conditions from multimodal video, audio, and text data captured during patients' interactions. The captured summarized information with a severity ranking is sent to a human expert to suggest the next action on the user's part. The diverse data types used by the Triage-Bot in communication, authentication, data collection, storage, and analytics requires a robust and scalable system architecture for online service provisioning. In this paper, we specifically focus on the system design and architecture of the Triage-Bot for emergency healthcare settings. With integrated electronic medical records (EMR) and online platforms, the bot fosters collaboration among healthcare professionals and enables swift and informed decision-making even in the face of crises. By partially automating and offering a hybrid triage process, the Triage-Bot improves resource allocation, reduces healthcare management costs for emergency care, minimizes patient waiting times, and improves wellbeing. To address the complexities and demands of healthcare data management, our proposed system incorporates MongoDB database for flexibility, scalability, and versatility in supporting different types of data. Additionally, we implement a data linking and analytics pipeline utilizing a data Lakehouse system to effectively ingest, manage, process, and generate knowledge from heterogeneous data sources. © 2024 IEEE.","Data Lakehouse; Database; Healthcare Management; Triage bot","COVID-19; Electronic health record; Emergency services; Hospital data processing; Information management; Metadata; Network security; Quality of service; Steganography; Data analytics; Data lakehouse; Emergency care; Emergency departments; Emergency healthcares; Health-care managements; Healthcare systems; Management architectures; Triage bot; Web based; Decision making","","","","","International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Mitacs; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","We gratefully acknowledge the support of NSERC Canada, CFI, IBM, Mitacs, IBM and MarkiTech for their funding of our project","Li, Wei, A Comprehensive Survey on Machine Learning-Based Big Data Analytics for IoT-Enabled Smart Healthcare System, Mobile Networks and Applications, 26, 1, pp. 234-252, (2021); Awotunde, Joseph Bamidele, Big Data and Data Analytics for an Enhanced COVID-19 Epidemic Management, Studies in Systems, Decision and Control, 358, pp. 11-29, (2021); Leclerc, Thomas, Prioritisation of ICU treatments for critically ill patients in a COVID-19 pandemic with scarce resources, Anaesthesia Critical Care and Pain Medicine, 39, 3, pp. 333-339, (2020); Townsend, Beverley A., Medical practitioner perspectives on AI in emergency triage, Frontiers in Digital Health, 5, (2023); Salman, Omar Hussein, A review on utilizing machine learning technology in the fields of electronic emergency triage and patient priority systems in telemedicine: Coherent taxonomy, motivations, open research challenges and recommendations for intelligent future work, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 209, (2021); Handbook of Global Health, (2020); Bullard, Michael J., Revisions to the Canadian emergency department triage and acuity scale (CTAS) guidelines, Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine, 16, 6, pp. 485-489, (2014); Nam Perspectives, (2020); Sadman, Nafiz, Vulnerability of Open-Source Face Recognition Systems to Blackbox Attacks: A Case Study with InsightFace, 2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2023, pp. 1164-1169, (2023); Pepin, Ian, Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Keyword-Based Classification of Unstructured Text Data, Proceedings - 2024 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things, DCOSS-IoT 2024, pp. 203-210, (2024)","","Shahriar, H.; Ohsaki, H.; Sharmin, M.; Towey, D.; Majumder, AKM.J.A.; Hori, Y.; Yang, J.-J.; Takemoto, M.; Sakib, N.; Banno, R.; Ahamed, S.I.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","48th IEEE Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2024","2024-07-02 through 2024-07-04","Osaka","202071","","9798350376968","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Annu.

This siloed approach creates a lock-in scenario, limiting the potential for effective data exploitation, including the provision of added-value services, artificial intelligence, or machine-learning activities. To overcome this challenge, ensuring data integration through interoperability mechanisms becomes crucial within building data management frameworks. In line with this perspective, this work introduces a data lake that harmonizes heterogeneous data sources from various building domains. The primary goal is to standardize datasets, ensuring the delivery of high-quality services to facilitate better decision-making. These datasets are enriched by interactions between static and dynamic datasets. This holistic approach aims to break down silos and unlock the full potential of building data for informed decision-making processes. © 2024 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Buildings; Data integration; Decision making; Information management; Added-value services; Artificial intelligence learning; Automation networks; Dynamic data; Energy; Heterogeneous sources; Learning Activity; Lock-in; Machine-learning; Static datum; Lakes","","","","","European Commission, EC; HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme","Horizon Europe programme GA #101069658 The authors of this paper would like to thank DigiBUILD consortium, especially pilot leaders, and in particular the HERON pilot responsible, involved in the project for providing pilot data.

The existing systems are confronted with certain constraints, including incomplete data, insufficient documentation for storage, and a requirement for a scalable infrastructure for big data analytics, such as a data warehouse or data lakehouse. To address this issue, the paper presents a design and implementation of a coffee commodity trading big data warehouse capable of analyzing various essential parameters for supporting informed decision-making. First, the designed system can automatically collect coffee trading data for New York Arabica coffee futures prices from selected worldwide reports and financial data portals. Next, the Extract, transform, and load (ETL) process is adopted to ingest coffee futures trading crawled data into the 3 layers data warehouse. Finally, the analytical system will extract and visualize selected key dimensions that influence coffee futures prices within different observation windows and perspectives. As a result, we implement a prototype of a coffee trading data warehouse on the crawled data from January 2000 to October 2022 and visualize trends in coffee futures prices based on the collected data for informed decision-making. The construction system is capable of stably operating and processing large volumes of transaction data. This paper will be valuable documentation for reference and decision support for coffee commodity trading enterprises and contribute to the development of future forecasting algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.","big data; Coffee big data; coffee commodity trading; data visualization; data warehouse; ETL process; informed decision-making","Big data; Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Data visualization; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Financial markets; Visualization; Coffee big data; Coffee commodity trading; Commodities trading; Data mining technology; Decisions makings; Extract, transform, and load process; Informed decision; Informed decision-making; Market data; Predictive models; Decision making","","","","","","","Ponte, Stefano, The 'Latte Revolution'?

Such inaccuracies can have serious consequences such as inaccurate decision-making, the spread of false information, privacy violations, legal liabilities, and more. Although efforts to address these risks are underway, including explainable AI and AI regulation practices such as transparency, privacy protection, bias mitigation, and social and environmental responsibility, misinformation caused by generative AI will remain a significant challenge. We propose that verifying the outputs of generative AI from a data management perspective is an emerging issue for generative AI. This involves analyzing the underlying data from multi-modal data lakes, including text files, tables, and knowledge graphs, and assessing its quality and consistency. By doing so, we can establish a stronger foundation for evaluating the outputs of generative AI models. Such an approach can ensure the correctness of generative AI, promote transparency, and enable decision-making with greater confidence. Our vision is to promote the development of verifiable generative AI and contribute to a more trustworthy and responsible use of AI. © 2024 CIDR.

Flooding has a major impact on people's lives and livelihoods. The impact of flood disasters on human lives can be mitigated by developing effective flood forecasting and prediction models. The majority of flood prediction models do not take all flood-causing factors into account when they are designed. It is difficult to collect and handle some of these flood-causing variables since they are heterogeneous in nature. This paper presents a new big data architecture called Data Lake, which can ingest and store all important flood-causing heterogeneous data sources in their raw format for machine learning model creation. The statistical relevance of important flood producing factors on flood prediction outcome is determined utilizing inferential statistical approaches. The outcome of this research is to create flood warning systems that can alert the public and government officials so that they can make decisions in the event of a severe flood, reducing socioeconomic loss. • Flood causing factors are from heterogeneous sources, so there is no big data architecture for handling variety of data sources. • To provide data architectural solution using data lake for collecting and analysing heterogeneous flood causing factors. • Uses inferential statistical approach to determine importance of different flood causing factors in design of efficient flood prediction models. © 2023 The Author(s)","Data Lake; Flood causing vital factors; Flood Prediction","article; big data; data source; decision support system; flooding; government employee; human; machine learning; prediction; statistical significance","","","","","","","Ndtv, (2019); undefined; International Journal of Computer Applications, (2015); Zhang, Meng, Secure beamforming for untrusted MISO cognitive radio networks, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 17, 7, pp. 4861-4872, (2018); International Journal of Geomatics and Geosciences, (2010); Biosci Biotechnol Res Commun Spec Issue, (2019); Bande, Swapnil, Smart flood disaster prediction system using IoT & neural networks, Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference On Smart Technology for Smart Nation, SmartTechCon 2017, pp. 189-194, (2018); Widiasari, Indrastanti Ratna, Deep learning multilayer perceptron (MLP) for flood prediction model using wireless sensor network based hydrology time series data mining, Proceedings - 2017 International Conference on Innovative and Creative Information Technology: Computational Intelligence and IoT, ICITech 2017, 2018-January, pp. 1-5, (2017); Khanna, Nitin, OFFM-ANFIS analysis for flood prediction using mobile IoS, fog and cloud computing, Cluster Computing, 23, 4, pp. 2659-2676, (2020); Sood, Sandeep K., IoT, big data and HPC based smart flood management framework, Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems, 20, pp. 102-117, (2018)","B.D.

Aiming to facilitate diagnostic decision making and improve the workload of pathologists, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based prescreening tool that analyses whole-slide images (WSIs) of large-bowel biopsies to identify typical, non-neoplastic, and neoplastic biopsies. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted with an internal development cohort of slides acquired from a hospital in the UK and three external validation cohorts of WSIs acquired from two hospitals in the UK and one clinical laboratory in Portugal. To learn the differential histological patterns from digitised WSIs of large-bowel biopsy slides, our proposed weakly supervised deep-learning model (Colorectal AI Model for Abnormality Detection [CAIMAN]) used slide-level diagnostic labels and no detailed cell or region-level annotations. The method was developed with an internal development cohort of 5054 biopsy slides from 2080 patients that were labelled with corresponding diagnostic categories assigned by pathologists. The three external validation cohorts, with a total of 1536 slides, were used for independent validation of CAIMAN. Each WSI was classified into one of three classes (ie, typical, atypical non-neoplastic, and atypical neoplastic). Prediction scores of image tiles were aggregated into three prediction scores for the whole slide, one for its likelihood of being typical, one for its likelihood of being non-neoplastic, and one for its likelihood of being neoplastic. The assessment of the external validation cohorts was conducted by the trained and frozen CAIMAN model. To evaluate model performance, we calculated area under the convex hull of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve, and specificity compared with our previously published iterative draw and rank sampling (IDaRS) algorithm. We also generated heat maps and saliency maps to analyse and visualise the relationship between the WSI diagnostic labels and spatial features of the tissue microenvironment. The main outcome of this study was the ability of CAIMAN to accurately identify typical and atypical WSIs of colon biopsies, which could potentially facilitate automatic removing of typical biopsies from the diagnostic workload in clinics. Findings: A randomly selected subset of all large bowel biopsies was obtained between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2017. The AI training, validation, and assessments were done between Jan 1, 2021, and Sept 30, 2022. WSIs with diagnostic labels were collected between Jan 1 and Sept 30, 2022. Our analysis showed no statistically significant differences across prediction scores from CAIMAN for typical and atypical classes based on anatomical sites of the biopsy. At 0·99 sensitivity, CAIMAN (specificity 0·5592) was more accurate than an IDaRS-based weakly supervised WSI-classification pipeline (0·4629) in identifying typical and atypical biopsies on cross-validation in the internal development cohort (p<0·0001). At 0·99 sensitivity, CAIMAN was also more accurate than IDaRS for two external validation cohorts (p<0·0001), but not for a third external validation cohort (p=0·10). CAIMAN provided higher specificity than IDaRS at some high-sensitivity thresholds (0·7763 vs 0·6222 for 0·95 sensitivity, 0·7126 vs 0·5407 for 0·97 sensitivity, and 0·5615 vs 0·3970 for 0·99 sensitivity on one of the external validation cohorts) and showed high classification performance in distinguishing between neoplastic biopsies (AUROC 0·9928, 95% CI 0·9927–0·9929), inflammatory biopsies (0·9658, 0·9655–0·9661), and atypical biopsies (0·9789, 0·9786–0·9792). On the three external validation cohorts, CAIMAN had AUROC values of 0·9431 (95% CI 0·9165–0·9697), 0·9576 (0·9568–0·9584), and 0·9636 (0·9615–0·9657) for the detection of atypical biopsies. Saliency maps supported the representation of disease heterogeneity in model predictions and its association with relevant histological features. Interpretation: CAIMAN, with its high sensitivity in detecting atypical large-bowel biopsies, might be a promising improvement in clinical workflow efficiency and diagnostic decision making in prescreening of typical colorectal biopsies.

However, they also cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that can be challenging to predict, prevent and treat. Although they likely interact with health-related quality of life (HRQoL), most existing evidence on this topic has come from clinical trials with eligibility criteria that may not accurately reflect real-world settings. The QUALITOP project will study HRQoL in relation to irAEs and its determinants in a real-world study of patients treated with immunotherapy. Methods and analysis This international, observational, multicentre study takes place in France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. We aim to include about 1800 adult patients with cancer treated with immunotherapy in a specifically recruited prospective cohort, and to additionally obtain data from historical real-world databases (ie, databiobanks) and medical administrative registries (ie, national cancer registries) in which relevant data regarding other adult patients with cancer treated with immunotherapy has already been stored. In the prospective cohort, clinical health status, HRQoL and psychosocial well-being will be monitored until 18 months after treatment initiation through questionnaires (at baseline and 3, 6, 12 and 18 months thereafter), and by data extraction from electronic patient files. Using advanced statistical methods, including causal inference methods, artificial intelligence algorithms and simulation modelling, we will use data from the QUALITOP cohort to improve the understanding of the complex relationships among treatment regimens, patient characteristics, irAEs and HRQoL. Ethics and dissemination All aspects of the QUALITOP project will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with ethical approval from a suitable local ethics committee, and all patients will provide signed informed consent. In addition to standard dissemination efforts in the scientific literature, the data and outcomes will contribute to a smart digital platform and medical data lake. These will (1) help increase knowledge about the impact of immunotherapy, (2) facilitate improved interactions between patients, clinicians and the general population and (3) contribute to personalised medicine.

The benefits of deep learning (DL) are manifold, but it comes with limitations that have – so far – interfered with widespread industry adoption. This paper explains why DL – despite its popularity – has difficulties speeding up its adoption within business analytics. It is shown that the adoption of deep learning is not only affected by computational complexity, lacking big data architecture, lack of transparency (black-box), skill shortage, and leadership commitment, but also by the fact that DL does not outperform traditional ML models in the case of structured datasets with fixed-length feature vectors. Deep learning should be regarded as a powerful addition to the existing body of ML models instead of a “one size fits all” solution. The results strongly suggest that gradient boosting can be seen as the go-to model for predictions on structured datasets within business analytics. In addition to the empirical study based on three industry use cases, the paper offers a comprehensive discussion of those results, practical implications, and a roadmap for future research. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Business analytics; Data-driven decision making; Deep Learning; Digital strategy; Digital transformation; Machine learning","","","","","","","","Addo, Peter Martey, Credit risk analysis using machine and deep learning models, Risks, 6, 2, (2018); Economics of Artificial Intelligence an Agenda, (2019); Baesens, Bart M.M., Transformational issues of big data and analytics in networked business, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 40, 4, pp. 807-818, (2016); Bertsimas, Dimitris J., From predictive to prescriptive analytics, Management Science, 66, 3, pp. 1025-1044, (2020); Borges, Aline De Fatima Soares, The strategic use of artificial intelligence in the digital era: Systematic literature review and future research directions, International Journal of Information Management, 57, (2021); Breiman, Leo, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Bücker, Michael, Transparency, auditability, and explainability of machine learning models in credit scoring, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 73, 1, pp. 70-90, (2022); Artificial Intelligence, (2017); undefined, (2019); Chen, Hsinchun Chun, Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impact, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 36, 4, pp. 1165-1188, (2012)","","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","","","","","English","Int.

Traditional production systems, often marred by inefficiencies stemming from data opacity, have encountered bottlenecks that throttle scalability and adaptability, particularly in complex, fluctuating markets. By harnessing the voluminous streams of data-both structured and unstructured-generated in contemporary production environments, and subjecting these data lakes to advanced ML algorithms, we unveil profound insights and predictive patterns that remain elusive under conventional analytical methods. Our discourse juxtaposes the multidimensionality of Big Data-emphasizing velocity, variety, veracity, and volume-with the finesse of ML models, such as neural networks and reinforcement learning, which adapt iteratively to the dynamism inherent in production landscapes. This symbiosis underpins a more holistic, anticipatory decision-making process, empowering stakeholders to pinpoint and mitigate operational hiccups, optimize supply chain vectors, and streamline quality assurance protocols, thereby catalyzing a more resilient, responsive, and cost-effective production framework. Furthermore, we explore the ethical contours of data stewardship in this context, advocating for a judicious balance between technological ascendancy and responsible data governance. The culmination of this exploration is the conceptualization of a predictive, self-regulating production ecosystem that thrives on continuous learning and improvement, dynamically calibrating itself in response to an ever-evolving market tableau and thereby heralding a new era of optimal, sustainable, and intelligent production management. © 2023, Science and Information Organization.

Microgrids support a low-carbon future, as these flexible, efficient, and localised electric grids enable the integration of the ever-growing deployment of distributed Renewable Energy Resources (RESs). Promoting sustainable power and demand side management, microgrids can strengthen grid resilience and help mitigate grid disturbances, as well as function as an auxiliary grid resource for faster system response and recovery. SEMS platforms have the ability to augment, in a coordinated manner, the contribution from RESs which can be inherently volatile in nature. Today's power supply network Model Predictive Control (MPC) systems heavily rely on 'big data' to deliver optimal schedules, whilst anticipating future behaviour and system deviations. As national and intercontinental grids become more complex and intertwined, petabyte data lakes are required to feed data-driven analytics to optimally control Energy Management Systems (EMSs). Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive review of Data-driven Energy Management Systems (DDEMS), focusing on their respective decision-making and forecasting techniques (point and interval) to augment the control of non-linear systems. Furthermore, the deterministic and probabilistic forecasting methods implemented within the governing algorithms to capture the uncertainties due to RES variability are examined. © 2023 IEEE.","data-driven microgrid; decision-making; deep learning and machine learning forecast; Microgrid; smart energy management system","Decision making; Deep learning; Electric power distribution; Electric power system control; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Forecasting; Information management; Learning systems; Linear systems; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Data driven; Data-driven microgrid; Decisions makings; Deep learning and machine learning forecast; Low-carbon futures; Machine-learning; Microgrid; Smart energies; Smart energy management system; Energy management systems","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (18/CRT/6222); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI","This publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland under Grant number 18/CRT/6222.","Ember Global Electricity Review, (2022); undefined, (2021); Cai, Liya, Pathways for electric power industry to achieve carbon emissions peak and carbon neutrality based on LEAP model: A case study of state-owned power generation enterprise in China, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 170, (2022); Sedhom, Bishoy E., IoT-based optimal demand side management and control scheme for smart microgrid, International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 127, (2021); undefined, (2022); undefined, (2022); undefined, (2021); Wang, Yafei, Evaluation of economic benefits of virtual power plant between demand and plant sides based on cooperative game theory, Energy Conversion and Management, 238, (2021); Sheha, Moataz N., Techno-economic analysis of the impact of dynamic electricity prices on solar penetration in a smart grid environment with distributed energy storage, Applied Energy, 282, (2021); Carbon","","Sandikkaya, M.T.; Usta, O.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","EnerjiSA; IEEE PES; Omicron Bahrain; SEL","2023 IEEE PES Generation, Transmission and Distribution International Conference and Exposition, GTD 2023","2023-05-22 through 2023-05-25","Istanbul","193091","","9781728170251","","","English","Proc. - IEEE PES GTD Int.

Furthermore, there is a need to reduce the gap on time from when information is created to when actions and insights can be offered. However, a challenge in implementing a large-scale data processing architecture is deciding which tools are appropriate, and how to apply them in the best way possible. For example, streaming systems are now mature enough that hospitals worldwide can use their extremely large datasets, along with data producers, to predict and influence future events. Thus, the main objective of this systematic review is to identify the state-of-the-art in data platforms on healthcare that allow the creation of metrics and actions in real-time. The PRISMA guideline for reporting systematic reviews was implemented to deliver a transparent and consistent report, validating the technological advances in a critical sector. Multiple pertinent articles and papers were retrieved from the SCOPUS abstract and citation database on May 13, 2022, using several relevant keywords to identify potentially relevant documents published from January 2020 onward. These documents must have already been published in English and been already published, and accessible through the B-ON consortium that allows Portuguese students to legally download from most publishers. Over seven studies have been selected for deeper discussion based on their relevance and impact for this review, showcasing their main objectives, data sources, and tools used, as well as their approaches for interoperability and support of machine learning algorithms for decision support. In closing, the collected articles have shown that while Big Data is currently in use at health institutions of all sizes, the ability of processing large amounts of data from sensors and events, and notifying stakeholders as quickly as possible is still in its infancy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

The traditional approach adopted by these systems, are based on common architectures represented in most of the time by the data warehouses. These works with relational database systems supporting data of structured type as well. However, the decision-making process is often not limited to structured data. Indeed, with the emergence of Big Data, the value of data can also be extracted from massive data sources containing data of diverse types, structured, semi-structured and unstructured. As a result, NoSQL systems have been integrated into the architecture of decision support system, in parallel with data warehouses, in order to overcome their limitations regarding Big Data characteristics. In this sense, this article presents a synthetic literature review on the work done in recent years, treating the hybridization of traditional systems with NoSQL databases, including relational databases and traditional data warehouses. We aim by this work to scheme the limits of the existing approaches and to determine the most fitting characteristics for the design of a hybrid architecture suitable for the migration of companies to Big Data architectures. Furthermore, we discussed the utility of implementing a data lake in decision support system architecture: On one hand as a way to solve the problems related to information silos that current architectures encounter and on the other hand, as an upgrading technique for traditional decision support system architecture. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data; Data warehouse; Decision support system; Hybrid systems; NoSQL systems; Relational databases","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer architecture; Data warehouses; Decision making; Digital storage; Hybrid systems; Relational database systems; Common architecture; Decision makers; Decision-making process; Hybrid storages; NoSQL system; RDBMS's; Relational Database; Storage architectures; Systems architecture; Traditional approaches; Decision support systems","","","","","","","International Journal of Computer and Information System Ijcis, (2020); Queiroz-Sousa, Paulo Orlando, A review on OLAP technologies applied to information networks, ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, 14, 1, (2019); J, (2019); International Journal of Knowledge Based Organizations, (2019); Int J Res Granthaalayah, (2019); Meier, Andreas, SQL & NoSQL Databases: Models, Languages, Consistency Options and Architectures for Big Data Management, SQL and NoSQL Databases: Models, Languages, Consistency Options and Architectures for Big Data Management, pp. 1-229, (2019); Siddiqa, Aisha, Big data storage technologies: a survey, Frontiers of Information Technology and Electronic Engineering, 18, 8, pp. 1040-1070, (2017); Bjeladinovic, Srdja, A fresh approach for hybrid SQL/NoSQL database design based on data structuredness, Enterprise Information Systems, 12, 8-9, pp. 1202-1220, (2018); Abbasi, Maryam, Nosql scalability performance evaluation over cassandra, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 111, pp. 512-520, (2019); Banerjee, Shreya, A unified conceptual model for data warehouses, Annals of Emerging Technologies in Computing, 5, Special issue 5, pp. 162-169, (2021)","L.

However, if proper data management concerns are not addressed, this massive data storage can easily turn Data Lakes into Data Swamps. Furthermore, data must be associated with the data artefacts created to extract value from it, such as pipelines used to collect, treat, or process data and analytical artefacts such as analytical dashboards and machine learning models. This paper proposes a more comprehensive view of a Data Lake, in which all of these resources can be stored and managed. To that end, the conceptual meta-model incorporates a data catalog, data at various stages of maturity, pipelines, dashboards, and machine learning models. The proposed meta-model was instantiated in the ADM.IN (Advanced Decision Making in Productive Systems through Intelligent Networks) project, showing how vast amounts of data and their related artefacts can be managed to support decision-making processes with data analytics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big Data Analytics; Data Lake; Productive Systems","Big data; Decision making; Digital storage; Information management; Lakes; Machine learning; Metadata; Pipelines; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Data artifacts; Data lake; Decisions makings; Formalisation; Machine learning models; Meta model; Metamodeling; Productive systems; Data Analytics","","","","","(055087, POCI-01-0247-FEDER-055087); (101070186); Australian Government; Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics, North Carolina State University, CDP, (881843); Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics, North Carolina State University, CDP; European Research Council, ERC, (20203FFYLK, 834228); European Research Council, ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (277991500, 432399058, 445156547); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (16-IDEX-0001); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; University of Wollongong, UOW; University of Adelaide; University of South Australia, UniSA; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/00319/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Generalitat Valenciana, GVA; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2020-117191RBI00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PROMETEO/2021/088); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; European Social Fund Plus, ESF; Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG; Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, MiSE, (F/160038/01-04/X41); Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, MiSE; Programa Operacional Temático Factores de Competitividade, POFC; Conselleria de Innovación, Universidades, Ciencia y Sociedad Digital, Generalitat Valenciana, CIUCSD","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements.

Failure to fully characterise the lead clone during initial screening can lead to lengthy project delays during scale-up, which can potentially compromise commercial manufacturing success. In this study, we propose a novel cell line development methodology, referenced as CLD<inf>4</inf>, which involves four steps enabling autonomous data-driven selection of the lead clone. The first step involves the digitalisation of the process and storage of all available information within a structured data lake. The second step calculates a new metric referenced as the cell line manufacturability index (MI<inf>CL</inf>) quantifying the performance of each clone by considering the selection criteria relevant to productivity, growth and product quality. The third step implements machine learning (ML) to identify any potential risks associated with process operation and relevant critical quality attributes (CQAs). The final step of CLD<inf>4</inf> takes into account the available metadata and summaries all relevant statistics generated in steps 1–3 in an automated report utilising a natural language generation (NLG) algorithm. The CLD<inf>4</inf> methodology was implemented to select the lead clone of a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line producing high levels of an antibody-peptide fusion with a known product quality issue related to end-point trisulfide bond (TSB) concentration. CLD<inf>4</inf> identified sub-optimal process conditions leading to increased levels of trisulfide bond that would not be identified through conventional cell line development methodologies.

The primary reason for that is the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has enabled uninterrupted sharing and exchange of data for its users from the consumer to the industrial level. Although still in the nascent stage of evolution, IoT has the potential to significantly impact business outcomes and will be instrumental in bringing a transformation in the way we communicate and exchange information. However, there remains a considerable gap in identifying the challenges in the implementation of IoT platforms and techniques. This paper aims at presenting a comprehensive analysis of the major challenges in the implementation of IoT and classifies them into two broad categories-technological and managerial according to the opinions of the experts. An attempt has been made herein to create a hierarchy depicting the key challenges where the researchers and industry should focus their attention and make better strategic decisions. A multi-criteria decision-making method known as the Best-Worst Method (BWM) has been used to rate the challenges. Results show that power requirement is the major challenge in technological challenges and maintenance is the major challenge in managerial challenges. © 2023 IEEE.","Best-Worst Method; Challenges in Implementation; Internet of Things; IoT","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; BAD methods; Best-bad method; Business outcomes; Challenge in implementation; Comprehensive analysis; Industrial datum; Machine-learning; Multiple source; Smart Development; Strategic decisions; Internet of things","","","","","","","Al-Qaseemi, Sarah A., IoT architecture challenges and issues: Lack of standardization, FTC 2016 - Proceedings of Future Technologies Conference, pp. 731-738, (2017); Three Major Challenges Facing Iot, (2017); Belli, Laura, IoT-enabled smart sustainable cities: Challenges and approaches, Smart Cities, 3, 3, pp. 1039-1071, (2020); Guo, Yinghao, Efficient and flexible management for industrial Internet of Things: A federated learning approach, Computer Networks, 192, (2021); Int J Comput Intell Res, (2017); Hussein, Abdel Rahman, Internet of Things (IOT): Research challenges and future applications, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 10, 6, pp. 77-82, (2019); Jain, Saurabh, Sustainable Infrastructure Theories and Models, Digital Cities Roadmap: IoT-Based Architecture and Sustainable Buildings, pp. 97-126, (2021); Anjum, Misbah, Assessment of software vulnerabilities using best-worst method and two-way analysis, International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences, 5, 2, pp. 328-342, (2020); Malhotra, Snigdha, Hierarchical framework for analysing the challenges of implementing industrial Internet of Things in manufacturing industries using ISM approach, International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management, 13, 5, pp. 2356-2370, (2022); Abdulkareem, Nasiba M., IoT and Cloud Computing Issues, Challenges and Opportunities: A Review, Qubahan Academic Journal, 1, 2, pp. 1-7, (2021)","M.

The solution to this problem is digital twins based on data lake technology implementation. The aim of the work is to create a prototype of an electronic passport (e-passport) of materials as the basis of their digital twin. The digital twin is to contain a set of data on the composition, structure, calculated and experimentally measured properties, participation in the composition of chemical reactions, constructed models and ""structure-property""patterns as well. It is proposed to combine the information on a specific material or compound into an information structure-electronic passports of the research object. At the same time, it is advisable to consider the electronic passport as a comprehensive description of the object, including information about the static and dynamic parameters of the atomic-molecular system of the research object. The e-passport as an information object gives a systematic data on the composition of a substance, structure, calculated and experimentally measured properties, the participation of elements in the composition of chemical reactions, constructed models and ""structure-property""patterns, thus acting as a generalizing tool convenient for users to present information available in the database of digital twins of materials. © 2023 IEEE.","big data; data lake; decision support system; digital twin; electronic passport; full-Text search","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Lakes; Search engines; Structure (composition); Data lake; Electronic passports; Full-text search; Measured properties; Object description; Property patterns; Research object; Structure property; System development; Technology implementation; Decision support systems","","","","","","","Ernst Young Global Limited, (2021); Glatt, Moritz F., Modeling and implementation of a digital twin of material flows based on physics simulation, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 58, pp. 231-245, (2021); Xiang, Feng, Digital twin driven green material optimal-selection towards sustainable manufacturing, Procedia CIRP, 81, pp. 1290-1294, (2019); 4th International Congress on 3D Material Science, (2018); Kalidindi, Surya R., Digital Twins for Materials, Frontiers in Materials, 9, (2022); Information Management Systems, (2015); Business Analytics from Data to Knowledge, (2013); Data Lake for Enterprises Lambda Architecture for Building Enterprise Data Systems, (2017); Itm Web Conf, (2018); Corporate Data Warehouses Planning Development Implementation, (2001)","D.

As the power marketing decision-making system involves more data, there are often some cases of incomplete data collection and incorrect data analysis results in the system, and through the advantages of resources in the era of big data, power companies can focus on developing power system integration, centralised management of resources and big data decision support. In the process of data integration, the power grid company has developed a large number of information systems, but still lacks some practical enterprise decision-making systems. The so-called enterprise decision-making system is a decision-making system that facilitates customer service, improves efficiency and saves labour costs. This paper uses data warehousing and data mining technology to propose the development and design of a power marketing decision support system based on data mining technology, and designs the business architecture, application architecture, data architecture and technical architecture based on the results of requirement analysis. Through practice, it is shown that the system has strong management, decision-making and query capabilities, fast response speed and relatively simple operation, which can provide comprehensive information support for high-level marketing decisions and improve enterprise competitiveness and economic benefits. © 2022 ACM.","Customer Service; Data Mining Technology; Enterprise Decision-Making; Power Marketing; System Optimization","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Competition; Computer architecture; Data acquisition; Data integration; Data mining; Data warehouses; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information management; Marketing; Search engines; 'current; Customer-service; Data mining technology; Decision-making systems; Electric power; Enterprise decision-making; Marketing decision; Optimization design; Power marketing; System optimizations; Big data","","","","","","","Qin, Yunfei, Implementation and design of basketball technical action based on B/S framework data mining system, Applied Mechanics and Materials, 380-384, pp. 2736-2740, (2013); Cheng, Wenyuan, Composite structure optimization design system based on grid technology, Key Engineering Materials, 334-335 I, pp. 453-456, (2007); Jiang, Li, Optimization design for a high voltage DC power supply module based on PSM technology, Plasma Science and Technology, 16, 4, pp. 424-428, (2014); Ge, Lianzheng, Optimization design of drive system for industrial robots based on dynamic performance, Industrial Robot, 44, 6, pp. 765-775, (2017); Li, Xinwang, The shift step optimization of belt conveyor in self-advancing semi-continuous mining technology based on SIMIO, World Journal of Engineering, 14, 4, pp. 324-328, (2017); Xue, Puning, Fault detection and operation optimization in district heating substations based on data mining techniques, Applied Energy, 205, pp. 926-940, (2017); Fei, Xianju, Research on data mining algorithm based on neural network and particle swarm optimization, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 35, 3, pp. 2921-2926, (2018); Circuits and Systems, (2012); Sun, Jiwen, Design for diagnosability of multistation manufacturing systems based on sensor allocation optimization, Computers in Industry, 60, 7, pp. 501-509, (2009); Gu, Qiang, Development of materials database system for cae system of heat treatment based on data mining technology, Transactions of Nonferrous Metals Society of China (English Edition), 16, SUPPL., pp. s572-s576, (2006)","M.

In this framework, artificial intelligence, GIS, geospatial analysis and space assets can play a crucial role. Social media analytics can be used to trigger Earth Observation (EO) satellite acquisitions over potential new areas of human aggregation. Similarly, EO satellites can be used jointly with social media analytics to systematically monitor well-known areas of aggregation (green urban areas, public markets, etc.). The information that can be obtained from the Earth Cognitive System 4 COVID-19 (ECO4CO) are both predictive, aiming to identify possible new clusters of outbreaks, and at the same time supervisorial, by monitoring infrastructures (i.e. traffic jams, parking lots) or specific categories (i.e. teenagers, doctors, teachers, etc.). In this perspective, the technologies described in this paper will allow us to detect critical areas where individuals can be involved in risky aggregation clusters. The ECO4CO data lake will be integrated with ad hoc data obtained by health care structures to understand trends and dynamics, to assess criticalities with respect to medical response and supplies, and to test possibilities useful to tackle potential future emergencies. The System will also provide geographical information on the spread of the infection which will allow an appropriate context-specific public health response to the epidemic.

Predictive models developed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and based on timely, centralized and standardized real world patient data could improve management of COVID-19 to achieve better clinical outcomes. The objectives of this manuscript are to describe the structure and technologies used to construct a COVID-19 Data Mart architecture and to present how a large hospital has tackled the challenge of supporting daily management of COVID-19 pandemic emergency, by creating a strong retrospective knowledge base, a real time environment and integrated information dashboard for daily practice and early identification of critical condition at patient level. This framework is also used as an informative, continuously enriched data lake, which is a base for several on-going predictive studies. Methods: The information technology framework for clinical practice and research was described. It was developed using SAS Institute software analytics tool and SAS® Vyia® environment and Open-Source environment R ® and Python ® for fast prototyping and modeling. The included variables and the source extraction procedures were presented. Results: The Data Mart covers a retrospective cohort of 5528 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. People who died were older, had more comorbidities, reported more frequently dyspnea at onset, had higher D-dimer, C-reactive protein and urea nitrogen. The dashboard was developed to support the management of COVID-19 patients at three levels: hospital, single ward and individual care level. Interpretation: The COVID-19 Data Mart based on integration of a large collection of clinical data and an AI-based integrated framework has been developed, based on a set of automated procedures for data mining and retrieval, transformation and integration, and has been embedded in the clinical practice to help managing daily care. Benefits from the availability of a Data Mart include the opportunity to build predictive models with a machine learning approach to identify undescribed clinical phenotypes and to foster hospital networks. A real-time updated dashboard built from the Data Mart may represent a valid tool for a better knowledge of epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19, especially when multiple waves are observed, as well as for epidemic and pandemic events of the same nature (e. g. with critical clinical conditions leading to severe pulmonary inflammation). Therefore, we believe the approach presented in this paper may find several applications in comparable situations even at region or state levels. Finally, models predicting the course of future waves or new pandemics could largely benefit from network of DataMarts. © 2022","","Behavioral research; Clinical research; Data integration; Data mining; Decision making; Diseases; Hospitals; Knowledge based systems; Metadata; Open source software; Open systems; Patient treatment; Python; SARS; Software prototyping; Centralised; Clinical decision making; Clinical practices; Data mart; Healthcare systems; Integrated frameworks; Patient data; Predictive models; Real- time; Real-world; Hospital data processing; C reactive protein; D dimer; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical decision making; clinical feature; clinical practice; clinical research; cohort analysis; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; data integration; data mining; data warehouse; dyspnea; embedding; epidemic; female; human; information retrieval; information technology; knowledge base; machine learning; major clinical study; male; pandemic; phenotype; retrospective study; urea nitrogen blood level; ward; epidemiology; Artificial Intelligence; Clinical Decision-Making; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4","","","Society for Anthropological Sciences, SAS","We are grateful to all the healthcare workers of SITRA (Servizio Infermieristico, Tecnico e Riabilitativo Aziendale del Policlinico Gemelli).

In conjunction with machine learning, farmers can use data to address problems such as farmers’ decision making, water management, soil management, crop management, and livestock management. Crop management includes yield prediction, disease detection, weed detection, crop quality, and species recognition. On the other hand, livestock management considers animal welfare and livestock production. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the evidence regarding the challenges involved in implementing machine learning in agricultural Big Data. We conducted a systematic literature review applying the PRISMA protocol. This review includes 30 papers published from 2015 to 2020. We develop a framework that summarizes the main challenges encountered, machine learning techniques, and the leading technologies used. A significant challenge is the design of agricultural Big Data architectures due to the need to modify the set of technologies adapting the machine learning techniques as the volume of data increases. © 2022 by the authors.

The pipeline has two main objectives: to provide a consistent workflow of activities to be applied to the incoming data, aiming at extracting useful information for the ministry’s decision making tasks, and to homogenize the incoming data, so that they can be stored in a centralized and coherent data lake to be used as a reference for further analysis and considerations. © © 2022, IGI Global.","Big Data Representation; Data Lake; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Privacy Preservation","Decision making; Deep learning; Lakes; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Pipelines; Semantics; Big data representation; Data lake; Data pipelines; Data representations; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Privacy preservation; Semantic representation; Big data","","","","","","The study described in this work was performed and co-funded as a part of the research activities of the Applied Research Project”Big data Giustizia e Datawarehouse” promoted by the Italian Ministry of Justice and realized by Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale per l’Informatica (CINI).","Najafabadi, Maryam M., Deep learning applications and challenges in big data analytics, Journal of Big Data, 2, 1, (2015); Italy Goes to Stanford A Collection of Corenlp Modules for Italian, (2016); Chianese, Angelo, An Associative Engines Based Approach Supporting Collaborative Analytics in the Internet of Cultural Things, Proceedings - 2015 10th International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing, 3PGCIC 2015, pp. 533-538, (2015); Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, (2017); Bouraoui, Zied, Inducing relational knowledge from BERT, AAAI 2020 - 34th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 7456-7463, (2020); Dai, Jason Jinquan, BigDL: A Distributed Deep Learning Framework for Big Data, SoCC 2019 - Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing, pp. 50-60, (2019); Int J Big Data Intell, (2021); Di Martino, Beniamino D.I., A machine learning based methodology for automatic annotation and anonymisation of privacy-related items in textual documents for justice domain, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1194 AISC, pp. 530-539, (2021); Fang, Huang, Managing data lakes in big data era: What's a data lake and why has it became popular in data management ecosystem, 2015 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control and Intelligent Systems, IEEE-CYBER 2015, pp. 820-824, (2015); Spacy 2 Natural Language Understanding with Bloom Embeddings Convolutional Neural Networks and Incremental Parsing, (2017)","","","IGI Global","","","","","","19380259","","","","English","Int.

Specifically, as such models tend to include and rely on detailed representations of systems, components, and tools with complex interactions, mechanisms for simplifying, integrating, and scaling management capabilities in the presence of complex data requirements (e.g., high volume, velocity, and diversity of data) are of particular interest. A data fabric is a system that provides a unified architecture for management and provisioning of data. In this work we present the background, design requirements, and high-level outline of the ASSISTANT data fabric - a flexible data management tool designed for use in adaptive manufacturing contexts. The paper outlines the implementation of the system with specific focus on the use of domain models and the data modeling approach used, as well as provides a generic use case structure reusable in many industrial contexts. © 2022 The Authors.

BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture.

Smart energy grids, pervasive computing and communication technologies have enabled the stakeholders in the energy industry to collect large amounts of useful and highly granular energy data. They are generated in large volumes and in a variety of different formats, depending on their originating systems and prospected purposes. Moreover, the data type can be structured and unstructured, in open or proprietary formats. This work focuses on harnessing the power of Big Data Management to propose a first model of an Italian Energy Data Lake: the goal is to create a repository of national energy data that respects the FAIRness' key principles [1], aimed at providing a decision support system and the availability of FAIR data for open science.

Considering how the manufacturing sector is adopting data-driven operations is challenging, given that there is not a straightforward definition of machine traceability, receiving and storing raw data from manufacturing lines, gives an opportunity to analyse the processes in real time nature. Thanks to big data management platforms and artificial intelligence decision support algorithms, it gives the ability to deeply understand the complexity of the processes and, accordingly, to eliminate or minimise false methods and reduce the costs that are insufficient for production. In addition, one of the biggest preventable costs for metal machining processes is the tool breakage and tool wearing problems. The motivation of this paper is to discuss data-driven decision making possibilities of the tool wearing and optimise breakage costs with using artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the analysis provides a proof-of-concept that the existence of a digital infrastructure combined with the analytical capabilities, such as real-time data management and monitoring, and having a highly accurate LSTM based time-series integrated artificial intelligent predictive model, to deal with inefficiencies in production processes. To this end, in this context, by developing the latest advancements in big data analytics, we propose a scalable predictive and preventive maintenance architecture for metal machining processes domain.

This paper systematically summarizes and analyzes the application status of artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest, case-based reasoning (CBR)and other machine algorithms inlost circulation feature prediction, real-time monitoring of lost circulation and application decision-making model. Additionally, a comparison is made on the input parameters, output parameters, test accuracy, and application effects of various machine learning algorithms. On this basis, it has been found that machine learning algorithms tend to have good application prospects in thief zone location prediction, lost circulation monitoring and early warning, and recommendation of measures for preventing and plugging lost circulation. Compared with artificial statistical analysis, the machine learning algorithms have obvious advantages in timeliness, accuracy and large-scale application. However, it is still unable for us to conduct scientific prediction and calculation of the loss pressure, pore/fracture size and other key parameters of lost circulation features and to optimize the field construction using these algorithms. As we know, foreign oil and gas companies made an early start for the overall arrangement of digital drilling and completion technology. At present, they have developed the software for lost circulation prevention and plugging by integrating a variety of machine learning algorithms, and have achieved certain application results in the field. However, China started late in the management of data related to lost circulation prevention and plugging, the development of machine learning algorithms and the research of bundled software, and it has not yet established any mature, reliable digital platform and intelligent expert system for lost circulation prevention and plugging. In order to accelerate the digital and intelligent transformation development of lost circulation technology in China, the research should focus onthe following three aspects:(1)to promote the integration of multi-dimensional data related to lost circulation, build a data lake involving earthquake, logging, drilling, laboratory evaluation and field construction of lost circulation, and make up and improvethe shortcomings of data; (2)to strengthen the explanatory study on machine learning algorithm model, and improve the scientificity and accuracy of the algorithm model based on the mechanisms of lost circulation; (3)to integrate the lost circulation data lake and algorithm modules, establish an intelligent expert system for the intelligent prediction and early warning as well as assistant decision-making of lost circulation in different regions, and formulate fine operation standards for lost circulation prevention and plugging, so as to comprehensively improve the one-time success rate of fd lost circulation control. © 2022, Editorial Office of ACTA PETROLEI SINICA.

With enormous amounts of information originating in sources with uncertain degree of validation and accuracy, it is essential to provide executive-level decision-makers with the most actionable, pertinent, and updated data analysis to enable them to adapt their strategy swiftly and competently. Objective: We report here the origination of a COVID-19 dedicated response in the Israel Defense Forces with the assembly of an operational Data Center for the Campaign against Coronavirus. Methods: Spearheaded by directors with clinical, operational, and data analytics orientation, a multidisciplinary team utilized existing and newly developed platforms to collect and analyze large amounts of information on an individual level in the context of SARS-CoV-2 contraction and infection. Results: Nearly 300,000 responses to daily questionnaires were recorded and were merged with other data sets to form a unified data lake. By using basic as well as advanced analytic tools ranging from simple aggregation and display of trends to data science application, we provided commanders and clinicians with access to trusted, accurate, and personalized information and tools that were designed to foster operational changes and mitigate the propagation of the pandemic. The developed tools aided in the in the identification of high-risk individuals for severe disease and resulted in a 30% decline in their attendance to their units. Moreover, the queue for laboratory examination for COVID-19 was optimized using a predictive model and resulted in a high true-positive rate of 20%, which is more than twice as high as the baseline rate (2.28%, 95% CI 1.63%-3.19%).Conclusions: In times of ambiguity and uncertainty, along with an unprecedented flux of information, health organizations may find multidisciplinary teams working to provide intelligence from diverse and rich data a key factor in providing executives relevant and actionable support for decision-making. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

If one coordinates the enormous availability of data, which creates the data assets of public administration, with the analysis power of AI systems, predictability of public decision would be the outcome, on the basis of the historical patrimony, which forms the data lake, of the administration itself. In this way, the technical standard created by the use of the algorithm will make it possible, for example, to free public employees from the most alienating jobs, leaving to human intelligence the correction of errors and the control of standards, and to artificial intelligence the detection (or revelation) of inconsistencies and inefficiencies. The results of AI-based analyses provide the ground for public agencies to redefine their standards of administration according to their levels of capacity and suitability derived from data processing. The research ends with a reflection on the concrete opportunity to reform provided by AI; a real digital revolution of public administration with which derives a new way of administration, i.e. by algorithms, which requires a review of certain principles of public administration, starting with the unaccountability of the political decisions' matters. © 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

During an operational campaign, the Health Monitoring System (HMS) also allows an understanding of how component degradation is affecting the performance of the equipment. Through a structure supported by AI, as data lake and cloud computing, the HMS provides to monitored equipment a fault detection system, early warning alarms to prevent failures and a calculation of the remaining useful life (RUL).The purpose of this paper is to present a prognosis smart system based on AI applied to HMS to support decision-making regarding operational performance of equipment. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) procedure is developed to continuously analyze the mass of monitoring data generated during the machine operation. The ability to learn the behavior patterns of the collected signals and in this way to be able to make parameter predictions with high accuracy makes artificial neural networks a powerful tool to carry out an effective prognosis. Machine operational parameters are monitored simultaneously by the prognosis smart system. Then, this information is processed by the neural network and used to characterize the machine operational condition. Upon detecting a failure trend for one or more parameters monitored by recognizing deterioration patterns, the prognosis system calculates the remaining useful life (RUL) and allows maintainers to take early actions before the failure occurrence.The proposed methodology is applied as part of a HMS of a hydro generator based on parameters registered in operator inspections routes designed to identify critical equipment degradation. The registered data representing one operational year are used to train the neural network regarding normal and abnormal machine condition. After training, the neural network is able to predict failure trends for monitored temperature parameters of the hydro-generator lubricating system that is critical to support equipment performance. Comparing prediction data and data collected by the sensors, the developed neural network reached about 0,98 RMSE score. The remaining useful life prognosis proved to be an important tool to avoid hydro generator components unexpected failures which may affect power output and cause penalties to the power generation company. © 2021 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; health monitoring; remaining useful life; smart prognosis","Cloud computing; Data mining; Fault detection; Forecasting; Health; Hydroelectric generators; Lakes; Outages; Recurrent neural networks; Cloud-computing; Health monitoring; Health monitoring system; Hydro-generators; Informed decision; Neural-networks; Remaining useful lives; Smart manufacturing; Smart prognose; Smart System; Decision making","","","","","","","Wu, Szejung, A neural network integrated decision support system for condition-based optimal predictive maintenance policy, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A:Systems and Humans, 37, 2, pp. 226-236, (2007); Nadai, Nicolas, Equipment failure prediction based on neural network analysis incorporating maintainers inspection findings, Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, (2017); Si, Xiaosheng, Remaining useful life estimation - A review on the statistical data driven approaches, European Journal of Operational Research, 213, 1, pp. 1-14, (2011); Gebraeel, Nagi Z., Residual-life distributions from component degradation signals: A Bayesian approach, IIE Transactions (Institute of Industrial Engineers), 37, 6, pp. 543-557, (2005); Dinardo, Giuseppe, A smart and intuitive machine condition monitoring in the Industry 4.0 scenario, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 126, pp. 1-12, (2018); Gao, Dong, A Novel Indirect Health Indicator Extraction Based on Charging Data for Lithium-Ion Batteries Remaining Useful Life Prognostics, SAE International Journal of Alternative Powertrains, 6, 2, pp. 183-193, (2017); Pereira, Fábio Henrique, Nonlinear autoregressive neural network models for prediction of transformer oil-dissolved gas concentrations, Energies, 11, 7, (2018); Wan, Jiafu, Context-aware cloud robotics for material handling in cognitive industrial Internet of Things, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5, 4, pp. 2272-2281, (2018); Ahmed, Ejaz, The role of big data analytics in Internet of Things, Computer Networks, 129, pp. 459-471, (2017); Yan, Hehua, Industrial Big Data Analytics for Prediction of Remaining Useful Life Based on Deep Learning, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 17190-17197, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE","67th Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, RAMS 2021","2021-05-24 through 2021-05-27","Orlando","174610","0149144X","9781424425099; 9781665460538; 0780317866; 9798350307696; 9781728136899; 9781728180175; 9781457718496; 9781538628706; 1424400074; 9781424400072","","","English","Proc.

In this framework, artificial intelligence, GIS, geospatial analysis and space assets can play a crucial role. Social media analytics can be used to trigger Earth Observation (EO) satellite acquisitions over potential new areas of human aggregation. Similarly, EO satellites can be used jointly with social media analytics to systematically monitor well-known areas of aggregation (green urban areas, public markets, etc.). The information that can be obtained from the Earth Cognitive System 4 COVID-19 (ECO4CO) are both predictive, aiming to identify possible new clusters of outbreaks, and at the same time supervisorial, by monitoring infrastructures (i.e. traffic jams, parking lots) or specific categories (i.e. teenagers, doctors, teachers, etc.). In this perspective, the technologies described in this paper will allow us to detect critical areas where individuals can be involved in risky aggregation clusters. The ECO4CO data lake will be integrated with ad hoc data obtained by sanitary structures to understand trends and dynamics, to assess criticalities with respect to medical response and supplies, and to test possibilities useful to tackle potential future emergencies. The System will also provide geographical information on the spread of the infection which will allow an appropriate context-specific public health response to the epidemic. This project is being co-funded by the European Space Agency under its Business Applications programme. In the present study, the ECO4CO space asset-based system aims to reply to the emergency of the actual pandemic through the following pillars: • Cluster Area Identification: a predictive data analytics service using social media and news to automatically identify possible new outbreaks areas; • Intelligent Satellite Tasking: an autonomous system able to task EO satellites data acquisitions; • Object Detection: a deep learning service able to identify objects and people gathering or movements from images and videos; • Tracking: an intelligent service able to track traffic and people movement, identifying suspect patterns or anomalies; • Logistic Planning: a predictive data analytics service to identify region color classification, hospitalization and stock of medical centers and match them against future needs of medical supplies. © © 2021 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Where many AI processes are technologies hidden from view of the citizen, how can public institutions support and ensure these high levels of trust, transparency, and openness in Nordic culture and extend these concepts of “digital trust” to AI? One solution is by authoring national policy that upholds cultural values and personal rights, ultimately reinforcing these values in their societies. The paper highlights differences in how Nordic nations position themselves using cultural values as organizing principles, with the author showing these values (i.e., trust through clear information and information security, transparency through AI literacy education and clear algorithmic decision making, and openness by creating data lakes and data trusts) support the development of AI technology in society. The analysis shows that three cultural values are upheld and influence Nordic national AI strategies, while themes of privacy, ethics, and autonomy are present, and democracy, a societal building block in the Nordics, is especially prominent in the policies. For policy development, policy leaders must understand that without citizen involvement in AI implementation or lacking citizen AI education, we risk alienating those for who these services are meant to utilize and improve access for. © 2020 The Author","Artificial Intelligence policy; Cultural values; Digital trust; Openness; Technology policy; Transparency","Decision making; Privacy by design; Public policy; Transparency; Citizen involvement; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; National policies; Policy development; Policy documents; Policy strategies; Public institution; Textual analysis; Artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence; autonomy; culture; ethics; policy development; technology policy; Norway","","","","","","","As We May Think, (1945); Mind, (1950); Artificial Intelligence how to Get It Right Putting Policy into Practice for Safe Data Driven Innovation in Health and Care, (2019); Wired, (2018); European Parliamentary Research Service, (2019); Like A God Google A I Beats Human Champ of Notoriously Complex Go Game, (2017); Benefits and Risks of Artificial Intelligence, (2018); undefined, (2018); Harnessing the Economic Benefits of Artificial Intelligence, (2017); Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Universities Heres how, (2017)","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","0160791X","","","","English","Technol.

An electronic health record (EHR)-integrated machine learning (ML) algorithm is a potentially powerful tool to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of CDS alerts and positively impact the clinician's interaction with these alerts in general. Objective: This study aimed to describe the development and implementation of an ML-based signal-to-noise optimization system (SmartCDS) to increase the signal of alerts by decreasing the volume of low-value herpes zoster (shingles) vaccination alerts. Methods: We built and deployed SmartCDS, which builds personalized user activity profiles to suppress shingles vaccination alerts unlikely to yield a clinician's interaction. We extracted all records of shingles alerts from January 2017 to March 2019 from our EHR system, including 327,737 encounters, 780 providers, and 144,438 patients. Results: During the 6 weeks of pilot deployment, the SmartCDS system suppressed an average of 43.67% (15,425/35,315) potential shingles alerts (appointments) and maintained stable counts of weekly shingles vaccination orders (326.3 with system active vs 331.3 in the control group; P=.38) and weekly user-alert interactions (1118.3 with system active vs 1166.3 in the control group; P=.20). Conclusions: All key statistics remained stable while the system was turned on. Although the results are promising, the characteristics of the system can be subject to future data shifts, which require automated logging and monitoring. We demonstrated that an automated, ML-based method and data architecture to suppress alerts are feasible without detriment to overall order rates. This work is the first alert suppression ML-based model deployed in practice and serves as foundational work in encounter-level customization of alert display to maximize effectiveness. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

With no control over the feed stock and finished material pricing, which are mostly governed by regulations, operators must look with in their Operation & Maintenance (O&M) for possible areas of optimization. In modern days, CIOs are greatly empowered to drive Digital Transformation strategy and contribute in improved profitability. Many of such initiatives fail to deliver the desired outcomes in timely manner. This paper discusses the essential elements of EDGE analytics embedding the fundamental aspects of plant O&M in such Digital Transformation initiatives, and thus enabling faster value realization of the investment. Methods, Procedures, Process: Every industry can be looked in to three different tiers as Assets, Process & systems and Business. Each of them has different outcomes to contribute in overall profitability. Moreover, technology, methodology, people and their collaborative adoption play a big role in achieving those outcomes. Asset performance is evaluated using KPIs like availability, reliability, cost & Safety. Process involves interaction of people & process fluids with those assets. However, the fundaments remain same as the source of information, based on which the O&M decisions are taken. Transducers & measurements around plant assets are the single biggest source of information for such decision making. Often, this information is not best utilized in terms of generating proactive insights. Information from these measurements can be converted into simple analytics. E.g. Proximity type vibration transducer measures vibration amplitude which is used for equipment safe operation and shutdown when exceed the defined threshold. Same transducer also provides the gap voltage and spectral data. Analytics definition using proximity probe gap voltage will identify rotor position within the bearing and then comparing it across the machine train along with orbit preload can give significant information about rotor dynamics. Such analytics available at EDGE are often overlooked in enterprise level predictive analytics deployed by Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning. One of the reasons for it is cyber security concern for the data exchange across IT-OT network layers. This paper talks about implementing comprehensive strategy utilizing the information from EDGE devices for EDGE analytics, various challenges and possible way forward in complying to cyber security requirements for data exchange from OT-IT systems and thus enhancing value of big data in Data Lakes. Results, Observations, Conclusions: EDGE analytics adds immense value for assets in achieving best of performance KPIs. With increased adoption of cyber security practices in plant operations, there are many IT approved architectures exist today to share these analytics insight to L4 - business network. With focus on industry domain experience around systems of systems and progressive thinking, EDGE analytics will play inevitable role in the overall success of O&G 4.0 in coming years. Novel/Additive Information: ""Data is the new oil"". Corporates in energy sectors are driving forth industrial revolution with this belief and investing heavily in big data-based projects. Asset condition monitoring systems at EDGE in OT domain remains in silos. High resolution static & dynamic data in various operating modes collected in these Condition monitoring systems hasn't been historically much interfaced with such big data projects. Use cases of such interfaces with static & dynamic data, benefits, related workflow, data exchange architecture is relatively newer in the industry. Comprehensive discussion of these aspects in this paper will enable industries to realize faster outcomes. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers","","Behavioral research; Costs; Cybersecurity; Decision making; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Investments; Network layers; Network security; Predictive analytics; Condition monitoring systems; Cyber security; Digital transformation; Dynamic data; Gap voltage; Operations maintenance; Performance; Sources of informations; Static datum; Static dynamics; Profitability","","","","","","","undefined; Iso 14224 Kpis Related to Reliability and Maintenance of Industrial Assets","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers","","Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020","2020-11-09 through 2020-11-12","Abu Dhabi","165204","","9781613997345","","","English","Soc.

Although the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have been evolved separately, they are closely intertwined. Indeed, the role of big data in IoT is tremendous as IoT is projected to include billions of connected devices, producing a massive amounts of data within a few years. In this context, big data analytics is a key enabler for unlocking the untapped potential of the IoT and fueling a wide range of data-driven products, services, and business processes. Apache Hadoop is the most prominent and used tool in big data. Hadoop is an open source framework that enables distributed processing of large data sets across commodity clusters. It is designed to scale with built-in high availability and reliability. Additional open source projects have been built around the original Hadoop implementation with the addition of Apache Spark. Spark is the next hype in the industry among the big data tools which was designed to address the shortcomings of Hadoop. Spark provides primitives for in-memory cluster computing which can speed jobs that run on the Hadoop data processing platform. This chapter discusses the details of top Big Data processing frameworks being used today enabling automatic and scalable insight discovery from large and complex data.

Organizations are trying more than ever to accent their efforts on industrial development of all data at their disposal and move further away from underpinning technologies. After investing around Data Lake concept, organizations must now overhaul their data architecture to face IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) expansion. Efficient and effective data mapping treatments could serve in understanding the importance of data being transformed and used for decision-making process endorsement. As current relational databases are not able to manage large amounts of data, organizations headed towards NoSQL (Not only Structured Query Language) databases. One such known NoSQL database is MongoDB, which has a high scalability. This article mainly put forward a new data model able to extract, classify, and then map data for the purpose of generating new more structured data that meet organizational needs. This can be carried out by calculating various metadata attributes weights, which are considered as important information. It also processed on data clustering stored into MongoDB.

This data comes in various forms and formats which surpass the data management, integration and analysis capabilities of existing project intelligence tools used within the industry. Several tasks in the project lifecycle bear implications for the efficient planning and delivery of construction projects. Setting up right profit margins and its continuous tracking as projects progress are vital management tasks that require data-driven decision support. Existing profit estimation measures use a company or industry wide benchmarks to guide these decisions. These benchmarks are oftentimes unreliable as they do not factor in project-specific variations. As a result, projects are wrongly estimated using uniform rates that eventually end up with entirely unusual margins either due to underspends or overruns. This study proposed a project analytics approach where Big Data is harnessed to understand the profitability distribution of different types of construction projects. To this end, Big Data architecture is recommended, and a prototype implementation is shown to store and analyse large amounts of projects data. Our data analysis revealed that profit margins evolve, and the profitability performance varies across several project attributes. These insights shall be incorporated as knowledge to machine learning algorithms to predict project margins accurately. The proposed approach enabled the fast exploration of data to understand the underlying pattern in the profitability performance for different types of construction projects. © 2019 The Authors","Big data; Machine learning; Profitability performance; Project analytics; System architecture","Big data; Construction industry; Decision support systems; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Life cycle; Machine learning; Profitability; Analysis capabilities; Construction projects; Continuous tracking; Data architectures; Data driven decision; Project analytics; Prototype implementations; System architectures; Project management","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Innovate UK, (102473, 54832–413479); Innovate UK; (EP/S031480/1)","The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to Innovate UK through grant application number 54832\u2013413479 ; file number 102473 and Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) through grant reference number EP/S031480/1 for providing financial support to carryout this study.","Rui, Zhenghua, Investigation into the performance of oil and gas projects, Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering, 38, pp. 12-20, (2017); Luu, Van Truong, Improving project management performance of large contractors using benchmarking approach, International Journal of Project Management, 26, 7, pp. 758-769, (2008); Kumar, Ashok, Integrating quality function deployment and benchmarking to achieve greater profitability, Benchmarking, 13, 3, pp. 290-310, (2006); Jacobs, Adam, The pathologies of big data, Communications of the ACM, 52, 8, pp. 36-44, (2009); Singh, Dilpreet, A survey on platforms for big data analytics, Journal of Big Data, 2, 1, (2015); Mckinsey Quarterly, (2010); Diebold, Francis X., “Big data” dynamic factor models for macroeconomic measurement and forecasting: A discussion of the papers by Lucrezia Reichlin and by Mark W.

D2D communication technique is an optimized method to support various demands on massive data transfer rates among the users in 5G networks. Massive MIMO (Multiple-input and Multiple-output) based antenna systems are deployed to achieve these huge data demands in 5G technology. However, the drawbacks owing to expanding computational overhead in methods of allocating resource, reducing interference, energy optimization and several other problems in D2D networks are compromised with the help of emerging technology of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Furthermore, a novel approach based on AI is implemented with an Architectural design for D2D network in decision making over the implementation of techniques based on the persisting situation in the D2D network.

Organizational decisions, artificial intelligence, machine learning, time critical processes, analytics, etc. are driven by highly profiled data. Data gives an organization the ability to act in a corresponding situation and hence, keep up with the market. Financial returns are directly associated with the quality of data being used. Today's world has experienced a data explosion with the advent of data sources like Hadoop, data lakes, clusters and many more. Even more, the day to day devices that we use collect data to present meaningful statistics to us. There is an exponential increase in data volumes which are characterized by heterogeneous data formats and disparate data sources which in turn is complicating the task of providing uniform and profiled data to the business users for analysis. Warehousing is also not able to cope up with the on-demand real-time data access. Holistic view of the entire data is extremely difficult to achieve and takes a considerable amount of time which is slowing down an organization's decision making capabilities. The complexity of the current systems has increased due to the interconnected nature of widely distributed systems which share data. Dirty data i.e. data which is inaccurate, inconsistent, unclean or incomplete is spread all across. As all the data is unrequired garbage data, there is no point in developing your business intelligence over this data. Data Clarity used along with Data Virtualization provides an exceptional solution to these problems by handling the complex data workloads with respect to heterogeneous data and disparate data sources and provides a holistic view of the data to the business organization. © 2019 IEEE.","Active clusters; Data Clarity; Data Intelligence; Data life-cycle management; Data Virtualization; disparate data sources; Extensible Style sheet Language Transformations; Extraction; Federated Query Engine; metadata management; Transformation and Loading","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Virtualization; Business organizations; Data virtualization; Distributed systems; Exponential increase; Financial returns; Heterogeneous data; Quality of data; Real time data access; Data handling","","","","","","","Fiore, Sandro Luigi, Data virtualization in grid environments through the GRelC Data Access and Integration Service, International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, ICITST 2009, (2009); Mousa, Ayad Hameed, Data Warehouse and Data Virtualization Comparative Study, Proceedings - 2015 International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering, DeSE 2015, pp. 369-372, (2016); Earley, Seth, Data Virtualization and Digital Agility, IT Professional, 18, 5, pp. 70-72, (2016); Data Cleaning A Practical Perspective, (2013); Pan, Bin, Design and realization of an ETL method in business intelligence project, 2018 3rd IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis, ICCCBDA 2018, pp. 275-279, (2018); Hamad, Murtadha Mohammad, An enhanced technique to clean data in the data warehouse, Proceedings - 4th International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering, DeSE 2011, pp. 306-311, (2011)","O.V.

However, existing works on metadata management in data lakes mainly focus on structured and semi-structured data, with little research on unstructured data.

This trend addresses the important problem of chronic illnesses, highlighted by multiple international organizations as a core issue in future healthcare. Despite the myriad of exciting new developments, each application and system is designed and implemented for specific purposes and lacks the flexibility to support different healthcare concerns. Some of the known problems of such developments are the integration issues between applications and existing healthcare systems, the reusability of technical knowledge in the creation of new and more sophisticated systems and the usage of data gathered from multiple sources in the generation of new knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for the development of chronic disease support systems and applications as an answer to these shortcomings. Through this framework our pursuit is to create a common ground methodology upon which new developments can be created and easily integrated to provide better support to chronic patients, medical staff and other relevant participants. General requirements are inferred for any support system from the primary attention process of chronic patients by the Business Process Management Notation. Numerous technical approaches are proposed to design a general architecture that considers the medical organizational requirements in the treatment of a patient. A framework is presented for any application in support of chronic patients and evaluated by a case study to test the applicability and pertinence of the solution. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Chronic disease management; Clinical decision support systems (CDSS); Data architecture; Interoperability; Ubiquitous computing; Ubiquitous health (u-health) services","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Diseases; Enterprise resource management; Interoperability; Ontology; Patient treatment; Reusability; Ubiquitous computing; Advanced applications; Business process management notation; Chronic disease management; Clinical decision support systems; Data architectures; General architectures; International organizations; U healths; Information management; Article; chronic patient; clinical decision support system; health care management; health service; human; information dissemination; information system; Internet; long term care; medical staff; medical technology; odontology; ontology; priority journal; telehealth; treatment planning; artificial intelligence; chronic disease; computer graphics; decision making; hospitalization; information retrieval; medical informatics; nonbiological model; procedures; semantics; telemedicine; vital sign; Artificial Intelligence; Chronic Disease; Computer Graphics; Decision Making; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Hospitalization; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Medical Informatics; Models, Organizational; Semantics; Telemedicine; Vital Signs","","","","","","","undefined; Sambamoorthi, Usha, Multiple chronic conditions and healthcare costs among adults, Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, 15, 5, pp. 823-832, (2015); undefined; undefined, (2013); McPhail, Steven M., Multimorbidity in chronic disease: Impact on health care resources and costs, Risk Management and Healthcare Policy, 9, pp. 143-156, (2016); Leecaster, Molly K., Translation of Contextual Control Model to chronic disease management: A paradigm to guide design of cognitive support systems, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 71, pp. S60-S67, (2017); Paganelli, Federica, An ontology-based system for context-aware and configurable services to support home-based continuous care, IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine, 15, 2, pp. 324-333, (2011); Librelotto, Giovani Rubert, Architecture of central monitoring for pervasive homecare systems, Proceedings of the 2014 Latin American Computing Conference, CLEI 2014, (2014); Zhang, Yifan, An ontology-based approach to patient follow-up assessment for continuous and personalized chronic disease management, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 72, pp. 45-59, (2017); Agent Technology and E Health, (2008)","A.

The abundance of raw data necessitates the use of data analytics in order to extract useful patterns for decision making. Current architectures for big data analytics in the IoT domain address the large volume and velocity of the produced data. However, they do not address the semantic heterogeneity in the data models used by diverse IoT platforms, which emerges when large-scale deployments, spanning across multiple deployment sites, are considered. This paper proposes an architecture for big data analytics in the context of large-scale IoT systems consisting of multiple IoT platforms. A Semantic Interoperability Layer (SIL) handles the inter-operability among the data models of the individual platforms, using semantic mappings between them and a unified ontology. Data queries to the SIL and result collection is handled by a cloud-based data management layer, namely the Data Lake, along with storage of metadata needed by data analytics methods. Based on this infrastructure, web-based data analytics and visual analytics methods are used to analyze the collected data, while being agnostic of platform-specific details. The proposed architecture is developed in the context of healthcare provision for older people, although it can be applied to any IoT domain. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018 Published by Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

This last aspect depends strongly from right therapy prescriptions, especially when there are various opportunities. Within this context, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) could bring several benefits. In this paper, we propose a CDSS with the aim of improving the clinician practice based on recommendations, assessment of the patient and screening of patients with risk factors to prevent chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) complications. The proposed CDSS is implemented in the Nu.Sa. cloud system, which involves thousands of Italian General Practitioners (GPs) collecting data (EHR data, personal data, patient's medical history) from millions of patients. The proposed architecture is designed to collect data from a distributed scenario where GPs are collecting clinical history and pharmacy or second level hospitals gather data from medical devices connected to the cloud over a standard data architecture. We show that exploiting the integration of the medical device VenoScreen Plus with the patient EHR, this CDSS is capable to improve preventive care, to enhance clinical performance, to influence clinical decision making and to significantly improve the decision quality levering on data driven approach. © Copyright 2017 ASME.","","Artificial intelligence; Biomedical equipment; Data acquisition; Decision making; Design; Diagnosis; Embedded systems; Risk assessment; Chronic venous insufficiencies; Clinical application; Clinical decision making; Clinical decision support systems; Clinical performance; Data-driven approach; General practitioners; Proposed architectures; Decision support systems","","","","","","","Clinical Decision Support Systems Theory and Practice, (2007); Garg, Amit X., Effects of computerized clinical decision support systems on practitioner performance and patient outcomes: A systematic review, Journal of the American Medical Association, 293, 10, pp. 1223-1238, (2005); Kawamoto, Kensaku, Improving clinical practice using clinical decision support systems: A systematic review of trials to identify features critical to success, British Medical Journal, 330, 7494, pp. 765-768, (2005); Jamal, Aziz, The impact of health information technology on the quality of medical and health care: A systematic review, Health Information Management Journal, 38, 3, pp. 26-37, (2009); Karami, Mahtab, Clinical Decision Support Systems and Medical Imaging, Radiology management, 37, 2, pp. 4-25, (2015); Kukar, Matjaž Ž., Modern parameterization and explanation techniques in diagnostic decision support system: A case study in diagnostics of coronary artery disease, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 52, 2, pp. 77-90, (2011); Riggio, Jeffrey M., Effectiveness of a clinical decision support system to identify heparin induced thrombocytopenia, Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis, 28, 2, pp. 124-131, (2009); Field, Terry S., Costs Associated with Developing and Implementing a Computerized Clinical Decision Support System for Medication Dosing for Patients with Renal Insufficiency in the Long-term Care Setting, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 15, 4, pp. 466-472, (2008); Niès, Julie, Effects of automated alerts on unnecessarily repeated serology tests in a cardiovascular surgery department: A time series analysis, BMC Health Services Research, 10, (2010); Campion, Thomas R., Effects of blood glucose transcription mismatches on a computer-based intensive insulin therapy protocol, Intensive Care Medicine, 36, 9, pp. 1566-1570, (2010)","","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) infocentral@asme.org","Computers and Information in Engineering Division; Design Engineering Division","ASME 2017 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, IDETC/CIE 2017","2017-08-06 through 2017-08-09","Cleveland","131761","","9780791850206; 9780791850183; 9780791850190; 9780791858233; 9780791857168; 9780791858240","","","English","Proc.

First, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are usually applied to represent and reason about existing clinical knowledge, but also to discover new one from raw data. Second, at a global decision level, representative applications of Business Intelligence (BI) must be also considered. The present work introduces the design and implementation of a CDSS platform that integrates both AI and BI technologies to assist clinicians in the rational use of antibiotics in a hospital. The choice of a Hadoop based Big Data architecture provides a suitable solution for the problem of integrating, processing and analysing large sets of clinical data. The platform facilitates the daily follow-up of antibiotic therapies and infections while offering various decision support modules at both patient and global level.

In 2012, we conducted a focused environmental scan and informal interviews with fifteen experts to anticipate how PHC might impact health Information Technology (IT) policy in the United States. Findings indicatedthat PHC has a variable impact on current clinical practice, creates complex questions for providers, patients, and policy-makers, and will require a robust health IT infrastructure with advanced data architecture, clinical decision support, provider workflow tools, and re-use of clinical data for research. A number of health IT challenge areas were identified, along with five policy areas including: interoperable clinical decision support, standards for patient values and preferences, patient engagement, data transparency, and robust privacy and security. © 2013 IMIA and IOS Press.","Clinical; Decision Support Systems; Decision-Making; Electronic Health Records; Informatics; Patient Engagement; Personalized Medicine; Shared; Translational Bioinformatics","Artificial intelligence; Clinical research; Decision making; Diagnosis; Environmental technology; Patient treatment; Clinical; Electronic health record; Informatics; Patient Engagement; Personalized medicines; Shared; Decision support systems; computer security; confidentiality; decision support system; electronic medical record; health care policy; health care survey; medical informatics; medical record; nonbiological model; organization; organization and management; personalized medicine; procedures; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Health Care Surveys; Health Policy; Individualized Medicine; Medical Informatics; Medical Record Linkage; Models, Organizational; Organizational Objectives","","","","","","","Priorities for Personalized Medicine, (2008); Calif State J Med, (1905); Kavsak, Peter A., Whether it is personalized, precision, or mechanistic medicine - the clinical laboratory has a role, Clinical Biochemistry, 45, 6, (2012); Khoury, Muin Joseph, A population approach to precision medicine, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 42, 6, pp. 639-645, (2012); Mirnezami, Reza, Preparing for precision medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, 366, 6, pp. 489-491, (2012); Busy Physician S Guide to Genetics Genomics and Personalized Medicine, (2011); Ramoni, Rachel B., Predictive genomics of cardioembolic stroke, Stroke, 40, 3 SUPPL. 1, pp. S67-S70, (2009); Guttmacher, Alan E., The family history - More important than ever, New England Journal of Medicine, 351, 22, pp. 2333-2336, (2004); Volk, Lynn A., Do physicians take action on high risk family history information provided by patients outside of a clinic visit?, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, 129, pp. 13-17, (2007); Forum, (2007)","J.S.
