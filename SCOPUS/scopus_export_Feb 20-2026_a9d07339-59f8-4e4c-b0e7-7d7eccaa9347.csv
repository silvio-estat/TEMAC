Avoiding a Smart Building Diagnostics as a Service system and establishing a centralized design allowed for the rapid creation and implementation of this cloud-based system within one calendar year. Thus, I also managed to develop a 24/7 uninterrupted data provision workflow using all the Databricks integrational features that included data fetching, cleaning, and analysis of energy consumption, including forecasting and anomaly detection. Currently, the indicated system is capable of monitoring and detecting faults for 96 administrative buildings located on an active military base. The different activities of the system are executed within an average of 14 min. It also secures the first interface to the cloud data lake through SFTP and BLOB file system secure protocol drivers for automated first-phase data loading. These processes were integrated into collaborative notebooks within the pipeline using PySpark—a reliable Python binding for Apache Spark. The pipeline has been well controlled and set up in terms of workflow and continues to meet the deployment tasks. Regarding the architecture of our system, this paper outlines it and distinguishes it from previous attempts at diagnosing smart buildings; it also describes the technology stack of the data pipeline of the big data analytics solution, as well as key steps for BLG’s management and updating in the Indian context. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","","Big data applications; Centralised; Cloud-based; Computing environments; Data fetching; Energy; Fault detection systems; Performance computing; Service systems; Work-flows; Smart homes","","","","","","","Omer, Abdeen Mustafa, Energy, environment and sustainable development, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 12, 9, pp. 2265-2300, (2008); New Countryside, (2024); Mthembu, Zamani Khulekani, Developing a data lakehouse for a South African government-sector training authority: Governance framework design through systematic literature review, Machine Learning and Data Science Techniques for Effective Government Service Delivery, pp. 185-224, (2024); Horvath, Kaleb, Cloud-Based Infrastructure and DevOps for Energy Fault Detection in Smart Buildings, Computers, 13, 1, (2024); R2snet Scalable Domain Adaptation for Object Detection in Cloud Based Robots Ecosystems Via Proposal Refinement Arxiv Preprint Arxiv, (2024); Markus, Andre A., Deployment of real-time building automation system-integrated inverse-model-based fault detection and diagnostics algorithms, Science and Technology for the Built Environment, 30, 2, pp. 134-152, (2024); Ljubisavljević, Miloš R., A Comparison of Event Sourcing Implementations: Using Apache Kafka Streams APIs and Microsoft Service Fabric Actor Services, 2024 23rd International Symposium INFOTEH-JAHORINA, INFOTEH 2024 - Proceedings, (2024); Gokulnath, S., Leveraging Data Analytics in Azure for Effective Churn Management, 2nd International Conference on Emerging Trends in Information Technology and Engineering, ic-ETITE 2024, (2024); Garamendi, (2024); Stojchevska, Marija, Unlocking the potential of smartphone and ambient sensors for ADL detection, Scientific Reports, 14, 1, (2024)","K.K.

Modern eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques focus on benchmark datasets, but the cognitive applicability of such solutions under big data settings is still unclear due to memory or computation constraints. In this paper, we extend a model-agnostic XAI methodology, named Cluster-Aided Space Transformation for Local Explanation (CASTLE), to be able to deal with high-volume datasets. CASTLE aims to explain the black-box behavior of predictive models by combining both local (i.e., based on the input sample) and global (i.e., based on the whole scope for action of the model) information. In particular, the local explanation provides a rule-based explanation for the prediction of a target instance as well as the directions to update the likelihood of the predicted class. Our extension leverages modern big data technologies (e.g., Apache Spark) to handle the high volume, variety, and velocity of huge datasets. We have evaluated the framework on five datasets, in terms of temporal efficiency, explanation quality, and model significance. Our results indicate that the proposed approach retains the high-quality explanations associated with CASTLE while efficiently handling large datasets. Importantly, it exhibits a sub-linear, rather than exponential, dependence on dataset size, making it a scalable solution for massive datasets or in any big data scenario. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Clustering; eXplainable artificial intelligence","Clustering algorithms; Large datasets; Benchmark datasets; Black boxes; Clusterings; Data architectures; Explainable artificial intelligence; Financial domains; High volumes; Medical domains; Military domains; Space transformations; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Firouzi, Farshad, The convergence and interplay of edge, fog, and cloud in the AI-driven Internet of Things (IoT), Information Systems, 107, (2022); Cao, Longbing, AI in Finance: Challenges, Techniques, and Opportunities, ACM Computing Surveys, 55, 3, (2022); Huang, Changwu, An Overview of Artificial Intelligence Ethics, IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, 4, 4, pp. 799-819, (2023); Strouse, Daniel J., Collaborating with Humans without Human Data, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 18, pp. 14502-14515, (2021); Li, Zhibin, An overview of calibration technology of industrial robots, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 8, 1, pp. 23-36, (2021); Zhou, Xuanhe, Database Meets Artificial Intelligence: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 34, 3, pp. 1096-1116, (2022); Jiao, Licheng, New Generation Deep Learning for Video Object Detection: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 33, 8, pp. 3195-3215, (2022); Li, Jing, A Survey on Deep Learning for Named Entity Recognition, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 34, 1, pp. 50-70, (2022); Li, Zhibin, A Novel Calibration System for Robot Arm via an Open Dataset and a Learning Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, 69, 12, pp. 5169-5173, (2022); Li, Zhibin, Diversified Regularization Enhanced Training for Effective Manipulator Calibration, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 34, 11, pp. 8778-8790, (2023)","G.

Effective data analysis provides actionable knowledge which is a competitive advantage for organizations. Metadata management in data lakes is a key element in ensuring their full functionality. At the same time, this is a dynamic and under-researched area that reflects the rapid development of information technology and the business needs for effective data management. The research is based on a thorough scientific analysis of existing publications on the chosen topic. For this purpose, up-to-date and relevant open access publications from Scopus and Web of Science that correspond to the keywords ""data lake"" and ""metadata"" are identified and are from the last 15 years. Based on a review of the existing literature, the main challenges in data lake metadata management are highlighted. The goal of the research is to summarize the existing models in the field of metadata management in data lakes and to propose a new conceptual framework that can serve as a useful guide for designing and implementing metadata management models in heterogeneous data warehouses, as well as implementation steps. The concept's adoption involves a detailed study of the data management model in a specific organization, a measurement of the level of effectiveness after the model’s implementation, and the use of additional metrics to confirm its feasibility. These tasks are therefore the subject of future research. Another limitation of the proposed framework is that it does not address in depth the rules and standards related to ensuring data security, which would be of the highest priority especially in sectors such as finance, defence and healthcare. In addition, further research could also focus on future analysis of the level of satisfaction with the transformation of metadata management processes. © 2024, Dimitar A Tsenov Academy of Economics.

The Snort sensor must be placed within the same physical network, and the defense centers in the typical NIDS architecture offer limited network coverage, especially for remote networks with a restricted bandwidth and network policy. Additionally, the growing number of sensor instances, followed by a quick increase in log data volume, has caused the present system to face big data challenges. This research paper proposes a novel design for a cloud‐based Snort NIDS using containers and implementing big data in the defense center to overcome these problems. Our design consists of Docker as the sensor’s platform, Apache Kafka, as the distributed messaging system, and big data technology orchestrated on lambda architecture. We conducted experiments to measure sensor deploy-ment, optimum message delivery from the sensors to the defense center, aggregation speed, and efficiency in the data‐processing performance of the defense center. We successfully developed a cloud‐based Snort NIDS and found the optimum method for message‐delivery from the sensor to the defense center. We also succeeded in developing the dashboard and attack maps to display the attack statistics and visualize the attacks.

Existing safety management methods lack support from actual operational and production data, resulting in a lack of guidance of fault cause modes and risk chains. Large space is available to improve the breadth, depth, and accuracy of hazard source control. By mining multisource heterogeneous operation big data generated from subway operation, this study researches operation risk chain and refined management and control of key hidden dangers. First, it builds a data pool based on the operation status of several cities and then links them into a data lake to form an integrated data warehouse to find coupled and interactive rail transit operation risk chains. Second, it reveals and analyzes the risk correlation mechanisms behind the data and refines the key hazards in the risk chain. Finally, under the guidance of the risk chain, it deeply studies the technologies for refined control and governance of key hidden dangers. The results can truly transform rail transit operation safety from passive response to active defense, improving the special emergency rail transit operation plans, improving the current situation of low utilization of rail transit operation data, but high operation failure rate, and providing a basis for evidence-based formulation and revision of relevant industry standards and specifications. © 2021 Yongsheng Tang.","","","","","","","","","Industry and Mine Automation, (2011); Journal of Frontiers of Computer Science Technology, (2012); Design and Implementation of an Internet Information Mining System Based on Semantic Information Extraction, (2010); Adaptive Multi Objective Clustering Ensemble Selection for High Dimensional Data, (2018); El Mazouri, Fatima Zahra, Breaking Symmetries in Association Rules, Procedia Computer Science, 148, pp. 283-290, (2019); Weng, Jinxian, Exploring shipping accident contributory factors using association rules, Journal of Transportation Safety and Security, 11, 1, pp. 36-57, (2019); Modern Computer Professional, (2018); Safety Security, (2018); Martello, Michael V., Evaluation of climate change resilience for Boston's rail rapid transit network, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 97, (2021); Journal of Safety Science and Technology, (2019)","Y.

For example, over the last few years, governments started to extract knowledge and derive insights from vastly growing open data to personalize the advertisements in elections, improve government services, predict intelligence activities, as well as to improve national security and public health. A key challenge in analyzing social data is to transform the raw data generated by social actors into curated data, i.e., contextualized data and knowledge that is maintained and made available for use by end-users and applications. To address this challenge, we present the notion of knowledge lake, i.e., a contextualized Data Lake, to provide the foundation for big data analytics by automatically curating the raw social data and to prepare them for deriving insights. We present a social data curation foundry, namely DataSynapse, to enable analysts engage with social data to uncover hidden patterns and generate insight. In DataSynapse, we present a scalable algorithm to transform social items (e.g., a Tweet in Twitter) into semantic items, i.e., contextualized and curated items. This algorithm offers customizable feature extraction to harness desired features from diverse data sources. To link contextualized information items to the domain knowledge, we present a scalable technique which leverages cross document coreference resolution assisting analysts to derive targeted insights. DataSynapse is offered as an extensible and scalable microservice-based architecture that are publicly available on GitHub supporting networks such as Twitter, Facebook, GooglePlus and LinkedIn. We adopt a typical scenario for analyzing urban social issues from Twitter as it relates to the government budget, to highlight how DataSynapse significantly improves the quality of extracted knowledge compared to the classical curation pipeline (in the absence of feature extraction, enrichment and domain-linking contextualization). © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Big data analytics; Data curation; Feature engineering; Knowledge lake; Social networks analytics","Budget control; Extraction; Feature extraction; Foundries; Lakes; National security; Semantics; Social networking (online); Big Data Analytics; Contextualization; Cross document coreference; Data curation; Feature engineerings; Government services; Intelligence activities; Scalable algorithms; Big data","","","","","","","Social Network Data Analytics, (2011); Anderson, Michael R., Brainwash: A data system for feature engineering, CIDR 2013 - 6th Biennial Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, (2013); Corr, (2012); Behehsti, Amin, Galaxy: A platform for explorative analysis of Open Data sources, Advances in Database Technology - EDBT, 2016-March, pp. 640-643, (2016); Behehsti, Amin, Scalable graph-based OLAP analytics over process execution data, Distributed and Parallel Databases, 34, 3, pp. 379-423, (2016); Behehsti, Amin, Process analytics: Concepts and techniques for querying and analyzing process data, Process Analytics: Concepts and Techniques for Querying and Analyzing Process Data, pp. 1-178, (2016); IEEE Data Eng Bull, (2016); Behehsti, Amin, On automating basic data curation tasks, 26th International World Wide Web Conference 2017, WWW 2017 Companion, pp. 165-169, (2017); Behehsti, Amin, A systematic review and comparative analysis of cross-document coreference resolution methods and tools, Computing, 99, 4, pp. 313-349, (2017); Behehsti, Amin, CoreDB: A data lake service, International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings, Part F131841, pp. 2451-2454, (2017)","A.

In part, this is due to the high volume of incoming data that are available to the operational community. However, better exploitation of these data streams can be accomplished through techniques that focus on the semantics of the incoming stream, to discover information-based alerts that generate knowledge that is only obtainable when considering the totality of the streams. In this paper, we present an agile data architecture for real-time data representation, integration, and querying situations over heterogeneous data streams using Semantic Web Technologies, with the goal of improved knowledge interoperability.

Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (TE) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the TE community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.The true product of TE is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the TE community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during TE. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace. The net result of these commercial best practices is a solid foundation for the DoD to transform how it uses data to achieve faster, better, and smarter decisions throughout the acquisition lifecycle. © 2018 IEEE.","Big Data; Cloud Computing; Data Analytics; Data Management; Department of Defense; Knowledge Management; Predictive Maintainance; Test and Evaluation; Virtualization","Aggregates; Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Knowledge management; Predictive analytics; Quality control; Virtualization; Acquisition systems; Cloud-computing; Data analytics; Department of Defence; Joint Strike Fighters; Predictive maintainance; Predictive models; Test and evaluation; Virtualizations; Weapon system; Decision making","","","","","","","","","Abe, N.; Liu, H.; Pu, C.; Hu, X.; Ahmed, N.; Qiao, M.; Song, Y.; Kossmann, D.; Liu, B.; Lee, K.; Tang, J.; He, J.; Saltz, J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Baidu; et al.; Expedia Group; IEEE; IEEE Computer Society; Squirrel AI Learning","2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2018","2018-12-10 through 2018-12-13","Seattle","144531","","9781538650356","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Different types of malicious activities have been explored by attackers. However, the existent defense mechanisms are not able to completely end the malicious threats, perpetuating this continuous arms race. The development of applications to mitigate those threats presents some complicating factors such as the growth in the amount of data, and the variety of data, that can come from different sources.
