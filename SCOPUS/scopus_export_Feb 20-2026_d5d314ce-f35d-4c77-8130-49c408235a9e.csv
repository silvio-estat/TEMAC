The chapter starts with a discussion of mission command respectively in terms of a culture or command philosophy, and as a set of methods and practices of command. It then discusses the role and future utility of mission command in light of developments in three broad areas of importance to the evolution of military command. These are, first, general trends in the current and future operational environment with implications for the command of land operations, with a focus on the US Army’s concept of multi-domain operations. The second area is the ever-increasing demands for information management, and the daunting challenge it poses for any military command system. The third is developments in information technology over the last decades and the more recent shift toward artificial intelligence and automation. © The several contributors 2023.","artificial intelligence; command culture; command methods; information; land operations; mission command; multi-domain operations","","","","","","","","Fighting Power German and U S Army Performance 1939 1945, (1982); Stormtroop Tactics Innovation in the German Army 1914 1918, (1989); Command or Control Command Training and Tactics in the British and German Armies 1888 1918, (1995); On the German Art of War Truppenfuhrung, (2001); Transforming Command the Pursuit of Mission Command in the U S British and Israeli Armies, (2011); Maneuver Warfare Handbook, (1985); On Tactics A Theory of Victory in Battle, (2017); Command in War, (1985); Muth, Jörg, Command culture: Officer education in the U.S. Army and the german armed forces, 1901-1940, and the consequences for world war II, Command Culture: Officer Education in the U.S. Army and the German Armed Forces, 1901-1940, and the Consequences for World War II, pp. 1-366, (2011); Adopting Mission Command Developing Leaders for A Superior Command Culture, (2019)","","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","","9780191948220; 9780192857422","","","English","Advanced Land Warfare: Tactics and operations","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186025660"

A system of data generation, transferring, storing and restoration is proposed, which includes peripheral nodes made with the possibility of data generation and storing and their subsequent transferring via communication lines to a central node for storage. Each of the peripheral nodes is additionally connected with each other peripheral node by communication lines, and communication lines provide the ability to transfer data, generated in each of the peripheral nodes, for storage on one or several other peripheral nodes and the ability to transfer data to one of the peripheral nodes and to restore data on it in case of the central node loss. A method using the specified system is also proposed. The study objectives are to provide a stability high level of the system and method of generation, transferring, storing and restoration data to data loss, including possibly the holistic body of data, with data loss at the central and one or more peripheral nodes of the system while reducing risk of unauthorised access to data and level of energy consumption. The objectives of the study are achieved by the fact that the pairwise peripheral nodes connect with all other peripheral nodes via communication lines, while the simultaneous connection of all peripheral nodes with the central node via communication lines allows ensuring the integrity of data available in the data generation and storing system in case of complete data loss on the central node and one or more peripheral nodes with a limited number of data copies generated in each of the nodes. Research results can be used in database management systems, server network topology, cryptocurrencies, the financial and banking sectors' information systems, objects and processes automatic control systems, etc. In addition, the results of the study can be used in the development of the concept of network-centric warfare. © 2022 IEEE.","central node; centralized systems; communication line; computer networks.; data; data replication; distributed systems; hybrid centralized-distributed systems; peripheral node","Automation; Computer networks; Data communication equipment; Data communication systems; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Energy utilization; Information management; Network topology; Restoration; Central nodes; Centralized systems; Communication lines; Computer network.; Data; Data replication; Distributed systems; Hybrid centralized; Hybrid centralized-distributed system; Peripheral nodes; Data transfer","","","","","","","Baran, Paul, On Distributed Communications Networks, IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems, 12, 1, pp. 1-9, (1964); Al-Rushdan, Huthifh, Zero-day attack detection and prevention in software-defined networks, Proceedings - 2019 International Arab Conference on Information Technology, ACIT 2019, pp. 278-282, (2019); Cryptography Mailing List, (2009); Bbc News, (2021); Faiz, Nursultan Saparulu, Visualization of geodata of seasonal fluctuations of magnetic fields based on esri arcgis, News of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Series of Geology and Technical Sciences, 1, 445, pp. 66-72, (2021); Tercan, Emre, Geographic information system–assisted site quality assessment for hazelnut cultivation using multi-criteria decision analysis in the Black Sea region, Turkey, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 24, pp. 35908-35933, (2022); Nikonov, Oleh Yakovlevich, Parametric synthesis of a dynamic object control system with nonlinear characteristics, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2608, pp. 91-101, (2020); Uspensky, B.

This chapter reviews the development of the matrix then describes two case studies and discusses lessons learned. The structure is a 4 × 4 matrix; the rows describe the four general management domains of any complex system (physical, information, cognitive, social) as described in the US Army’s Network-Centric Warfare doctrine and the columns describe the four stages of disaster management (plan/prepare, absorb/withstand, recover, adapt) as defined by the US National Academy of Sciences in their definition of disaster resilience. Collectively, these sixteen cells provide a general description of the functionality of a system through an adverse event. The matrix serves as an organizing framework for a screening-level assessment of the resilience of a system with respect to each critical service it provides. Indicators linked to each cell can be used to describe system performance and identify areas for further investigation. Additionally, the matrix framework can be used to organize the many government agencies and community institutions across different spatial scales that contribute to the operation of each critical service. In this way the matrix serves as a tool to initiate resilience planning and coordination, address jurisdictional issues, and identify gaps in the various roles and responsibilities for complex urban systems where human performance and decision making plays a critical role. The case studies described here (Rockaway, New York City and Mobile, Alabama, USA) are focused on coastal community resilience in the face of storm surge and flooding; however, the lessons learned speak to the broader contribution of the resilience matrix to the fields of risk assessment and urban planning. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Coastal flooding; Community resilience; Resilience case study; Resilience matrix; Resilience metrics","Complex networks; Coordination reactions; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Floods; Large scale systems; Risk assessment; Urban planning; Coastal flooding; Community resiliences; Disaster resiliences; Integrated complexes; Performance assessment; Resilience case study; Resilience metrics; US National Academy of Sciences; Information management","","","","","","","Power to the Edge Command and Control in the Information Age, (2003); Evolution of the 1936 Flood Control Act, (1988); Validating Resilience and Vulnerability Indices in the Context of Natural Disasters, (2016); Tropical Cyclone Report Hurricane Sandy, (2013); Bruneau, Michel, Enhancing the resilience of communities against extreme events from an earthquake engineering perspective, Journal of Security Education, 1, 4, pp. 159-167, (2006); Cutter, Susan C., Disaster resilience: A national imperative, Environment, 55, 2, pp. 25-29, (2013); Solutions, (2014); European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, (2016); Fox-Lent, Cate, A matrix approach to community resilience assessment: an illustrative case at Rockaway Peninsula, Environment Systems and Decisions, 35, 2, pp. 209-218, (2015); Multi Criteria Decision Analysis Environmental Applications and Case Studies, (2012)","C.

Accordingly, some enhanced CDLs, which has high capacity and networking technology, has been developed around the world. In various network topologies for enhanced CDLs, hub network is a typical topology because of simple implementation complexity. Also, in order to support multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) simultaneously within limited bandwidth, hybrid frequency division multiple access (FDMA)/time division multiple access (TDMA) can be considered. However, due to different round-trip time (RTT) and data traffic size of each UAV, idle time resource and unnecessary packet transmission delay can occur in hub network, and they can reduce efficiency of hub network in long distance communication. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RTT/traffic size based UAV resource scheduling. The proposed scheme selects time/frequency resource of UAVs by using iterative ascending sort algorithm and traffic based weighting method, which uses gradually decreased weighting value per sorting iteration. We verify that the proposed scheme can improve data rate and packet delay performance.","ATN; CDL; Hub network; Resource scheduling; UAV","Complex networks; Electric network topology; Information management; Iterative methods; Packet networks; Scheduling; Time division multiple access; Topology; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); ATN; CDL; Hub networks; Implementation complexity; Long distance communication; Packet transmission delays; Resource-scheduling; Tactical Communications; Frequency division multiple access","","","","","","","Commun Kiise, (2020); 2012 MILCOM Direcnet Technical Panel, (2012); J Kics, (2014); Russ Hamilton, B., Tradeoffs in coordination and performance in medium access scheduling, IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings, (2014); Proc IEEE PIMRC, (2007); J Kic Mag, (2011); Kics, (2012)","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc acmhelp@acm.org","ACM SIGAPP","9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication, ACM IMCOM 2015","2015-01-08 through 2015-01-10","Bali","111491","","9781450333771","","","English","ACM IMCOM - Proc.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926175588"

Induced by the ongoing transformation process of the military forces and the changing security policy a set of additional sensors and information sensors is required to contribute to the tactical picture compilation. In the field of military target identification and classification many publications are known describing a data fusion process for typical military sensors and sources. Classical sensor equipment like IFF and ESM and sources like Flight Plans, Airspace Control Procedures, Identification by Origin and Link- 16 are well known and standardized how to be integrated into a Bayesian fusion process. These standardized sources will continue to be important information sources of the information fusion process. However further sensor types and information sources will contribute in the future to the information fusion process and will complete the Situational Awareness, especially in the context of asymmetric situations and semi-military missions.

The WA uses a doctrinally-based knowledge representation to model role-specific workflows and continuously monitors the state of the operational environment to enable decision-support, delivering the right information to the right person at the right time. Capabilities include: (1) analyzing combat events reported in chat rooms and other sources for relevance based on role, order-of-battle, time, and geographic location, (2) combining seemingly disparate pieces of data into meaningful information, (3) driving displays to provide users with map based and textual descriptions of the current tactical situation, and (4) recommending courses of action with respect to necessary staff collaborations, execution of battle-drills, re-tasking of ISR assets, and required reporting. The results of a scenario-based human-in-the-loop experiment are reported. The underlying WA knowledge-graph representation serves as state traces, measuring aspects of Soldier decision-making performance (e.g. improved efficiency in allocating limited ISR assets) across runtime as dynamic events unfold on a simulated battlefield. © 2014 SPIE.","associate system; cognitive workload; data to decisions; decision support; force synchronization; intelligent agent; ISR; metrics of performance; mission command; OODA loop; resource management; system interoperability","Cognitive systems; Decision support systems; Intelligent agents; Interoperability; Knowledge representation; Software agents; associate system; Cognitive workloads; data to decisions; Decision supports; ISR; Metrics of performance; Mission command; OODA loop; Resource management; System interoperability; Information management","","","","","","","Warfighter Associate Objective and Automated Metrics for Mission Command, (2013); Discourses on Winning and Losing Unpublished Slide Presentation, (1986); Anderson, John Robert, Working memory: Activation limitations on retrieval, Cognitive Psychology, 30, 3, pp. 221-256, (1996); Baddeley, Alan D., Working memory, Science, 255, 5044, pp. 556-559, (1992); Cowan, Nelson, Working Memory Capacity, Working Memory Capacity, pp. 1-225, (2005); Situation Awareness Analysis and Measurement, (2000); Engineering Psychology and Human Performance, (2000); Wierwille, Walter W., Recommendations for mental workload measurement in a test and evaluation environment, Human Factors, 35, 2, pp. 263-281, (1993); From Data to Decisions, (2012)","","","SPIE spie@spie.org","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Ground/Air Multisensor Interoperability, Integration, and Networking for Persistent ISR V","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905727950"

The discussion about security measures is essential, especially, because the field of national defense includes military informations influencing directly to the national security. The enhancement of security, however, makes may difficult for information to be managed in real-time, resulting in limiting the use of information in real time, therefore the both security and efficiency should be considered.

The connectivity between these enclaves consists of tactical links with intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and variable latency. Therefore, the information sharing architecture must accommodate unreliable and transiently disconnected networks. Our middleware approach realizes a set of federation services to interconnect multiple instances of the U.S. Marine Corps' Marine Command and Control Systems and Applications Tactical Service-oriented Architecture (MC2SA TSoA). This federation capability supports a publish/subscribe/query model and provides reliability in the information exchange between information enclaves.

Traditional surveillance systems operate in a centralized fashion, in that peripheral sensor units gather data from the environment, locally process them, and transmit (either raw or processed) data to a central node where information fusion occurs. It is well known, however, how the presence of a central fusion node represents a weakness point of centralized architectures for several reasons. First, a fault in such a node would actually make the overall network unusable. Second, the centralized approach is not scalable since the computational complexity of the fusion node grows with the number of network nodes. Finally, for large-scale networks, it is reasonable to think that nodes are organized, from a topological point of view, according to a complex structure incompatible with the presence of a unique fusion center. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Complex networks; Military applications; Monitoring; Security systems; Sensor data fusion; Sensor networks; Viruses; Centralized approaches; Centralized architecture; Information and Communication Technologies; Large-scale network; Network centric warfare; Peripheral sensors; Surveillance systems; Threat assessment; Computer viruses","","","","","","","Julier, Simon J., Non-divergent estimation algorithm in the presence of unknown correlations, Proceedings of the American Control Conference, 4, pp. 2369-2373, (1997); Julier, Simon, General Decentralized Data Fusion with Covariance Intersection (CI), Handbook of Multisensor Data Fusion, pp. 12-12-25, (2001); Chen, Lingji, Estimation under unknown correlation: Covariance intersection revisited, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 47, 11, pp. 1879-1882, (2002); Olfati-Saber, Reza, Consensus and cooperation in networked multi-agent systems, Proceedings of the IEEE, 95, 1, pp. 215-233, (2007); Olfati-Saber, Reza, Consensus problems in networks of agents with switching topology and time-delays, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 49, 9, pp. 1520-1533, (2004); Kephart, Jeffrey O., Directed-graph epidemiological models of computer viruses, Proceedings of the Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 343-358, (1991); Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo, Epidemic spreading in scale-free networks, Physical Review Letters, 86, 14, pp. 3200-3203, (2001); Lecture Notes in Physics, (2003); Zou, Cliff Changchun, Modeling and simulation study of the propagation and defense of internet e-mail worms, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 4, 2, pp. 105-118, (2007); Chakrabarti, Deepayan, Epidemic thresholds in real networks, ACM Transactions on Information and System Security, 10, 4, (2008)","","","CRC Press","","","","","","","9781439883242; 9781439883259","","","English","Effective Surveillance for Homel.

One of the fundamental requirements for network-centric warfare is the timely exchange of information critical to mission success. The Phoenix Information Management Services (IMS) have been developed to address this all-important requirement. This paper describes a set of federation services that extend the Phoenix IMS to span multiple enclaves or domains of information management. Federation services interconnect multiple instances of Phoenix and support controlled information exchange across enclaves. Federation services, coupled with the core Phoenix information management services, are a force multiplier, allowing information to be shared across not just one, but any number of domains and information spaces. This in turn promotes shared situational awareness, unity of command, and synchronized operations across a variety of missions. © 2012 IEEE.","Coalition Operations; Information Management; Interoperability; Network-centric systems and technologies; System of systems","Coalition operations; Exchange of information; Force multipliers; Information exchanges; Information spaces; Mission success; Multiple instances; Network-centric system; Network-centric warfare; Shared situational awareness; System of systems; Unity of Command; Warfighting capabilities; Information management; Military communications; Interoperability","","","","","","","Proceedings of 10th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, (2005); Grant, Robert, Phoenix: SOA based information management services, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 7350, (2009); Suri, Niranjan, A dynamic and policy-controlled approach to federating information systems, Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM, pp. 225-230, (2010); Ksco 2010; Suri, Niranjan, An adaptive and efficient peer-to-peer Service-oriented Architecture for MANET environments with agile computing, 2008 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium Workshops - NOMS 08, pp. 364-371, (2008); Carvalho., Marco M., A cross-layer communications framework for tactical environments, Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM, (2006)","","","","AFCEA International; IEEE Communications Society","2012 IEEE Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2012","","","","21557578","0780393937; 9780780393936; 9781538671856; 9781424415137; 9781424426775; 078030585X; 9780769551241; 0780309537; 9798350374230; 0780306775","PMICE","","English","Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874300130"

We developed a set of novel information awareness metrics to enable responsive situation assessment under mission-critical conditions. The awareness metrics model (AMM) reflects the global information values of event locations such as position, terrain information, dangerousness, survivability, cell difficulty, and mission importance. Based on the enhanced awareness model, we developed an in-network cooperative multi-sensor search and track (ICMS) algorithm by solving a unified optimization problem in which each cell is searched and all detected objects are tracked for at least a desired track-lifetime period. We utilize a track-lifetime surface metric to represent the spatial and temporal aspects of object movements over a region of interest that requires frequent sampling of the known and estimated object positions (track maintenance) as well as possible object arrivals (track initiation). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented our ICMS algorithm in a numerical example and found that it is effective in the sense that most cells with high activity are well-searched. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","active sensing; Awareness modeling; compressive sensing; performance metrics; sensor management","Active Sensing; Awareness modeling; compressive sensing; performance metrics; sensor management; Algorithms; Data handling; Sensors; Information management","","","","","","","Wang, Yue, Awareness-based decision making for search and tracking, Proceedings of the American Control Conference, pp. 3169-3175, (2008); Kreucher, Chris M., Sensor management using an active sensing approach, Signal Processing, 85, 3, pp. 607-624, (2005); Chung, Timothy H., On a decentralized active sensing strategy using mobile sensor platforms in a network, Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2, pp. 1914-1919, (2004); Multitarget Multisensor Tracking Applications and Advances, (1992); Evans, Jamie S., Optimal sensor scheduling for hidden Markov model state estimation, International Journal of Control, 74, 18, pp. 1737-1742, (2001); Zhao, Feng, Collaborative signal and information processing: An information-directed approach, Proceedings of the IEEE, 91, 8, pp. 1199-1209, (2003); Network Centric Warfare Developing and Leveraging Information Superiority, (1999)","","","","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Signal and Data Processing of Small Targets 2010","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957965503"

Often, the data required to support a mission is not always resident within a single system, but is distributed among multiple systems that must be dynamically interconnected to support the data and information needs. While proprietary and stove-piped information systems have slowly given way to standardized information management architectures (such as the Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) architecture developed by the US Air Force Research Laboratory), each independent organization and/or mission is normally associated with a separate instance of a managed information space that operates in an independent manner. This is necessary given the different stakeholders and administrative domains responsible for the information. However, the demands for coordination and cooperation require interoperability and information exchange between these independently operating information spaces. This paper describes a federated approach to interconnecting multiple information spaces to enable data interchange. We propose a set of interfaces to facilitate dynamic, runtime discovery and federation of information spaces. We also integrate with the KAoS policy and domain services framework to realize policy-based control over the federation and exchange of information. Our approach allows clients to transparently perform publish, subscribe, and query operations across all the federated information spaces. We have integrated with three existing JBI implementations - Apollo from the Air Force Research Laboratory, Mercury from General Dynamics and AIMS from Northrop Grumman.

The System Entity Structure (SES) is an ontology framework that can facilitate information exchange in a network environment. From the perspective of the SES information exchange framework, the Battle Management Language (BML) serves to specify the information desired by a consumer in an unambiguous way. This paper formulates information exchange in the SES ontology via BML and defines novel pruning and transformation processes of the SES to extract and fuse data into higher-level representations. This supports increased interoperability between human users and other sensor systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed information exchange framework for data fusion systems, we illustrate the approach in an air defense operation scenario using Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) modeling and simulation. The demonstration shows that the information requested by a commander is delivered in the right way at the right time so that it can support agile decision making against threats. © 2010, The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

As a result, the development of the Global Information Grid (GIG) was the key enabler for this process; hence, adding to the development of the mobile networking part of the GIG, the concept of the Mobile Ad hoc Network of Networks (MANoN) is introduced. This article proposes a novel security management algorithm achieving the three management essentials: Security Administration; Prevention and Detection; and Containment and Recovery; based on the International Telecommunication Union's recommendation M.3400 to manage securely the future of military Network-Centric Warfare (NCW). The authors will employ Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) as a method of handling both sequential and parallel composition in flexible timely constrains, in addition, this technique will be evaluated using the Network Simulator (NS-2) to provide and check whether security requirements are met in a comprehensive manner.

Level 1 data fusion combines data from single or multiple sensors and sources to provide the best estimate of objects and events in the battlespace. Level 2 data fusion focuses on situation assessment. Level 3 data fusion is threat assessment. To facilitate situation assessment, we investigate the problem of jointly classifying and identifying multiple targets in radar sensor networks where the maximum number of categories and the maximum number of targets in each category are obtained a priori based on statistical data. However, the actual number of targets in each category and the actual number of target categories being present at any given time are assumed unknown. It is assumed that a given target belongs to one category and one identification number. The target signals are modeled as zero-mean complex Gaussian processes. We propose a joint multi-target identification and classification (JMIC) algorithm for radar surveillance using cognitive radars. The existing target categories are first classified and then the targets in each category are accordingly identified. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed JMIC algorithm in a query surveillance region. ©2009 IEEE.","Gaussian process; Multiple target identification and classification; Radar sensor networks; Situation assessment","Apriori; Battlespace; Best estimates; Gaussian Processes; Identification number; Level 2; Level-1; Multiple sensors; Multiple targets; Multitarget; Network centric warfare; Radar sensor network; Radar surveillance; Simulation result; Situation assessment; Statistical datas; Target signals; Threat assessment; Zero-mean complex; Data fusion; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Information fusion; Military communications; Radar; Sensor networks; Targets","","","","","","","undefined, (2010); Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing Estimation Theory, (1993); Kotecha, Jayesh H., Distributed multitarget classification in wireless sensor networks, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 23, 4, pp. 703-712, (2005); Joint Multi Target Identification and Classi Fication in Cognitive Radar Sensor Networks, (2010); Liang, Qinglin Lian, Automatic target recognition using waveform diversity in radar sensor networks, Pattern Recognition Letters, 29, 3, pp. 377-381, (2008); Meesookho, Chartchai, Collaborative classification applications in sensor networks, Proceedings of the IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop, 2002-January, pp. 370-374, (2002); Premebida, Cristiano, A multi-target tracking and GMM-classifier for intelligent vehicles, IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Proceedings, ITSC, pp. 313-318, (2006); Teti, Joseph G., A multifeature decision space approach to radar target identification, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 32, 1, pp. 480-487, (1996); Vercauteren, Tom, Joint multiple target tracking and classification in collaborative sensor networks, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 23, 4, pp. 714-723, (2005)","H.-S.

Only the Internet has made this kind of concept possible, bringing together millions of software developers from around the world to pool their knowledge. The tremendous success of open source software has prompted many corporations to adopt the culture of open source and thus share information they previously held secret. The government, and specifically the Department of Defense (DoD), could also benefit from adopting an open source culture. In acquiring satellite systems, the DoD often builds walls between program offices, but installing doors between programs can promote collaboration and information sharing. This paper addresses the challenges and consequences of adopting an open source culture to facilitate technology collaboration for DoD space acquisitions.

Bot armies pose one of the most serious security threats to all networks. Botnets, remotely controlled and operated by botmasters or botherders, can launch massive denial of service attacks, multiple penetration attacks, or any other malicious network activity on a massive scale. Bot army activity has, in the past, been limited to fraud, blackmail, and other forms of criminal activity. However, their potential has been underestimated for causing large-scale damage to the entire Internet; for launching large-scale, coordinated attacks on government computers and networks; and for large-scale, coordinated data gathering from thousands of users and computers on any network. In a ""botnet"" or ""bot army"", computers can be used to spread spam, launch denial-of-service attacks against Web sites, conduct fraudulent activities, and prevent authorized network traffic from traversing the network. This paper will not discuss how to build bots but the threats they pose. In this paper, we examine the need for botnet defense training within existing simulation environments and present our suggestions for the capabilities needed for training systems for botnet activities. This paper discusses botnet technology and reviews the technologies that underlie this threat to network, information, and computer security. The second section contains background information about bot armies and key foundational bot technologies. The third section presents a discussion of the types of attacks that botnets can conduct, defenses against them and our suggestions for simulating botnet activities, including suggested message formats for distributing bot simulation commands and for distributing information needed to simulate both the effects of bot attacks and defensive responses to bot attacks.

A tiered process provides operational context and increasingly detailed design including threads and interfaces that mix the live and simulation domains. An integration framework provides standard services such as translation, information management, reliable transport, and display capabilities, allowing independent systems to be used in a broader SoS context. Development and use of the framework over several years enabled true bi-directional data flow between domains this year, expanding the SoS context under study. Maturing individual technologies, comparing live and simulated systems, and validating simulation models are among the presented results. Mixed mode experimentation enables the combination of scaling (via simulation in a high-performance computing environment) and operational execution (via live systems in a realistic field environment) not possible otherwise. The resulting insights further PM C4ISR On-The-Move's campaign goals of supporting the deployment of C4ISR technology within a Network Centric Warfare context. Application beyond this organization is at three levels: 1) the use of the process and methods to general LVC/SoS problems, 2) the integration approach itself to bridge domains and enable system interaction, and 3) the resulting ability to mature component technologies.","C4ISR; Integration framework; LVC; Mixed experiment; System of systems","System of systems; Systems engineering; C4ISR; Component technologies; High performance computing; Individual technology; Integration approach; Integration frameworks; Network centric warfare; System interactions; Information management","","","","","","","Information Knowledge Systems Management, (2001); Valerdi, Ricardo, A framework for evolving system of systems engineering, CrossTalk, 20, 10, pp. 28-30, (2007); Implementation of Network Centric Warfare, (2005); Systems Engineering Coping with Complexity, (1998); Common Warfighting Symbology, (2008); IEEE Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation Application Protocols, (1995); National Imagery Transmission Format Nitf Version, (2006); Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects, (2000); Technology Readiness Assessment Tra Deskbook, (2025); Final Report of the Rto Information Systems Technology Panel, (2007)","R.E.

The concept of temporal convergence was developed to help apply information and knowledge management theory to some of the complex military processes addressed under Network-Centric Warfare, such as: commander's intent, course of action, situational awareness and self-synchronisation. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is grounded in a pragmatist philosophy and constructivist epistemology. The argument is intuitive and uses common-sense examples to elucidate the concepts. Findings: The framework is shown to be useful in describing and reasoning about the knowledge requirements and prerequisites for distributed decision-making through the sharing of situational knowledge and common intentions, with practical application to the planning and execution of operations. And to the designers of knowledge management systems seeking to address this space, it presents a real and practical challenge that could generate novel temporal approaches to data and information management. Originality/value: The importance of time and epistemology has been neglected in the knowledge and information management literature, especially in the operational context. Time and knowledge have been conceptualised in conventional knowledge management systems as either ""timeless"" recordings of procedures, or time-stamped records of past events and states. This paper explores relatively new conceptions of time-and-knowledge, which should be of significance and interest to the wider community. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Armed forces; Knowledge management; Time study","","","","","","","","Bandura, Albert, Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective, Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 1-26, (2001); Bickhard, Mark H., Levels of representationality, Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 10, 2, pp. 179-215, (1998); Essence of Winning and Losing, (1996); Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Knowledge Management Kmap06, (2006); Proc Saicsit, (2005); Proceedings of the 10th International Command and Control Research Technology Symposium, (2005); 2006 Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium Ccrts, (2006); Structure of Scientific Revolutions, (1970); Journal of Knowledge Management; Development of Thought Equilibration of Cognitive Structures, (1977)","W.

Derived from the Latin collaborare, which means “work with” or through, collaboration is the process wherein agents work together through transaction. Collaboration entails the existence of a team if a common goal or purpose underlies the transaction. A virtual team exists when collaboration takes place (to a varying degree) through technology across time, space, and (often) organizational boundaries; also known as e-collaboration. As a general definition, we follow the lead of Kock and colleagues (Kock, Davison, Ocker, & Wazlawick, 2001;Kock & Nosek, 2005), and state that e-collaboration is “collaboration among individuals engaged in a common task using electronic technologies” ( Kock et al., 2001, p. 1). This is a very broad definition and includes such historical means of e-collaboration as the U.S. Department of Defense’s ARPANET and early group decision support systems (GDSSs) such as Lotus Notes (Kock & Nosek, 2005). Few would argue the contemporary impact computers, the Internet, and network architectures (e.g., local area networks; LANs) have had on collaboration and teams (Schwartz, Divitini, & Brasethvik, 2000). Current instantiations of e-collaborative systems include the Internet (which includes various e-collaborative subsystems such as Internet relay-chat, bulletin boards, and weblogs), videoconferencing, and virtual workstations. The opportunities created by this new wave of e-collaboration and virtual teamwork have, in turn, dramatically transformed military forces (e.g., network-centric warfare; Cebrowski, 1998), business (e.g., B2B collaboration; Rosenberg, 2003), infrastructure (e.g., traffic flow regulation; Jermann, 2001), and other areas of society (e.g., collaborative music development; Weinberg, 2005). © 2009 by IGI Global.

This information sharing enhances battle space situation awareness, which allows war fighters to get the right information at the right time and place, and to make the right decisions ahead of adversaries. IPv6 is an enabling technology of network-centric operations and warfare for improving the scalability, robustness, agility, security, flexibility and manageability of military communication systems. The large address space, built-in stateless node discovery, Internet Protocol (IP) security (IPSec) and mobility functions offered in IPv6 will be an important enabler for information sharing and distribution amongst war fighters in a dynamic battle space environment. As described in a mid-2003 memo 1, to achieve its vision of network-centric operations and warfare, the Department of Defense (DoD) established a goal to transition all military communications networks to IPv6 across the Global Information Grid (GIG), and for all systems that are part of the Defense Information System Network (DISN) that will interoperate with the GIG. The purpose of this paper is to present the Navy overall strategy of transitioning its critical network infrastructure to IPv6 to support network-centric warfare and fleet operations. The paper also highlights the U.S. Navy's recent accomplishments, namely the two Joint Staff IPv6 Operational Criteria - Criterion 4 (known as JCS 4) demonstrations of voice, data, and video integration. In addition, the paper discusses the way forward in light of the establishment and deployment of the multi-site Navy Technical Excellence Center with focus on current and future IPv6 test and evaluation - encompassing laboratory tests, field tests (i.e., experiments), demonstrations, and modeling and simulation - to address operational needs and requirements of the war fighters. ©2008 IEEE.","","Address spaces; Battle spaces; Defense informations; Department of defense; Enabling technologies; Field tests; Global information grids; Information sharing; Internet Protocol version 6; Joint staffs; Laboratory tests; Large arrays; Military communication systems; Mobile platforms; Mobility functions; Modeling and simulations; Multi sites; Network infrastructures; Network-centric operations; Network-centric warfares; Node discoveries; On currents; Operational concepts; Operational needs; Right informations; Space systems; Support networks; Technical excellences; Test and evaluations; U.s. navies; Video integrations; Communication systems; Distribution functions; Fighter aircraft; Fleet operations; Information dissemination; Information management; Information retrieval; Internet; Internet protocols; Local area networks; Military applications; Sensor networks; Space platforms; Voice/data communication systems; Wireless networks; Military communications","","","","","","","undefined, (2009); undefined, (2009); Test Report, (2006); Definition of the Differentiated Services Field Ds Field in the Ipv4 and Ipv6 Headers, (1998); Ncid T300 V3 Qos Draft Dscp Proposal Proposal 2, (2006); Jcs Criterion 4 Phase 2 Demonstration of Real Time Transport Protocol Rtp and Session Initiation Protocol Sip Capabilities Over an Ipv6 Network Test Report V1 0, (2007); Rtp A Transport Protocol for Real Time Applications, (2003); Sip Session Initiation Protocol, (2002); Sip for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions Simple; undefined, (2009)","","","","","2008 IEEE Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2008 - Assuring Mission Success","","","","21557578","0780393937; 9780780393936; 9781538671856; 9781424415137; 9781424426775; 078030585X; 9780769551241; 0780309537; 9798350374230; 0780306775","PMICE","","English","Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-62349132818"

To be operationally useful, such knowledge must he extracted, combined with information generated by the disaster itself, and transformed into actionable knowledge. The process, though, is hampered by existing, business-oriented approaches to knowledge management, by technical issues related to access to relevant, multi-domain information/knowledge, and by executive decision-making processes based predominantly on historical knowledge. Consequently, as shown by many recent incidents, the management of large-scale (mega) disasters is often inefficient and exceedingly costly. This paper demonstrates that the integration of modified information and knowledge management into the concepts of network-centric operations and network-enabled capabilities, and the employment of Boyd's OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop-based decision-making in unpredictable and dynamically changing environments, may address some of these problems. © Overseas Development Institute, 2008.","Actionable knowledge; Disaster management; Information management; Knowledge management; Leadership; Network-centric warfare; Network-centricity; Next-generation networks; OODA Loop; Prodrome; Teams of Leaders","decision making; disaster management; information management; leadership; article; disaster; disaster planning; human; information system; organization and management; relief work; rescue work; social support; United Kingdom; United States; Disaster Planning; Disasters; Great Britain; Humans; Information Management; Leadership; Relief Work; Rescue Work; Social Support","","","","","","","Signal, (2006); Alavi, Maryam, Review: Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 25, 1, pp. 107-136, (2001); Transformation Trends, (2004); Distributed Operations Translating Tactical Capabilities into Operational Effects, (2006); Grant, Robert M., The Resource-Based Theory of Competitive Advantage: Implications for Strategy Formulation, California Management Review, 33, 3, pp. 114-135, (1991); Prague Post, (2005); Hodgson, John, The headache of knowledge management, Nature Biotechnology, 19, 6s, pp. BE44-BE46, (2001); Howells, Jeremy R.L., The sourcing of technological knowledge: Distributed innovation processes and dynamic change, R and D Management, 33, 4, pp. 395-409, (2003); Hutchinson, John F., Disasters and the international order: Earthquakes, humanitarians, and the Ciraolo project, International History Review, 22, 1, pp. 1-36, (2000); Hutchinson, John F., Disasters and the international order - II: The international relief union, International History Review, 23, 2, pp. 253-298, (2001)","D.K.J.E. von Lubitz; HG and GA Dow College of Health Sciences, Central Michigan University, Mt.

The MRE SSA is capable of handling sensors with probability of detection p<inf>d</inf> < 1 and performs sensor selection based on various expected performance criteria in a target tracking scenario. For all three selection schemes the particle filtering technique has been used for target tracking with an adaption for missed detections in the case of p <inf>d</inf> < 1. Results are compared using multiple runs with simulated data for a single, moving target and two stationary radars. One sensor yields range, Doppler and bearing information, the other range and bearing information.

Avionic systems employing an Integrated Modular Architecture (IMA) are currently being deployed on new aircraft such as the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787. This paper lays out the applicability of the IMA approach to military aircraft such as tankers, bombers, surveillance aircraft and cargo aircraft. The IMA principles can be applied to both new aircraft designs and to existing aircraft that are going through an Aircraft Extension Program (AEP). The modular design of an IMA provides a number of advantages such as cost savings, shorter development time, and higher growth potential. It is scalable to meet the processing needs of the aircraft and is more flexible to implement. An IMA system can offer significant savings in weight, space, power, and cooling required over a comparable federated system. These advantages are particularly important as the Military Services begin to implement civil Communication Navigation and Surveillance for Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Network Centric Warfare concepts such as Real-Time Information in the Cockpit (RTIC) using military data links. The use of open standards in the architecture of the IMA allows third parties to implement both hardware and software modules in the IMA architecture. The General Processing Modules (GPMs) may host multiple software applications using an ARINC 653 standard application partitioning to make best use of the high speed commercial processors available. The use of standard Application Processor Interface (API) software creates an open software architecture that allows third parties to independently provide software applications also referred to as hosted functions which run within the partitioned operating environment on the GPMs. The intra module communication architecture, (between modules in the IMA) is also based on open standards like Ethernet, Personal Computer Interface (PCI) or VERSA Module Europe (VME), which are also freely available, allowing thirdparty, independent development of the IMA cabinet hardware modules. The Remote Interface Units (RIUs) allow systems with other data networking interfaces to communicate with the IMA. RIUs can interface with ARINC 429, CANBUS, analog and discrete inputs and can be configured to meet specific aircraft requirements. RIUs can be extended to support military specific technologies such as MIL STD 1553 devices which are needed to support the special radios and data link equipment used by the military. Major applications that are typically implemented in the IMA architecture are Communication, Navigation and Surveillance for Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Network Centric Warfare. CNS/ATM applications suitable for hosting in an IMA platform include the Flight Management, Communication Management and Terrain and Traffic Advisories applications. In federated systems these applications are implemented as standalone systems in separate Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). Significant cost savings and flexibility can be achieved by using an IMA approach. Network Centric Warfare applications can also benefit from an IMA approach. Military voice and data link radios can be managed using a function hosted in an IMA platform and controlled using Multipurpose Control Display Units (MCDUs), reducing the number of control panels necessary in the cockpit. Processing of the secure datalink messages can also be performed in the IMA, reducing the cost and LRU count on the aircraft. Information Assurance issues such as data security remain an active topic in the industry, but can be addressed using separate data networks for secure and nonsecure data and data encryption for transmission and storage of secure data to deny unauthorized access. ©2007 IEEE.","","Air traffic management (ATM); Airbus A380; Aircraft designs; Aircraft requirements; Application partitioning; Application processors; ARINC 653; Avionic systems; Boeing 787; Civil transport aircraft; CNS/ATM; Communication , navigation and surveillance (CNS); Communication architectures; Computing platforms; Control display units; Control panels; Cost savings; Data encryption; Data linking; Data networking; Data networks; Data security; Data-links; Development time; Digital avionics; Federated systems; Flight management; Growth potential; Hardware and software; Hardware modules; High speeds; Information assurance (IA); Integrated modular architecture (IMA); Interface units; Intra-module; Line replaceable units (LRU); MIL-STD-1553; Military services; Military transport aircraft; Modular designs; Network Centric Warfare (NCW); Open Software; Open Standards; Operating environment; Processing capabilities; Processing modules; Processing needs; Real time informations; Secure data; Software applications; Stand-alone systems; Surveillance aircraft; Third parties; Traffic Advisory (TA); Voice and data; Aerospace industry; Air navigation; Air traffic control; Aircraft; Aircraft instruments; Application programming interfaces (API); Architecture; Avionics; Cargo aircraft; Cockpits (aircraft); Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Cryptography; Data storage equipment; Digital arithmetic; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Information management; Interfaces (computer); Military aircraft; Military applications; Military aviation; Military operations; Network architecture; Personal computers; Software architecture; Standardization; Standards; Tankers (ships); Trajectories; Transport aircraft; Security of data","","","","","","","undefined, (2008); undefined, (2008); undefined, (2008); Do 297, (2005); Integrated Modular Avionics Hardware Elements, (2002)","","","","BOEING; OBJECTIVE INTERFACE; MITRE","26th DASC Digital Avionics Systems Conference - 4-Dimensional Trajectory-Based Operaions: Impact on Future Avionics and Systems","","","","21557195","1424411084; 9781479950010; 9781424403783; 9781538641125; 9781424440788; 9781665486071; 9781424466160; 9781467316996; 9781665434201; 9781728106496","ADACF","","English","AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-48349133860"

NetOps capabilities include organizations, procedures, and technologies required to manage, defend, and utilize a network. Conventionally NetOps components are regarded as functionally orthogonal and operationally independent. However, based on our experience1 with the future Army tactical network that consist of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), we believe these components should be integrated to enhance NetOps in MANET environments. We envision that with the creation of an over-arching architectural framework to underlie NetOps components, future Army tactical network operations will provide better support to network centric warfare. Also, the focus of NetOps should transition from maintaining network operations to providing optimal communications. In this paper, we describe issues and challenges associated with integrating NetOps components for future Army tactical networks, and discuss path forward. © 2007 IEEE.","","Architectural frameworks; Army tactical networks; Information assurance (IA); Information dissemination management; Issues and challenges; Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs); Network Centric Warfare (NCW); Network defense; Network operations; Transition (Jel Classifications:E52 ,E41 ,E31); Ad hoc networks; Administrative data processing; Information dissemination; Information management; Management information systems; Military applications; Military communications; Military operations; Wireless telecommunication systems; Network management","","","","","","","Proceedings of the Military Communications Conference MILCOM, (2005); Chiang, Cho Yu Jason, AMS: An adaptive middleware system for wireless ad hoc networks, Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM, 2005, (2005); Chiang, Cho Yu Jason, A novel software agent framework with embedded policy control, Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM, 2005, (2005); Chiang, Cho Yu Jason, Performance analysis of DRAMA: A distributed policy-based system for manet management, Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM, (2007); Chiang, Cho Yu Jason, Towards automation of management and planning for future military tactical networks, Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM, (2006); Chiang, Cho Yu Jason, On automated policy generation for mobile ad hoc networks, Proceedings - Eighth IEEE International Workshop on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks, POLICY 2007, pp. 256-260, (2007); Department of Defense Report to Congress, (2001); Global Information Grid, (2004); Farrell, Stephen, When TCP breaks: Delay- and disruption-tolerant networking, IEEE Internet Computing, 10, 4, pp. 72-78, (2006); Proc ACM SIGCOMM, (1997)","","","","","Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2007","","","","21557578","0780393937; 9780780393936; 9781538671856; 9781424415137; 9781424426775; 078030585X; 9780769551241; 0780309537; 9798350374230; 0780306775","PMICE","","English","Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-47949102722"

Also, the framework allows for varying levels of specificity in order to provide important analyses including pinpointing bottlenecks, and providing potential corrections. Furthermore, the framework will allow modeling at different and multiple scales, and allow for decoupling of networks and sub-networks in order to understand and predict performance issues and propagation effects of sub-networks within the NCO/NCW environment. This leads to a much better understanding of and capability to determine and restructure NCO/NCW infrastructures for overall performance, efficiency and efficacy.","Modeling and simulation; Network centric operations; Network centric warfare; Network models; Networking; Performance analysis; Performance prediction; Resource management; Resource modeling","Network centric operations; Network centric warfare; Performance analysis; Performance prediction; Resource modeling; Computer simulation; Electronic crime countermeasures; Information management; Mathematical models; Telecommunication networks; Electronic warfare","","","","","","","Network Centric Warfare Developing and Leveraging Information Superiority, (1999); Tenth International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, (2005); Naval Institute Proceedings, (1998); Ceruti, Marion G., Mobile agents in network-centric warfare, Proceedings - 5th International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems, ISADS 2001, pp. 243-246, (2001); Culler, David E., A practical model of parallel computation, Communications of the ACM, 39, 11, pp. 78-85, (1996); Proc 2003 Fall Simulation Interoperability Workshop, (2003); Proceedings of the Seventeenth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems, (2005); Complexity Theory and Network Centric Warfare, (2003); Muthukrishnan, Gayathri, On simulating hierarchical clusters for performance of ising spin systems, Proceedings of the International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Processing Techniques and Applications, PDPTA'04, 1, pp. 429-434, (2004); Proceedings of the International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Processing Techniques and Applications, (2001)","E.E.

Information delivered too late or with the wrong resolution, form, or precision is insufficient for the user to perform his role in a warfighting scenario. Key characteristics of network-centric warfare environments, as instantiated by the Global Information Grid, are dynamic reconfiguration and interoperability, in which Communities of Interest (COIs) can be formed and reformed dynamically to respond to real-time threats and unfolding situations. There is a need for a QoS management capability that can support the dynamic interoperability and real-time requirements of networkcentric warfare. In order to be effective, this QoS management capability must manage the production, delivery, and consumption of information within available resources, mediate competing demands for resources, and adjust to dynamic conditions. In this paper, we describe the architecture for a QoS Management System (QMS) that works alongside information management systems in dynamic COIs. The QMS provides QoS management (including resource management and quality of information management) in dynamically changing, mission driven environments for interoperating assets within a COI and for assets and resources shared among COIs. The QMS provides mechanisms for QoS policy specification, QoS enforcement and monitoring, dynamic resource allocation, and application adaptation in dynamic COIs. It is based on a layered architecture that maps mission requirements to QoS policies and enforcement. We describe the QMS architecture, prototype implementation, demonstration, and evaluation. Based on these experiences, we also discuss future research directions.","Dynamic and distributed systems; Dynamic interoperability; Network-centric warfare; Quality of information; Quality of service; Real-time; Resource management","Dynamic and distributed systems; Dynamic interoperability; Global Information Grid; Network-centric warfare; Quality of information; Information management; Interoperability; Real time systems; Resource allocation; Software prototyping; Quality of service","","","","","","","10th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, (2005); Afrl Jbi Reference Implementation 1 2 6, (2012); undefined, (2007); undefined, (2007); Eide, Eric N., Dynamic CPU management for real-time, middleware-based systems, Proceedings - IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium, 10, pp. 286-295, (2004); An Architecture for Differentiated Services, (1998); Zhang, Lixia, RSVP: A New Resource ReSerVation Protocol: Novel design features lead to an Internet protocol that is flexible and scalable., IEEE Network, 7, 5, pp. 8-18, (1993); Manghwani, Prakash, End-to-end quality of service management for distributed real-time embedded applications, Proceedings - 19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, IPDPS 2005, 2005, (2005); Proc of the Intl Symp on Dist Objects and Applications Doa 04, (2004); Qt Library","","","","SPIE","Defense Transformation and Net-Centric Systems 2007","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36048992790"

The approach uses the Data Fusion Information Group (DFIG) Fusion hierarchy of Level 0 through Level 4 to fuse the input data into assessments for the enemy target system threats in a battlespace to which military force is being applied. Compact graph models are employed across all levels of the fusion hierarchy to accomplish integrative data fusion and information flow control, as well as cross-layer sensor management. The functional block at each fusion level will have a set of innovative algorithms that not only exploit the corresponding graph model in a computationally efficient manner, but also permit combined functional experiments across levels by virtue of the unifying graphical model approach.","Game theory; Graph theory; Information fusion; Sensor management; Sensor network","Fusion hierarchy; Information flow control; Integrated Fire Control (IFC); Sensor management; Data fusion; Game theory; Graph theory; Information fusion; Knowledge based systems; Sensor networks","","","","","","","Network Centric Warfare Developing and Leveraging Information Superiority, (1999); Understanding Information Age Warfare, (2001); Steinberg, Alan N., Revisions to the JDL Data Fusion Model, Handbook of Multisensor Data Fusion, pp. 2-2-19, (2001); Handbook of Multisensor Data Fusion, (2017); 5 User Refinement Issues Supporting Situation Assessment Reasoning, (2007); Endsley, Mica R., Toward a theory of situation awareness in dynamic systems, Human Factors, 37, 1, pp. 32-64, (1995); Cuppens, Fréd́eric, Alert correlation in a cooperative intrusion detection framework, Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2002-January, pp. 202-215, (2002); Qi, Hairong, Mobile-agent-based collaborative signal and information processing in sensor networks, Proceedings of the IEEE, 91, 8, pp. 1172-1183, (2003); Multitarget Multisensor Tracking Applications and Advances, (2025); Chen, Lei, Distributed data association for multi-target tracking in sensor networks, 2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION, 1, pp. 9-16, (2005)","","","","SPIE","Defense Transformation and Net-Centric Systems 2007","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36048952420"

In such cases, each network node needs to explicitly estimate the performance, trustworthiness and allegiance of all other contributing nodes as a part of the general multi-sensor/multi-target state estimation process. A sensor's or information system's reporting bias - which may include intentional or unintentional human biases - is distinguished from its measurement bias. The problem is compared with that of measurement bias estimation, e.g. in target tracking. Formulations for estimation of biases in discrete variable reporting - e.g. in target classification or activity state reporting - are explored.","Calibration; Closed-loop data fusion; Data alignment; Information warfare; Network-centric operations; Network-centric warfare; Registration; Reporting bias; Sensor/source characterization; Situation assessment; Threat assessment","Data fusion; Estimation; Fusion reactions; Information fusion; Nuclear physics; Sensor networks; Sensors; State estimation; Target tracking; Targets; Calibration; Closed-loop data fusion; Data alignment; Discrete variables; Estimation processes; Information fidelity; Information sources; Information warfare; Interacting agents; International conferences; Measurement bias; Multi sensors; Network nodes; Network-centric operations; Network-centric warfare; Open networks; Registration; Reporting bias; Sensor/source characterization; Situation assessment; Target Classification; Target states; Threat assessment; Time-varying; Sensor data fusion","","","","","","","PC World, (2006); Logic and Conversation, (1967); undefined, (2008); Proceedings Seventh International Conference on Information Fusion, (2004); Steinberg, Alan N., An approach to threat assessment, 2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION, 2, pp. 1256-1263, (2005); Little, Eric G., Ontology meta-model for building a situational picture of catastrophic events, 2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION, 1, pp. 796-803, (2005); Idga Image Fusion Conference, (1999); Torrieri, Don J., Statistical Theory of Passive Location Systems, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, AES-20, 2, pp. 183-198, (1984); Conference, (2001); Lin, Xiangdong, Multisensor Bias Estimation with Local Tracks without a Priori Association, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5204, pp. 334-345, (2004)","A.

Moreover, the problem is highly dynamic in nature in the sense that requirements are changing almost at every moment due to changing situations in the underlying missions, especially in the current age of asymmetric warfare. The resource management problem of today's US military is perhaps the largest and most complex optimization problem in terms of the number of variables representing various resource types and constraints relating the variables. The traditional solution using mass-based hierarchical distribution of resources, applicable to force-on-force conventional warfare, is fast becoming a concept of the past. This modern resource management problem needs to be considered within a network centric warfare (NCW) environment, and hence the term ""sense and respond logistics"" (S&RL). Given this paradigm, the issues of effective communication and coordination among various nodes within a netcentric environment replace the complexity of a centralized and monolithic search problem for traditional resource management. In this talk, I view the resource management issue as intimately related to the problem of planning and scheduling of tasks, that is, one cannot effectively reason with resources in isolation. In the data fusion domain, this view translates to consideration of the collection management process during situationAhreat assessment and courses-of-action generation processes. Within a NCW environment a node must proactively determine mission requirements based on the current situation and threat, and then coordinate with other nodes to meet those requirements via some communication mechanism (e.g. publish and subscribe) on the underlying infrastructure. The specific algorithmic approach I advocate for dynamically managing resources is essentially based on constraint programming (CP) techniques, where constraints are declaratively stated and placed on the types and quantities of resources at hand. The constraints can also be dynamically added or retracted from the system, thus are suitable to meet the demands of a dynamic resource management environment. The approach distinguishes between consumable and non-consumable resources, and in some situations views time as a special kind of resource. Here I illustrate the CP approach to resource management in NCW environments in terms of two examples. The first example is related to surveillance asset management and the second is related to logistics.","Constraint programming; Network centric warfare; Planning & scheduling; Resource management; Sense & respond logistics","Chlorine compounds; Civil defense; Communication; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Coordination reactions; Data fusion; Fusion reactions; Information fusion; Information management; Knowledge management; Management; Military operations; Natural resources management; Nuclear physics; Planning; Production control; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Sensor data fusion; Algorithmic approach; Collection management; Communication mechanisms; Complex optimization problem; Constraint programming; Current situation; Data fusion domain; Dynamic resource management; Effective communications; Hierarchical distribution; International conferences; Managing resources; Mission requirements; Network centric warfare; Planning and scheduling; Resource management; Search problems; US military; Asset management","","","","","","","Naval Institute Proceedings, (1998); Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on AI Robotics and Automation in Space, (2001); Dechter, Rina, Constraint Processing, Constraint Processing, pp. 1-481, (2003); Safe and Sound Artificial Intelligence in Hazardous Applications, (2000); Office of Force Transformation, (2003); Foundations of Constraint Satisfaction, (1993)","S.

Speed of command and decision-making will not only affect the outcome of future battles but drive the outcome of future battles. The Military Transformation Vision for the Department of Defense allows for an increased competitive advantage by creating future concepts of operation that will aid in the speed and effectiveness of defeating future enemy threats. At the core of the transformation vision is the Network Centric Warfare (NCW) concept of high quality shared awareness. NCW will better facilitate both the allocation and application of forces. General Dynamics, under the sponsorship of AFRL/SNR, have completed a series of studies that evaluate the impact of sensor and reference system information and accuracies upon warfighter effectiveness. These studies required a unique simulation methodology that has become, by design, a new M&S tool. This paper introduces this new tool called VECTOR. Consistent with the studies' methodologies, VECTOR leverages other simulations such as the Theater-wide Information Management SIMulation (TRIMSIM) for combining reference errors, GIANT for geometry, navigation errors and weapons effects, and the Global Architecture Combat ID Effectiveness Requirements (GLACIER) tool for the combat ID function. VECTOR considers all reference system position, velocity, attitude, frequency and time (PVAFT) parameters for the complete evaluation of the impact of them on NCW. With future planned upgrades, VECTOR will provide a user with the capability to evaluate and visualize all aspects of an NCW scenario: reference errors, ISR sensor errors, data links, combat ID, and pilot/operation decision rules.","","Network Centric Warfare (NCW); Position, velocity, attitude, frequency and time (PVAFT); Quality shared awareness; VECTOR; Civil defense; Decision making; Electronic warfare; Error analysis; Military operations; Navigation systems; Information retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Navigation - 19th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division, ION GNSS 2006","","","","","","","","English","Proc.

At the heart of this transformation is a new theory of warfare, called Network Centric Warfare (NCW). This new theory can be subdivided into two main sections, infrastructure and operations. Network Centric Infrastructure (NCI) is comprised of all the networks, communications and information management applications required to ""assure delivery"" of data/information to the ""right place at the right time in the right format"". Network Centric Operations (NCO) is the series of processes and applications required by the Commander and staff in order to conduct military operations at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. To fully utilize NCO, the NCI must consist of a robust, adaptable series of services to ensure rapid dependable data/information flow from source to destination. This paper first provides an overview of NCW and its two basic sub-divisions, NCO and NCI. For NCW to be effective, it must be deeply rooted in operational art. Simply applying new technologies to the current platforms, organizations, and doctrine is not enough to fully realize NCW's potential in conducting military operations. To explore this premise, this paper discusses some of the challenges in transforming NCW into a real operational capability within the command and control (C2) environment, utilizing today's offensive and defensive information operations capability. Discussion of C2 applications such as Predictive Battlespace Awareness, Cyber Operations, and a concept called the Situational Awareness Infosphere is presented and how they apply to NCW. Lastly, a detailed example of how the situational awareness infosphere can be applied to space and how it is affected by NCW will be presented along with a corresponding list of technology challenges.1,2.","","Global War on Terrorism (GWOT); Joint Urban Operations (JUO); Network Centric Warfare (NCW); Situational awareness; Information analysis; Information management; Military operations; Command and control systems","","","","","","","undefined, (2007); Network Centric Warfare Developing and Leveraging Information Superiority, (1999); undefined, (2007); undefined, (2007); undefined, (2007); Situation Awareness Analysis and Measurement, (2000); Modeling and Measuring Situation Awareness in the Infantry Operational Environment, (2000); undefined, (2007)","P.W.

This information will lead to better situation awareness so that commanders will be able to act faster and more effectively. However, these benefits are possible only if the sensor data can be fused and synthesized for distribution to the right user in the right form at the right time within the constraints of available bandwidth. In this paper we consider the problem of developing Level 1 data fusion algorithms for disparate fusion in NCW. These algorithms must be capable of operating in a fully distributed (or decentralized) manner; must be able to scale to extremely large numbers of entities; and must be able to combine many disparate types of data. To meet these needs we propose a framework that consists of three main components: an attribute-based state representation that treats an entity state as a collection of attributes, new methods or interpretations of uncertainty, and robust algorithms for distributed data fusion. We illustrate the discussion in the context of maritime domain awareness, mobile adhoc networks, and multispectral image fusion.","Correlated data; Disparate data fusion; Distributed data fusion; Generalized Covariance intersection; MANET; Maritime domain awareness","Algorithms; Bandwidth; Data acquisition; Information dissemination; Multispectral scanners; Sensor data fusion; Data correlation; Disparate data fusion; Distributed data fusion; Generalized Covariance intersection; MANET; Maritime domain awareness; Distributed computer systems","","","","","","","Joint Vision 2020, (2000); Tech Rep, (2003); Grime, S., Data fusion in decentralized sensor networks, Control Engineering Practice, 2, 5, pp. 849-863, (1994); Julier, Simon J., Horizontal model fusion paradigm, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2738, pp. 37-48, (1996); Walters, Joshua J., A software framework for heterogeneous, distributed data fusion, 2006 9th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION, (2006); Proceedings of the 10th Internatoinal Command Control Research and Technology Symposium the Future of C2 Coalition Interoperability, (2005); Blum, Philipp, Improved interval-based clock synchronization in sensor networks, Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, IPSN 2004, pp. 349-358, (2004); Julier, Simon J., Fusion of time delayed measurements with uncertain time delays, Proceedings of the American Control Conference, 6, pp. 4028-4033, (2005); Hurley, Michael B., An information theoretic justification for covariance intersection and its generalization, Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION 2002, 1, pp. 505-511, (2002); Julier, Simon J., An empirical study into the use of Chernoff information for robust, distributed fusion of Gaussian mixture models, 2006 9th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION, (2006)","S.J.

Military organizations are often viewed as the ultimate in rigid hierarchical control. In fact, authority over users and developers is widely distributed, and centralized control is quite difficult - or even impossible, as many of the DoD core functions involve an extended enterprise that includes completely independent entities, such as allied military forces, for-profit corporations, and non-governmental organizations. For this reason, information management within the DoD must take place in an environment of limited autonomy, one in which influence and negotiation are as necessary as top-down direction and control. This presentation examines the DoD's information management problems in the context of its transformation to network-centric warfare The key tenent of NCW holds that ""seamless"" information sharing leads to increased combat power.

To realise the goals of interoperability and shared situation awareness for NCW, it has long been acknowledged that data fusion is a key enabling technology. Typically, however, distributed data fusion, which is relevant to NCW, and the fusion of disparate types of uncertain data, which is relevant to interoperability, have been investigated separately. Ideally, for shared situation awareness, the system should be capable of performing both aspects of data fusion. In this paper, these facets of data fusion are considered in unison for the automatic target identification problem. In particular, novel Bayesian and generalised Bayesian algorithms are formulated for fusing estimates of target identity generated by local heterogeneous data fusion systems in a network, each of which expresses target identity estimates as either finite probability distributions or Dempster-Shafer belief functions. An example drawn from the literature is used to illustrate the algorithms and their relative performances are assessed in the context of the example to identify issues of possible relevance to distributed target identification in a more general setting.

Since, no one sensor can perform well in all the conditions, Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing has been the inherent focus. This paper presents a brief account of the Target Tracking Algorithms developed till date and to be developed in future and brings out the main development trends. As a novel way of presentation, a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix Analysis has been performed and the algorithms have been classified in four classes i.e. Question Marks, Stars, Cash Cows and Dogs. It has been applied to the Radar Target Tracking Algorithms. The evolution and further discussion about future trends clearly show a shift towards Knowledge Based adaptivity and sensor fusion. Though a number of papers have come out bringing complete account of Target Tracking Algorithms but their presentation format does not provide a way of their practical utilization in the system development. The mathematical formulations are complex and mixing is too much for a non-expert or even a system manager to take decisions. Thus a need was felt to provide a suitable format to the decision makers and provide the non-expert a balanced simple account of the algorithms. Further, a knowledge based perspective has been brought out well in this paper. Knowledge Based theme though shown in Target Tracking here is not limited but applies to other areas of radar, ATR, Air Traffic Control & collision avoidance, Network Centric Warfare etc. also.

Referring to IR sensors, integration and fusion of different channels like day/night or SAR images or the ability to spread image data among various users are typical requirements. Looking for concrete implementations the German Army future infantryman IdZ is an example where a group of ten soldiers build a unit with every soldier equipped with a personal digital assistant (PDA) for information display, day photo camera and a high performance thermal imager for every unit. The challenge to allow networked operation among such a unit is bringing information together and distribution over a capable network. So also AIM's thermal reconnaissance and targeting sight HuntIR which was selected for the IdZ program provides this capabilities by an optional wireless interface. Besides the global approach of Network-centric Warfare network technology can also be an interesting solution for digital image data distribution and signal processing behind the FPA replacing analog video networks or specific point to point interfaces. The resulting architecture can provide capabilities of data fusion from e.g. IR dual-band or IR multicolor sensors. AIM has participated in a German/UK collaboration program to produce a demonstrator for day/IR video distribution via Gigabit Ethernet for vehicle applications. In this study Ethernet technology was chosen for network implementation and a set of electronics was developed for capturing video data of IR and day imagers and Gigabit Ethernet video distribution. The demonstrator setup follows the requirements of current and future vehicles having a set of day and night imager cameras and a crew station with several members. Replacing the analog video path by a digital video network also makes it easy to implement embedded training by simply feeding the network with simulation data. The paper addresses the special capabilities, requirements and design considerations of IR sensors and imagers in applications like thermal weapon sights and UAVs for networked operating infantry forces.","FPA; MCT; Non-uniformity correction; Thermal imagers","Cameras; Data acquisition; Image analysis; Image sensors; Infrared devices; Infrared imaging; Personal digital assistants; Synthetic aperture radar; Ethernet; FPA; MCT; Non-uniformity correction; Thermal imagers; Military operations","","","","","","","Cabanski, Wolfgang A., Status of 3rd gen focal plane array IR detection modules at AIM, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5074, pp. 72-82, (2003); Breiter, Rainer, AIM image processing electronics for FPA IR detection modules, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5074, pp. 130-137, (2003); Cabanski, Wolfgang A., Third generation focal plane array IR detection modules and applications, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5783, PART I, pp. 340-349, (2005); Breiter, Rainer, HuntIR thermal imagers for reconnaissance and targeting applications, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 5406, PART 2, pp. 713-721, (2004); Chassande-Mottin, Éric, Uncooled amorphous silicon technology: High performance achievement and future trends, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 4721, pp. 56-63, (2002)","","Andresen, B.F.; Fulop, G.F.","","SPIE - The Interntional Society for Optical Engineering","Infrared Technology and Applications XXXI","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-26444528417"

Propagation of signals from spatially separated radars through differing atmospheric environments, however, can introduce significant errors in target positioning and ranging. For example, simulations illustrate that two radars separated by 100 km viewing the same single target through different tropospheres could place the single target in positions separated by over 200 m. Attempts at fusing the data and resolving the information into a single object could result in operational deficiencies due to classification and discrimination errors. Additionally, anomalous propagation conditions such as tropospheric ducting can lead to radar coverage holes and hence the perception of faulty radars and system level fusion errors. These errors must be characterised and, as far as possible, eliminated if the operational effectiveness of cooperative radar engagements and capabilities are to be optimised. This paper illustrates the type and magnitude of these errors, and their likely impact on system level fusion. The architecture of a potential correction system is outlined. © 2005 IEEE.","Data fusion; Diffraction; Ducting; Radar errors; Refraction","Diffraction; Error analysis; Radar; Refraction; Troposphere; Radar errors; System level fusion; Sensor data fusion","","","","","","","Effects of the Troposphere on Radio Communication, (1979); Propagation of Radiowaves, (2003); Modern Radar System Analysis, (1988); undefined; Proc Climpara, (2001); undefined; Iet, (2000); Sudano, John J., Estimating true altitude of a track from local 3-D Cartesian coordinates of a radar, IEEE Proceedings of the National Aerospace and Electronics Conference, 2, pp. 1014-1017, (1994); undefined, (2004); Bevis, Michael G., GPS meteorology: remote sensing of atmospheric water vapor using the global positioning system, Journal of Geophysical Research, 97, D14, pp. 15-801, (1992)","A.K.

To achieve the important tactical requirement of low probability of intercept (LPI), requires dynamically controlling the emission of platforms. In this paper we propose computationally efficient dynamic emission control and management algorithms for multiple networked heterogenous platforms. By formulating the problem as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) with an on-going multi-armed bandit structure, near optimal sensor management algorithms are developed for controlling the active sensor emission to minimize the threat posed to all the platforms. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate these control/management algorithms. © 2005 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Markov processes; Military operations; Probability; Radar; Sensors; Network centric warfare; Partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP); Sensor networks; Sensor data fusion","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","This work was supported by an NSERC grant, and a British Columbia Advance Systems Institute Grant.","undefined, (2001); Multitarget Multisensor Tracking Principles and Techniques, (1995); Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, (1995); Design and Analysis of Modern Tracking Systems, (1999); Le Cadre, Jean Pierre, Bearings-only tracking for maneuvering sources, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 34, 1, pp. 179-193, (1998); Exact and Approximate Algorithms for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, (1998); undefined, (2005); Proceedings of the 13th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, (1997); Ephraim, Yariv, Hidden Markov processes, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 48, 6, pp. 1518-1569, (2002); Air and Space Power Chronicles, (2002)","V.

The purpose behind the introduction of such concepts is to ""link sensors, engagement systems and decision-makers into an effective and responsive whole, through shared situation awareness, clear procedures and the information connectivity needed to synchronise the actions of the defence farce to meet the commander's intent [1]."" To realise the goal of shared situation awareness for NCW, it has long been acknowledged that decentralised data fusion is a key enabling technology, and to this end it has been investigated in terms of distributed target tracking and identification, and the development of distributed agents and ontologies. However, the aspects of interoperability relating to the fusion of disparate types of uncertain (local) data from joint and coalition data fusion systems for shared situation awareness do not appear to have been reported on in the open literature; fusion of disparate types of uncertain data has only been considered for centralised fusion systems. In this paper, these facets of data fusion are considered in tandem for the automatic target identification problem. In particular, a novel Bayesian technique is described and demonstrated for fusing estimates of target identity generated by local data fusion systems which employ a mix of Bayesian probability and Dempster-Shafer formalisms.","Decentralized data fusion; Disparate uncertainty; Interoperability; Network-centric warfare; Target identification","Algorithms; Decision making; Interoperability; Probability; Research; Sensor data fusion; Decentralized data fusion; Disparate uncertainty; Network-centric warfare (NCW); Target identification; Military operations","","","","","","","Future Warfighting Concept, (2003); Pridmore, J., Interoperability - how do we know when we have achieved it?, IEE Conference Publication, 304, pp. 192-205, (1989); Alouani, Ali T., DISTRIBUTED TARGET TRACKING., Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON, pp. 435-439, (1988); Rao, Bobby S.Y., A Decentralized Bayesian Algorithm for Identification of Tracked Targets, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 23, 6, pp. 1683-1698, (1993); General Decentralized Data Fusion with Covariance Intersection Ci, (2001); Hall, David L., HANDBOOK OF MULTISENSOR DATA FUSION, Handbook of Multisensor Data Fusion, pp. 1-543, (2001); Target Identification Based on the Transferable Belief Model Interpretation of Dempster Shafer Model Part I Methodology and Part II Applications, (2003); Proc Inf Decision Control Conf, (2002); Wang, Xiaoling, Collaborative multi-modality target classification in distributed sensor networks, Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION 2002, 1, pp. 285-290, (2002); Perugini, Don, Distributed information fusion agents, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Information Fusion, FUSION 2003, 1, pp. 86-93, (2003)","M.G.

UE Command Element is responsible for all ground combat operations in the theater. Rapid deployment of ground combat units depends on the effective management of all resources available during early entry in a theater including electrical resources. Electrical power consumers on the future battlefield include complex command posts, vehicles, sensors, communication systems, and decision-making networks that rely on reliable mobile and portable sources of power and energy. With a need to reduce the Army logistics burden, shipping more power devices or fuel are not feasible options. The Army desires a solution replenishing high performance batteries as far forward as possible. Since nearly every C2 system requires electrical power in increasing levels of demand, new technologies and concepts are required to provide command and control systems with adequate electrical power. The challenge is in reducing consumption and providing for efficient distribution of electrical power at all echelons in the Battlespace. This concept is an effort to provide network centric management and information technology to the power sources within the brigade area, as a tactical power grid. This program will provide the commander an information technology backbone within the UE to make better management decisions for power and energy resources including battery charging. The outcome of this concept will improve deployability, reduce the power required to sustain operations, reduce the cost of operations and allow the commander to manage the capability of his unit while engaged in Network Centric Warfare.

Furthermore, decision time has lengthened, not decreased, [1] as more and more sensor data are made available to the commanders -much of which is video in origin. Many efforts are underway to build a network of sensors including the Army's Future Combat System (FCS), Air Force Multi-mission Command and Control Aircraft (MC2A), Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT), and the follow-on to the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC). Each of these (and still other) programs has the potential to increase precision of the targeting data with successful correlation algorithms while eliminating dual track reports, but almost none have combined or will combine disparate sensor data into a cohesive target with a high confidence of identification. In this paper, we address an architecture that solves the track correlation problem using frequency plane pattern recognition techniques that also can provide CID capability. Also, we discuss statistical considerations and performance issues.","Fusion; Generalized noise; Phase invariance; Sensor registration; Track correlation","Algorithms; Approximation theory; Correlation methods; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Military operations; Pattern recognition; Probability density function; Random processes; Range finding; Signal filtering and prediction; Tracking (position); Phase invariance; Sensor registration; Target identification; Sensor data fusion","","","","","","","Colonel Ret Usaf, (2004); Network Centric Warfare Conference, (2001); Stanek, Clay J., Imaged-based topology for sensor gridlocking and association, Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering, 4726, pp. 328-342, (2002); Stanek, Clay J., Filter construction for topological track association and sensor registration, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 4789, pp. 186-202, (2002); Proceedings from the Workshop on Tracking Estimation and Fusion A Tribute to Bar Shalom, (2001); undefined, (2004); Bayesian Methods General Background an Introductory Tutorial, (1996); Probability Theory as Logic Hypothesis Testing, (1994); Introduction to Statistical Pattern Recognition, (1990); Course Notes in Pattern Recognition, (2005)","","Sadjadi, F.A.","","SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","PROCEEDINGS OF SPIE SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering: Automatic Target Recognition XIII","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0344983827"

In this paper we describe the use of Image Differencing and 3D terrain database editing in order to fuse oblique aerial photos, IR sensor imagery, and other non-traditional data sources to produce battlefield metrics that support network centric operations. Such metrics include target detection, recognition, and location, and improved knowledge of the target environment. Key to our approach is the rapid generation of target and background signatures from high-resolution 1-meter object descriptor terrain databases. This technique utilizes the difference between measured and calculated sensor images to update and correct knowledge of the terrain background, register multi sensor imagery identify potential/candidate targets based on residual image differencing and measure and report target locations based on scene matching. The technique is especially suited for utilizing imagery from reconnaissance and remotely piloted vehicle sensors. It also holds promise for automation and real-time data reduction of battlefield sensor feeds and for improving now-time situational awareness.

What began as theoretical thinking, under the notion of a Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) is now beginning to manifest itself in a ""Transformation."" The overall goal of the transformation described in Joint Vision 2020 is the creation of a force that is dominant across the full spectrum of military operations. The warfighting concept that will allow us to achieve Joint Vision 2020 operational capabilities is Network Centric Warfare (NCW). NCW is no less than the embodiment of an Information Age transformation of the DoD. It involves a new way of thinking about how we accomplish our missions, how we organize and interrelate, and how we acquire, field and use the systems that support us. It will involve ways of operating that have yet to be conceived, and it will employ technologies yet to be invented. NCW has the potential to increase warfighting capabilities by orders of magnitude, and it will do so by leveraging information superiority. A major condition to success is an infrastructure that is robustly networked to support information collection, sharing and collaboration; which will require increased emphasis on sensor research, development and implementation. DARPA is taking steps today to research, develop and implement those sensor capabilities. The Multi-Body Control program is a step in that direction.","Future warfare; Network-centric warfare; Science and technology directions; Sensor grids; Sensor networks; Transformation; Value-added command and control","Command and control systems; Information technology; Military operations; Sensor data fusion; Telecommunication networks; Sensor grids; Sensor networks; Value-added command and control; Signal processing","","","","","","","IEEE Spectrum, (1997); Parameters, (2001); Army A L T Journal, (2000); Naval Institute Proceedings, (1998); Transformation Trends, (2000); Army Al T Journal 7, (2000); Department of Industrial Engineering, (2001); Strategy and the Revolution in Military Affairs from Theory to Policy, (1995); American Army Doctrine for the Post Cold War, (1997); Fcs C2 Experiment 2 Initial Insights, (2002)","","","SPIE","SPIE - International Society for Optical Engineering","Advanced Signal Processing Algorithms, Architectures, and Implementations","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1842607735"

A self-consistent context will allow the combat systems engineer a framework for allocating ""system"" combat control functions at the unit level, as well as ""system-of-system"" command and control functions at the battle force level. This paper will recommend the use of a context used for many years by the Navy to describe an engagement or mission sequence: detect, control, and engage (DCE). It will be shown that DCE has as its foundation the observe, orient, decide, act (OODA) loop developed by Colonel John Boyd in the mid-1980s. Using the OODA-based DCE sequence, as well as the Department of Defense Joint Directors of Laboratories' (JDL) Data Fusion Model, a unit- and force-level context can be developed for the tactical decision-making process and allocation of system functions. Further, the DCE sequence can be extended to the force level within the framework of network centric warfare introduced by VAdm.

Network Centric Warfare is a current US Navy initiative to leverage the power of the computer to restructure forces from the bottom up. Instead of a strict hierarchy where decisions are pushed down, networked warfighters will cooperatively pursue the strategic goals of the commander in a much more decentralized fashion. Essential to the idea of Network Centric Warfare is the proliferation of ever-present information systems, or ubiquitous computing capabilities, where the computer (or rather, the networked computing capability) is no longer the focus of human attention, but rather, becomes invisible.

Besides the necessary requirement of information exchange networks with sufficient bandwidth and computational power to treat the data being passed around the network; algorithms are required to make sense of the data. It is estimation algorithms that turn the straw (data) into gold (information). Both proper execution and improvements in estimation algorithms are the enabling technology that facilitates the formation and usage of data across the envisioned warfare networks.

We also discuss how these requirements focus the design of potentially new algorithms.

The vision of the SSW is an intelligent, web-centric distribution and fusion of sensor information that provides greatly enhanced local situational awareness, on demand, to warfighters at lower echelons (battalion/squadron and below). The project examined critical technical issues associated with developing such a system in a joint operational context, including Army, Marine, Air Force and SOF elements. Key constraints in an SSW system include energy, communications bandwidth, latency, and information presentation. This analysis is focused on information generation as far forward as possible to minimize bandwidth requirements and maximize the use of continually improving processing and memory capability. It also focuses on the problem of information fusion and presentation, ensuring that only mission relevant and understandable information is presented to the warfighter. The key mechanism for addressing these concepts is the SSW test bed, a combination of virtual and live assets. Two operational vignettes were used during the second experiment using the test bed: (1) dismounted infantry conducting operations on urban terrain, and (2) the employment of wide-area search munitions such as the Air Force's Low Cost Autonomous Attack System (LOCAAS) in a cooperative attack environment. This paper will focus on the concept for the experiment, some of the key technical issues addressed, the interplay of the simulation methods used, and results from the final live experiment conducted in January 2002. © Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","Military operations on urban terrain; Network centric warfare; Sensor integration; Wireless internet","Bandwidth compression; Computer simulation; Computer supported cooperative work; Military communications; Sensor data fusion; Virtual reality; Wireless telecommunication systems; World Wide Web; Low cost autonomous attack systems; Sensor integration; Smart sensor web; Urban terrain operations; Military electronic countermeasures","","","","","","","Improved Application of Intelligence on the Battlefield, (1996)","","","","","","","","","0277786X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510699663; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510691001; 9781510690844; 9781510691469","","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036439056"

The current C2 as well as the sensor suite of the HALIFAX Class were designed in the early 80s. For its time, the ship C2 architecture was both revolutionary and advanced. It has fully integrated and distributed C2, capable of combining information from all the data sources available on the frigate and presenting this information to all operators responsible for various sensor/weapon management and control taskS. While this system is very capable of supporting modern warfare, it is apparent that it must evolve to keep up with the advancements in threat and sensor technologies as well as to be able to cope with the increased information flow in a Network Centric Warfare.
