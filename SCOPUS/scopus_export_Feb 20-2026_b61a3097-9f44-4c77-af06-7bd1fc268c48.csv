This systematic mapping study analyzes many BDA architectures proposed in the literature, revealing a fragmented landscape in which the proposed architectures are largely conceptual with limited industrial validation. Our analysis identifies dominant technological patterns, such as Apache Kafka for ingestion, Spark for processing, and Hadoop and Hive for storage, with the majority of implementations favoring open-source solutions. Despite their theoretical importance, real-time analytics capabilities remain underutilized in practice. This study synthesizes a unified conceptual reference architecture with eight fundamental layers to provide a framework for comparative analysis. We document an imbalance in layer development: storage and processing receive comprehensive attention while querying, infrastructure management, and monitoring layers remain underdeveloped. Implementation approaches show distinct patterns in deployment strategies and data handling, with structured and semi-structured data well supported, whereas unstructured data integration presents ongoing challenges. Future research should focus on developing standardized modular frameworks, benchmarking methodologies, and integrating modern data lakehouse architectures to bridge the gap between theoretical proposals and production-ready systems. © 2013 IEEE.","Big data analytics (BDA); cyber-physical systems (CPS); data lake; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Industry 4.0; smart manufacturing","Advanced Analytics; Architecture; Benchmarking; Big data; Computer architecture; Data assimilation; Data integration; Decision making; Digital storage; Information management; Lakes; Smart manufacturing; 'current; Big data analytic; Cybe-physical system; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data analytics; Data lake; Industrial internet of thing; Systematic evaluation; Industry 4.0","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (00x0ma614)","This work was supported by the Coordena\u00E7\u00E3o de Aperfei\u00E7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00EDvel Superior (CAPES) (Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifier: 00x0ma614) for the Article Processing Charge.","Nain, Garima, Towards edge computing in intelligent manufacturing: Past, present and future, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 62, pp. 588-611, (2022); Ikegwu, Anayo Chukwu, Big data analytics for data-driven industry: a review of data sources, tools, challenges, solutions, and research directions, Cluster Computing, 25, 5, pp. 3343-3387, (2022); Saeed, Nimra, Incorporating big data and IoT in intelligent ecosystems: state-of-the-arts, challenges and opportunities, and future directions, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 83, 7, pp. 20699-20741, (2024); Proc Int Conf NDE, (2023); Belhadi, Amine, Understanding Big Data Analytics for Manufacturing Processes: Insights from Literature Review and Multiple Case Studies, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 137, (2019); Ismail, Ahmed, Manufacturing process data analysis pipelines: a requirements analysis and survey, Journal of Big Data, 6, 1, (2019); Sahal, Radhya, Big data and stream processing platforms for Industry 4.0 requirements mapping for a predictive maintenance use case, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 54, pp. 138-151, (2020); Sawadogo, Pegdwendé, On data lake architectures and metadata management, Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 56, 1, pp. 97-120, (2021); J Manuf Syst, (2022); Petersen, Kai, Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering: An update, Information and Software Technology, 64, pp. 1-18, (2015)","A.R.

In these fields, data are typically diverse in format and subject. Consequently, challenges in storing, tracking, and responsibly sharing valuable data have become increasingly evident over the past decades. To address the complexities, some approaches have leveraged standard strategies, such as using non-relational databases and data warehouses. However, these approaches often fall short in providing the flexibility and scalability required for complex projects. While the data lake paradigm has emerged to offer flexibility and handle large volumes of diverse data, it lacks robust data governance and organization. The data lakehouse is a new paradigm that combines the flexibility of a data lake with the governance of a data warehouse, offering a promising solution for managing heterogeneous data in bioinformatics. However, the lakehouse model remains unexplored in bioinformatics, with limited discussion in the current literature. In this study, we review strategies and tools for developing a data lakehouse infrastructure tailored to bioinformatics research. We summarize key concepts and assess available open-source and commercial solutions for managing data in bioinformatics.

This shift has enabled deeper integration of AI/ML, allowing for more nuanced insights and improved decision-making. The rise of Data Lakes and Lakehouse architectures allows organizations to manage structured and unstructured data more efficiently. However, these advancements bring challenges, including managing data governance, ensuring security, controlling costs, and addressing the skills gap in emerging technologies.

They also focus on data quality to guarantee the accuracy of analyses, and on reliable governance to ensure data compliance, security and traceability. These aspects are essential to enable optimal use of data for advanced analysis and informed decision-making in healthcare. Our objective in this article is to propose an architecture that ensures the 3 points: integration, storage and governance. The article proposes the DLMF architecture to ensure that these 3 points are adapted to good data analysis. This architecture uses the concept of a data lake for the consolidation and storage of data sources, a data mesh and a data fabric to ensure everything to do with data integration, quality and governance. The article also proposes a set of open-source technologies for its implementation.

A key customer requirement for BigQuery centers around the unification of data lake and enterprise data warehousing workloads. This approach combines: (1) the need for core data management primitives, e.g., security, governance, common runtime metadata, performance acceleration, ACID transactions, provided by an enterprise data warehouses coupled with (2) harnessing the flexibility of the open source format and analytics ecosystem along with new workload types such as AI/ML over unstructured data on object storage. In addition, there is a strong requirement to support BigQuery as a multi-cloud offering given cloud customers are opting for a multi-cloud footprint by default. This paper describes BigLake, an evolution of BigQuery toward a multi-cloud lakehouse to address these customer requirements in novel ways. We describe three main innovations in this space. We first present BigLake tables, making open-source table formats (e.g., Apache Parquet, Iceberg) first class citizens, providing fine-grained governance enforcement and performance acceleration over these formats to BigQuery and other open-source analytics engines. Next, we cover the design and implementation of BigLake Object tables that allow BigQuery to integrate AI/ML for inferencing and processing over unstructured data. Finally, we present Omni, a platform for deploying BigQuery on non-GCP clouds, focusing on the infrastructure and operational innovations we made to provide an enterprise lakehouse product regardless of the cloud provider hosting the data. © 2024 Owner/Author.","data lake; data warehousing; multi-cloud analytics; unstructured data","Cloud analytics; Data handling; Digital storage; Information management; Lakes; Sales; Sea ice; Customer need; Customer requirements; Data lake; Google+; Multi-cloud analytic; Multi-clouds; Open-source; Performance acceleration; Spectra's; Unstructured data; Data warehouses","","","","","","","Apache Hudi, (2023); Apache Iceberg the Open Table Format for Analytic Datasets, (2023); Apache Parquet, (2023); Container Optimized Os, (2023); Google Cloud Dataproc, (2023); Google Infrastructure Security, (2023); Spark Bigquery Connector, (2023); Slsa Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts, (2023); Tensorflow Large Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, (2015); Armbrust, Michael, Delta Lake: High-Performance ACID Table Storage over Cloud Object Stores, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 13, 12, pp. 3411-3424, (2020)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGMOD","2024 International Conference on Management of Data, SIGMOD 2024","2024-06-09 through 2024-06-15","Santiago","200185","07308078","0897910400; 9781450330121; 0897913175; 0897914252; 9781581139020; 9781450343190; 9781450341929; 158113908X; 0897910737; 9781450367974","","","English","Proc.

Unlike typical data warehouses, which need data structure for storage, data lakes allow you to store raw data in its natural state. This adaptability makes data lakes suitable for storing large volumes of various data kinds, including photographs, videos, log files, sensor data, and others. When integrating a data lake with Power Business Intelligence (BI), organizations can harness the power of both technologies to gain valuable insights from their data. In the realm of data-driven decision-making, organizations face the challenge of managing and extracting insights from vast and diverse datasets, a task conventional on-premises storage solutions often struggle with due to the exponential growth of data. Thus, the adoption of more scalable and flexible alternatives becomes imperative. Cloud-based data lakes emerge as transformative solutions, offering unparalleled scalability, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and advanced security protocols. This paper discuss the concept of constructing a cloud-based data lake optimized for Power BI, leveraging leading cloud storage services like Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) and Amazon S3. By seamlessly integrating Power BI with the cloud data lake, organizations can overcome traditional storage limitations and reap numerous benefits. The practical applications in advanced analytics, customer insights, IoT data management, and data discovery underscore the real-world utility of cloud data lakes. The integration of Power BI with a cloud data lake augments efficient data analysis and self-service analytics potential, offering organizations a comprehensive solution for deriving actionable insights from their data assets. © 2024 IEEE.","Cloud data integration; Cloud storage; Data flows; Data Lake; Power BI","Data integration; Data warehouses; Business-intelligence; Cloud data; Cloud data integration; Cloud storage services; Cloud storages; Cloud-based; Data lake; Dataflow; Power; Power business intelligence; Decision making","","","","","","","Tovernic, Silvia, Solution for detecting sensitive data inside a data lake, 2018 41st International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2018 - Proceedings, pp. 1284-1288, (2018); Examining Cloud Computing Technologies Through the Internet of Things, (2018); Design of A Data Lake Architecture for the Healthcare Use Case Problems and Solutions, (2025); Cuzzocrea, Alfredo, Big data lakes: Models, frameworks, and techniques, Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing, BigComp 2021, pp. 1-4, (2021); Nambiar, Athira M., An Overview of Data Warehouse and Data Lake in Modern Enterprise Data Management, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 6, 4, (2022); Eder, Johann, Data quality for federated medical data lakes, International Journal of Web Information Systems, 17, 5, pp. 407-426, (2021); Ramchand, Sonam, Big data architectures for data lakes: A systematic literature review, Proceedings - 2022 IEEE 46th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2022, pp. 1141-1146, (2022); International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology Irjet, (2020); Data Lake Development with Big Data, (2015); Big Data Analyses Services and Smart Data, (2021)","V.V.

The data warehouses are implemented to integrate structured datasets. A data lake provides storing capabilities for unstructured data. Nowadays, the two concepts are integrated in data lakehouse platforms that provide facilities for structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. The open-source framework for managing and processing huge amounts of data Hadoop is observed. More precisely, the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) organization is discussed.

The goal is to ingest both structured and unstructured data through a pipeline and perform predictive analytics on the information. CSPs offer individual services for storage, processing, and analytics, and due to the repetitive nature of big data processing, these workflows are available as managed or open-source orchestration services. Stream and batch processing services are specialized for handling real-time unbounded stream data and large volumes of data that need to be processed batch-wise and stored in data lakes and warehouses. We analyze the services and data management patterns and pipelines from leading CSPs such as Amazon, Google, and Azure. The comparative study aims to provide various stakeholders of big data from data analysts to data scientists and novice researchers knowledge of the various options available and to aid in designing a cost-effective and efficient solution for any analytics application.

Maritime data is growing at an unprecedented rate, with terabytes of marine data being collected every month and petabytes of data already being made public. Heterogeneous marine data collected through various devices can be used in various fields such as environmental protection, defect prediction, transportation route optimization, and energy efficiency. However, it is difficult to manage vessel related data due to high heterogeneity of such marine big data. Additionally, due to the high heterogeneity of these data sources and some of the challenges associated with big data, such applications are still underdeveloped and fragmented. In this paper, we propose the Vessel Data Lakehouse architecture consisting of the Vessel Data Lake layer that can handle marine big data, the Vessel Data Warehouse layer that supports marine big data processing and AI, and the Vessel Application Services layer that supports marine application services. Our proposed a Vessel Data Lakehouse that can efficiently manage heterogeneous vessel related data. It can be integrated and managed at low cost by structuring various types of heterogeneous data using an open source-based big data framework. In addition, various types of vessel big data stored in the Data Lakehouse can be directly utilized in various types of vessel analysis services.

Modern investors use variety of tools to take informed investment decisions. In the current era of digital world, financial service industry has generated huge volume and immense verities of data with extreme speed. Due to the rapid growth in data collection and the heterogeneous nature and complexity of the data, there is a need for Big Data analytical solution that would be able to deal with the stock market data. Large volumes of unstructured, heterogeneous raw data can be stored in a massively scalable manner using data lakes, which are the ideal solution to the big data storage conundrum. The ability of a data lake to preserve data in its original format while processing it at runtime using a schema on-read technique is its key feature. The challenge faced in the data lake is performing analytics which is a significant tool to calculate and analyze the stock market. The proposed architecture of Azure Databricks DeltaLake (ADDL) with Azure DataLake Storage Generation 2 (ADLSG2) is used for analytical processes like Fibonacci retracement for better stock analysis, which aid in forecasting the market price for better investment. As a result, the research focus is to produce a storage having read as well as write capabilities by taking into consideration the Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) operation on the datasource. In this experimental databricks implementation, runtime is performed using open source of Apache Spark API and a highly improved execution engine, which results in a significant performance improvement when comparing to the standard source of Apache Spark available on the ADLS platform. Additionally, the Fibonacci retracement level calculation is achieved with the analytics and forecasting of test close price with various ML and DL techniques such as KNN, LSTM are compared with original price of the test data for better prediction of forecast close price. © 2023 IEEE.","ADLSG2; Apache spark; Big data analytics; Databricks Delta Lake; ELT; Fibonacci retracement; LSTM; stock market","Advanced Analytics; Commerce; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Lakes; Long short-term memory; Apache spark; Azure datalake storage generation 2; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Databrick delta lake; Extract-load-transform; Fibonacci retracement; Load transform; LSTM; Runtimes; Big data","","","","","","","Chong, Dazhi, Big data analytics: a literature review, Journal of Management Analytics, 2, 3, pp. 175-201, (2015); Russian Technological Journal, (2021); Cappa, Francesco, Big Data for Creating and Capturing Value in the Digitalized Environment: Unpacking the Effects of Volume, Variety, and Veracity on Firm Performance*, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 38, 1, pp. 49-67, (2021); Yang, Chaowei Phil, Big Data and cloud computing: innovation opportunities and challenges, International Journal of Digital Earth, 10, 1, pp. 13-53, (2017); Itm Web Conf, (2018); Big Data Fast Data and Data Lake Concepts, (2016); Ilin, Dmitry Yu, Performance Analysis of Software with a Variant NoSQL Data Schemes, Proceedings of 2020 13th International Conference Management of Large-Scale System Development, MLSD 2020, (2020); Sawadogo, Pegdwendé, Metadata Systems for Data Lakes: Models and Features, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1064, pp. 440-451, (2019); Armbrust, Michael, Delta Lake: High-Performance ACID Table Storage over Cloud Object Stores, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 13, 12, pp. 3411-3424, (2020); Data Lake Architecture Designing the Data Lake and Avoiding the Garbage Dump, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 International Conference on Self Sustainable Artificial Intelligence Systems, ICSSAS 2023","2023-10-18 through 2023-10-20","Erode","195071","","9798350300857","","","English","Int.

However, since the data is generally created utilizing liberal curation approaches such as crowd-sourcing and automatic extraction tools with no cross-validation on input data, the data is prone to errors that can be hidden in several dimensions. The types of errors which can be considered as outliers may occur in any part of RDF statements, especially in literal objects. Although some scientific studies have revealed anomalies in knowledge graphs, none of the current approaches has the ability to explain the anomalies that have been discovered. In this paper, we present ExPAD, a scalable and distributed framework for explainable numeric anomaly detection on very large RDF knowledge graphs. Inspired by OutlierTree, ExPAD generates human-readable explanations for a given numeric result being an outlier by following and assessing supervised decision tree splits. The proposed framework ExPAD is open-source, well-documented, and fully integrated into the Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA). Experiments on real-world use cases and synthetic datasets disclose that the framework can not only handle high volumes of RDF data but also efficiently generate explanations for hidden anomalies discovered in KGs. © 2023 IEEE.","Big Data; Decision Tree; Distributed Computing; Explainable Anomaly Detection; RDF; SANSA","Big data; Decision trees; Knowledge graph; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantics; Statistics; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection frameworks; Curation; Explainable anomaly detection; Heterogeneous data; Knowledge graphs; RDF; RDF data; Semantic analytic stack; Semantic-analytics","","","","","Horizon 2020, (872592)","This work was partly supported by the EU Horizon 2020 project PLATOON (GA no. 872592).","Identification of Outliers, (1980); Chandola, Varun, Anomaly detection: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 41, 3, (2009); A Roadmap to the Semantic Web, (1998); Vrandečič, Denny, Wikidata: A new platform for collaborative data collection, WWW'12 - Proceedings of the 21st Annual Conference on World Wide Web Companion, (2012); Auer, Sören, DBpedia: A nucleus for a Web of open data, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 4825 LNCS, pp. 722-735, (2007); Aaai, (2015); Explainable Outlier Detection Through Decision Tree Conditioning, (2020); Lehmann, Jens F., Distributed semantic analytics using the SANSA stack, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 10588 LNCS, pp. 147-155, (2017); Sansa Team, (2022); Interpretable Machine Learning, (2019)","F.B.

It stores both transaction log and data files in one directory, and provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing on top of existing data lakes, such as S3, ADLS, GCS, and HDFS. Different from data warehouses, delta lakes allow data to be stored in the original format, retain complete data information, and provide efficient and low-cost storage solutions for data computing and analysis businesses. However, Since Delta Lake metadata is scattered in different resource files, the lack of a unified metadata view increases the difficulty of data governance. Also, Delta Lake adopts an open source storage system as the underlying storage, and its basic access control does not isolate different users, which may lead the risk of data leakage. At present, most common storage systems use data tables' row and column fields for access control, while delta lake treats the file group as an object. In this paper, aiming at the difficulty of data governance, we design a data lake metadata management method to achieve unified and efficient management of metadata information in heterogeneous data. Then, we design a policy-based data lake access control mechanism, combined with the open source permission framework, and complete the access request for different users and roles in Delta Lake. © 2022 IEEE.","Access Control; Data Lake; Delta Lake; Metadata","Access control; Batch data processing; Big data; Data warehouses; Digital storage; Information management; Metadata; Open systems; Access control systems; Data governances; Data lake; Data storage; Delta lake; Open-source; Policy based access control; Storage solutions; Storage systems; Transaction log; Lakes","","","","","(BA2021007); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62072099); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants No. 62072099, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Network and Information Security under Grants No.BM2003201, Jiangsu Provincial Scientific and Technological Achievements Transfer Fund (Grant No. BA2021007), Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration of Ministry of Education of China under Grants No.93K-9, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","Ouellette, Paul, Ronin: Data lake exploration, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 14, 12, pp. 2863-2866, (2021); Ravat, Franck, Data Lakes: Trends and Perspectives, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 11706 LNCS, pp. 304-313, (2019); Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, (2020); Ramakrishnan, Raghu, Azure Data Lake Store: A hyperscale distributed file service for big data analytics, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, Part F127746, pp. 51-63, (2017); Ramya, P., SecDedoop: Secure Deduplication with Access Control of Big Data in the HDFS/Hadoop Environment, Big Data, 8, 2, pp. 147-163, (2020); Chen, Congwei, HBD-Authority: Streaming Access Control Model for Hadoop, Proceedings - 2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud and Big Data Systems and Application, DependSys 2020, pp. 16-25, (2020); Uniform Access to Multiform Data Lakes Using Semantic Technologies 2019 C Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Information Integration and Web Based Applications Services Iiwas 19; Nargesian, Fatemeh, Organizing Data Lakes for Navigation, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1939-1950, (2020); Zhang, Yi, Finding Related Tables in Data Lakes for Interactive Data Science, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1951-1966, (2020); Bogatu, Alex, Dataset discovery in data lakes, Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering, 2020-April, pp. 709-720, (2020)","Z.

Besides, medical data contains essential information that contributes to data exploration. However, the existing platforms based on Data Warehouse or Data Lake cannot effectively integrate more comprehensive multi-source heterogeneous medical data and efficiently manage large-scale multi-modal medical data. This paper presents a Multi-source Heterogeneous Data of Medical Lakehouse (MHDML), the platform that integrates multiple pieces of open-source software reasonably to integrate more comprehensive multi-source heterogeneous medical data. Multi-modal data fusion is an important method of the platform to improve multi-modal data management in the medical field. Finally, we customize Restful APIs for medical data exploration tasks. Based on the real data of sepsis and knee osteoarthritis, the platform realizes more comprehensive multi-source heterogeneous medical data acquisition and effective multi-modal medical data management, providing simple operations and visual data exploration functions for medical staff. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data exploration; Medical lakehouse; Multi-modal data management; Multi-source heterogeneous data","Data acquisition; Data fusion; Data warehouses; Human resource management; Metadata; Modal analysis; Open source software; Open systems; Data exploration; Heterogeneous data; Medical data; Medical fields; Medical lakehouse; Multi-modal; Multi-modal data; Multi-modal data management; Multi-source heterogeneous data; Multi-Sources; Information management","","","","","(2019GGJS040, 2020GGJS027); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020AAA0109603)","Acknowledgements.

This has resulted in vast amounts of data becoming available in a variety of forms and formats including RDF. As RDF data have been created by liberal curation methods (e.g. crowd-sourcing and automatic extraction tools with limited restriction and cross-validation on input data), they are prone to various kinds of errors that can be hidden in different dimensions (i.e. subject, predicate, and object level). Detecting those errors not only improves the KGs quality but also makes it possible to detect anomalous events in the data which can be used for subsequent analysis. In this paper, we present DistAD, a generic, scalable, and distributed framework for anomaly detection on large RDF knowledge graphs. DistAD provides a great granularity for the end-users to select from a vast number of different algorithms, methods, and (hyper-)parameters to detect outliers. The proposed framework is fully open-source, well-documented, and fully integrated into the active community project Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA). The experiments on real-world use cases disclose that the framework is not only able to handle huge RDF data but also able to successfully detect hidden anomalies/outliers in KGs. © 2022 IEEE.","Anomaly Detection; Big Data; Distributed Computing; RDF Graph; SANSA; Scalable Analytics","Big data; Object detection; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantics; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection frameworks; Data generation; Data maintenance; Heterogeneous data; RDF data; RDF graph; Scalable analytic; Semantic analytic stack; Semantic-analytics","","","","","Horizon 2020; (872592)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partly supported by the EU Horizon 2020 project PLATOON (GA no. 872592).

More concretely, we propose a data model made of both textual and CSV documents, a workload model composed of a set of various tasks, as well as a set of performance-based metrics, all relevant to the context of data lakes.

These data management challenges are largely posed by the availability of streaming data at high velocity from various sources in multiple formats. The changes in data paradigm have led to the emergence of new data analytics and management architecture. This paper focuses on storing high volume, velocity and variety data in the raw formats in a data storage architecture called a data lake. First, we present our study on the limitations of traditional data warehouses in handling recent changes in data paradigms. We discuss and compare different open source and commercial platforms that can be used to develop a data lake. We then describe our end-to-end data lake design and implementation approach using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on the Hadoop Data Platform (HDP). Finally, we present a real-world data lake development use case for data stream ingestion, staging, and multilevel streaming analytics which combines structured and unstructured data. This study can serve as a guide for individuals or organizations planning to implement a data lake solution for their use cases. © 2020 IEEE.","Hadoop Data Platform; Hadoop Distributed File System; NiFi; streaming data; unstructured data","Advanced Analytics; Architecture; Big data; Data Analytics; Data streams; Data warehouses; Digital storage; File organization; Lakes; Data management challenges; Design and implementations; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); Large organizations; Management architectures; Multi-level streaming; Streaming data; Unstructured data; Information management","","","","","Ontario Centres of Excellence, OCE; IBM Canada","ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to express a special thanks to the Southern Ontario Smart Computing for Innovation Platform (SOSCIP), Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE) and IBM Canada for supporting this research.","Artificial Intelligence Review, (2019); Ravat, Franck, Data Lakes: Trends and Perspectives, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 11706 LNCS, pp. 304-313, (2019); Fang, Huang, Managing data lakes in big data era: What's a data lake and why has it became popular in data management ecosystem, 2015 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control and Intelligent Systems, IEEE-CYBER 2015, pp. 820-824, (2015); Hai, Rihan, Constance: An intelligent data lake system, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, 26-June-2016, pp. 2097-2100, (2016); IBM Industry Model Support for A Data Lake Architecture, (2016); Mehmood, Hassan, Implementing big data lake for heterogeneous data sources, Proceedings - 2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops, ICDEW 2019, pp. 37-44, (2019); Oussous, Ahmed, Big Data technologies: A survey, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 30, 4, pp. 431-448, (2018); Top 7 Challenges of Building A Data Lake, (2017); Hadoop Apache Project, (2008); Practical Data Science with Hadoop and Spark Designing and Building Effective Analytics at Scale, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Practices, IBDAP 2020","2020-09-25 through 2020-09-26","Bangkok","164855","","9781728181066","","","English","Int.

Because of low memory price, system distribution and failure tolerance, that storage is typically HDFS. It enables users to manipulate data with different tools from the Hadoop ecosystem. The process of data ingestion seems simple. However, because sources can be different database systems, structured, semi-structured and unstructured data complicate the ingestion procedure. It is usually not enough to just store everything. Data needs to be stored in such a way that enables users to quickly access and manipulate it. There are many ingestion-specific solutions in the big data ecosystem. This paper will describe an implemented system for data ingestion from MSSQL, MySQL and Postgres into a Hive database. The process starts with creating tables with corresponding metadata, continues with the ingestion process and ends with a description of how the process is automated. The implementation of Sqoop as an open-source tool and Hue, a web user interface from Cloudera, will be described. © 42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.
