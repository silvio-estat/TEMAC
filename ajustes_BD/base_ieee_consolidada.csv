In these scenarios, Shared Situational Awareness (SSA) plays a critical role. This paper examines the challenges of these incidents, emphasizing the prevalence of human error and the limitations of traditional fire detection and coordination methods. It applies Endsley's three-level model of Situational Awareness (SA) and proposes a model for SSA development specific to such emergencies. The Overheat Project is introduced, highlighting the development of a Digital Solution (DS) to address enhanced SSA through real-time data integration and a collaborative platform. This platform connects vessels and on-shore data systems, providing a common operational picture (COP) for all stakeholders involved in fire response. The architecture of the DS is described, outlining the onboard and ground-based components that facilitate seamless data exchange.

Because of low memory price, system distribution and failure tolerance, that storage is typically HDFS. It enables users to manipulate data with different tools from the Hadoop ecosystem. The process of data ingestion seems simple. However, because sources can be different database systems, structured, semi-structured and unstructured data complicate the ingestion procedure. It is usually not enough to just store everything. Data needs to be stored in such a way that enables users to quickly access and manipulate it. There are many ingestion-specific solutions in the big data ecosystem. This paper will describe an implemented system for data ingestion from MSSQL, MySQL and Postgres into a Hive database.

Data Lake Architecture for Storing and Transforming Web Server Access Log Files,E. Zagan; M. Danubianu,"Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ştefan cel Mare University of Suceava, Suceava, Romania; Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ştefan cel Mare University of Suceava, Suceava, Romania",IEEE Access,1 May 2023,2023,11.0,,40916.0,40929.0,"Web server access log files are text files containing important data about server activities, client requests addressed to a server, server responses, etc. Large-scale analysis of these data can contribute to various improvements in different areas of interest. The main problem lies in storing these files in their raw form, over long time, to allow analysis processes to be run at any time enabling information to be extracted as foundation for high quality decisions. Our research focuses on offering an economical, secure, and high-performance solution for the storage of large amount of raw log files. Proposed system implements a Data Lake (DL) architecture in cloud using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) for extract–load–transform (ELT) pipelines. This architecture allows large volumes of data to be stored in their raw form. Afterwards they can be subjected to transformation and advanced analysis processes without the need of a structured writing scheme. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a solution that is affordable and more accessible to perform web server access log data ingestion, storage and transformation over the newest technology, Data Lake. As derivative contribution, we proposed the use of Azure Blob Trigger Function to implement the algorithm of transforming log files into parquet files leading to 90% reduction in storage space compared to their original size. That means much lower storage costs than if they had been stored as log files. A hierarchical data storage model has also been proposed for shared access to data over different layers in the DL architecture, on top of which Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) rules have been proposed for storage cost efficiency. We proposed ingesting log files into a Data Lake deployed in cloud due to ease of deployment and low storage costs. The aim is to maintain this data in the long term, to be used in future advanced analytics processes by cross-referencing with other organizational or external data. That could bring important benefits.

These data points typically originate from various sources, primarily governmental bodies encompassing statistics, budgets, legislation, public services, and geospatial data (maps, satellite imagery), along with domain users comprising individuals, organizations, and governments [2]. The SDGs are intricately crafted, taking into account a multitude of factors and pinpointing key indicators that influence these factors.

It stores both transaction log and data files in one directory, and provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing on top of existing data lakes, such as S3, ADLS, GCS, and HDFS. Different from data warehouses, delta lakes allow data to be stored in the original format, retain complete data information, and provide efficient and low-cost storage solutions for data computing and analysis businesses. However, Since Delta Lake metadata is scattered in different resource files, the lack of a unified metadata view increases the difficulty of data governance. Also, Delta Lake adopts an open source storage system as the underlying storage, and its basic access control does not isolate different users, which may lead the risk of data leakage. At present, most common storage systems use data tables’ row and column fields for access control, while delta lake treats the file group as an object. In this paper, aiming at the difficulty of data governance, we design a data lake metadata management method to achieve unified and efficient management of metadata information in heterogeneous data.

In safety-critical sectors, maintaining situational awareness is essential for performance and error prevention. Situational awareness (SAW) is crucial for the success of activities in many different domains, such as surveillance, humanitarian aid, and search and rescue efforts. SAW is however susceptible to enemy attacks. By giving users enhanced coverage, it increases survivability and mission capability. Recently, Smart gadgets used data to address crisis scenarios and provide real-time tracking to protect law enforcement personnel out in the field. Despite these developments, it might be challenging for first responders to get a precise feel of their surroundings due to an abundance of field data. Security teams need to be able to quickly transform this data into actionable intelligence using a few instruments at their disposal, including body cameras, fingerprint scanners, and facial recognition software. Officers can cut through the noise to acquire actual real-time situational awareness by integrating heterogeneous information into a cohesive platform. Therefore, the proposed work examines potential mitigation measures while considering hostile threats and assaults against SAW systems. Additionally, information and alarms can be instantly sent between operators and field officers using vital interface features. The optimization of the AutoML system is proposed for fusion of sensor data.

Command by intent is a paradigm that empowers subordinate units to exercise measured initiative to meet mission goals and accept prudent risk within commander's intent. It improves agility of military operations by allowing exploitation of local opportunities without an explicit directive from the commander to do so. This paper discusses what the paradigm entails in terms of architectural decisions for data fusion systems tasked with real-time information collection to satisfy operational mission goals. In our system, information needs of decisions are expressed at a high level, and shared among relevant nodes. The selected nodes, then, jointly operate to meet mission information needs by forwarding and caching relevant data without explicit directives regarding the objects to fetch and sources to contact. A preliminary evaluation of the system is presented using a target tracking application, set in the context of a NATO-based mission scenario, called Anglova. Evaluation results show that delegating some decision authority to the data fusion system (in terms of objects to fetch and sources to contact) allows it to save more network resources, while also increasing mission success rate. The system is therefore particularly well-suited to operation in partially denied or contested environments, where resource bottlenecks caused by adversarial activity impair one's ability to collect real-time information for mission-critical decision making.",,978-0-9964527-6-2,10.23919/ICIF.2018.8455376,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8455376,IoBT;Command-by-intent;Decision-centric,Decision trees;Data integration;Sensor systems;Prefetching;Bandwidth;Sensor fusion,,2.0,,14.0,,6 Sep 2018,10-13 July 2018,10-13 July 2018,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The effectiveness of managing distributed resources depends on the ability to make complex decisions. The complexity is due in part to the circuitous nature of fusing data from multiple sensor sources to provide a representation of the operational environment from which to redirect sensors for further information optimization and from which to base military operations. The ""goodness"" of such complex decisions depends on the ""goodness"" of the information available and the understanding of the situation from a ""big picture"" perspective.

Review of reception towards deployed forces must be analyzed, especially in areas vital for U.S. national interests. Predicting population behavior is critical for success and must include a qualitative as well as a quantitative solution. Additionally, a feedback mechanism is needed for periodically updating reception towards presence of U.S. Forces over time. We propose a method for predicting sentiment towards deployed U.S. Forces in near real time, to efficiently propitiate manpower resources, allocate equipment assets, and reduce cost of analyses.

Srinivasan,"SAP Architect SAP America, Newtown Square, PA; Enterprise Solution Architect Simplifi Commerce Inc., Newtown Square, PA; Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education, Mentor - Cybersecurity Research School of Computing, Tamilnadu, India",2025 International Conference on Digital Innovations for Sustainable Solutions (ICDISS),12 Jan 2026,2025,,,1,6,"Enterprise has started to leverage Augmented Reality (AR) to increase productivity, allow real-time cooperation and augmented decision making. AR-enabled productive spaces can connect virtual overlays with the user's real-world, overlaying relevant data directly into his/her field of view. But this smooth transition also presents major cybersecurity issues. Real-time AR data overlays that, in many scenarios, are wirelessly transmitted, are vulnerable to interception, manipulation and injection of adverse content by adversaries. These kinds of cyberattacks can result in data leaks, disruption to operations, or even health risks for personnel in mission-critical situations like factory floors, medical procedures or out in the field. A multitiered cybersecurity framework for safeguarding AR- enabled spaces from interception and tampering of real-time data overlays is proposed in this research. The cure uses encrypted data streaming, zero-trust network architecture, AI-based anomaly detection and handshake authentication. Encrypted communication paths, seeded with dynamic key exchange, guarantee against undue eavesdropping of transmitted overlays. Zero-trust guidelines allow for the dynamic authentication of both devices and users to protect against unauthorized access of AR streams AI-driven threat detection observes the flow of data in real-time to identify any abnormal behavior patterns, such as surprising overlay changes or suspicious traffic. Integrity verification mechanisms, deployed at the edge, cross-verify the data authenticity prior to rendering it on the user code naveen s3 s device, preventing the delivery of tampered content. The proposed framework was tested with a simulated AR environment which fuses collaborative CAD modelling, live IoT sensor feed and remote expert facility. Several hypothetical cyberattack models including the man-in-the- middle (MITM) interception, overlay injection and replay attacks were reproduced. The experimental results show that the proposed CGI can detect overlay manipulation attacks with a detection rate of 94.5% and prevent interception 98% of times with no visible delay in rendering ($<30 ~\text{ms}$). This research reveals the pressing requirement for strong cyber- defense within AR work environments, which are quickly expanding from niche applications to enterprise standards. This approach can protect real-time AR content against disclosure, alteration, and denial of service-related threats on both network level and application level. Results lay a foundation for the development of secure, scalable strategies for performing AR deployments that maintain the rich, high-speed experience that is necessary for effective workspace operations and protect against emerging cyber threats.",,979-8-3315-5641-9,10.1109/ICDISS68238.2025.11320666,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11320666,Real-Time Data Overlay Protection;Augmented Reality Security;Zero-Trust Architecture;Data Integrity Verification;AR Workspace Cybersecurity,Solid modeling;Mission critical systems;Authentication;Rendering (computer graphics);Real-time systems;Cryptography;Computer crime;Artificial intelligence;Augmented reality;Eavesdropping,,,,16.0,IEEE,12 Jan 2026,14-15 Nov. 2025,14-15 Nov. 2025,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Senapati,"Lowe’s, Mooresville, NC, USA; Department of Computer Science, UALR, Little Rock, AR, USA",IEEE Access,23 Jan 2026,2026,14.0,,10436,10456,"Fraudulent activities targeting retail Point-of-Sale (POS) systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated and surpassing the capabilities of predominant rule-based or single-modal machine learning model-based defense mechanisms, as they struggle to capture the complex and evolving fraudulent activity patterns. As a result, the digital economy is experiencing a growing concern originating from increasing financial losses based on fraudulent activities at retail POS systems. This paper presents FraudFusion, a novel multi-modal ensemble learning explainable framework designed to enhance fraud detection in retail POS environments. It fuses transactional, device telemetry, and behavioral context into a unified vector that ensures defense against a wide range of fraudulent attempts. A novel Context-Aware Dynamic Modality Weighting (CADMW) mechanism has been introduced in this framework that dynamically adjusts learner contributions per transaction based on real-time modality relevance. Besides, a unique combination of context-aware pruning and quantization further optimizes the system response and resource utilization for edge devices, making it an appropriate solution for resource-constrained environments. The application of the FraudFusion framework on real-world retail transactions demonstrates an impressive fraudulent activity detection accuracy of 94.9%. The precision, recall, and F1-score values are 94.2%, 94.8%, and 94.5%, respectively. With 41.9% CPU resources and 148 MB RAM, it responds in real-time with only 72.6 ms latency. Moreover, it demonstrates resilience to a wide range of adversarial attacks through Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples. Most importantly, it is an explainable system, which is essential for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the financial sector. In a nutshell, the FraudFusion framework is an interpretable, scalable, and optimized solution equipped with advanced capabilities to detect next-generation fraudulent activities at retail POS systems.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2026.3655398,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11357914,Fraud detection;multi-modal learning;point-of-sale systems;anomaly detection;ensemble learning;context-aware systems;edge computing;explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);adversarial robustness;out-of-distribution detection;retail cybersecurity;real-time analytics,Fraud;Real-time systems;Image edge detection;Anomaly detection;Telemetry;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence;Robustness;Ensemble learning;Finance,,,,58.0,CCBY,19 Jan 2026,2026,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

However, in most of the current evidence-theory-based CSS schemes, only real-time evidence information is utilized to estimate the sensing reliability of cognitive users, like the difference in SNR or similarity degree. Inadequate consideration causes CSS system being vulnerable to SSDF attacks, and the correctness of global decision making cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a credible CSS scheme based on evidence theory. It evaluates the credibility of each SU with two indexes, which are the statistical reputation factor and the real-time reliability factor, respectively. In addition, considering the transmitted data rises with the number of SUs increasing, we propose a rational mass distribution (RMD) approach to adjust evidence theory to binary hypothesis test in spectrum sensing context. As a consequence, both the data volume to be transmitted and the workload at data fusion center has been reduced. Simulation results have proved that the proposed scheme is effective and robust to defense against distinctive SSDF attack patterns.",,978-1-5386-1211-8,10.1109/PIERS-FALL.2017.8293109,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293109,,Sensors;Cascading style sheets;Reliability;Real-time systems;Electromagnetics;Collaboration;Cognitive radio,,,,12.0,IEEE,19 Feb 2018,19-22 Nov. 2017,19-22 Nov. 2017,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
"Transitioning from Legacy Air Traffic Management to Airspace Management through Secure, Cloud-Native Automation Solutions",A. Solomon; Z. Crawford,"Digital Aviation Solutions Thales, Arlington, VA, USA; Digital Aviation Solutions Thales, Arlington, VA, USA",2021 IEEE/AIAA 40th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),15 Nov 2021,2021,,,1,8,"Advancements in Cloud-native services, Machine-Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Rapid Application Development (RAD) using the Agile methodology has led countless industries to achieving desirable levels of automation while reducing cost and improving quality software deployments, timely / iterative delivery, and accountability. Coupling this framework with the principle of security as a shared responsibility further enhances the efficacy of an integrated Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) Team within organizations to deliver secured digital solutions. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved through multi-year, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts—in terms of new capabilities—in constant investment decision planning cycles, costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this automation evolution vision for ANSPs.This paper examines the migration from today’s systems to secure, cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations, like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that must be considered for this evolution.",2155-7209,978-1-6654-3420-1,10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594313,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9594313,Automation;ATM;Cloud-native;Microservices,Automation;Costs;Online banking;Clouds;Safety;Stakeholders;Security,,3.0,,7.0,IEEE,15 Nov 2021,3-7 Oct. 2021,3-7 Oct. 2021,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In the urban terrain, for example, warfighter survivability, lethality and operational effectiveness are directly related to the quality of situational awareness (SA), which is based on essential elements of information (EEIs) that currently flow down through radio communications with the commander and analysts. EEIs represent information regarding the enemy and environment critical to a given operational mission and are based on intelligence gathered from either battlefield sensing assets or other HUMINT. As battle and mission objectives change, initial information provided to the warfighter in the form of pre-operational intelligence become quickly obsolete.

Liu,The University of Texas at Dallas; The University of Texas at Dallas; The University of Texas at Dallas,2018 IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS),9 Aug 2018,2018,,,190,201,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are being widely applied in many advanced embedded systems that require autonomous decision making, e.g., autonomous driving and robotics. To handle resource-demanding DNN workloads, graphic processing units (GPUs) have been used as the main acceleration engine. Although much research has been conducted to algorithmically optimize the efficiency of applying DNN to applications such as object recognition, limited attention has been given to optimizing the execution of GPU-accelerated DNN workloads at the system level. In this paper, we propose S^3DNN, a system solution that optimizes the execution of DNN workloads on GPU in a real-time multi-tasking environment, which simultaneously optimizes the two (sometimes) conflicting goals of real-time correctness and throughput. S^3DNN contains a governor that selectively gathers system-wide DNN requests to perform smart data fusion, and a novel supervised streaming and scheduling framework that combines a deadline-aware scheduler with the concurrency-enabled CUDA stream technique. To simultaneously maximize concurrency-induced benefits and real-time performance, S^3DNN explores a rather interesting and unique characteristic of DNN workloads, where multiple layers of a DNN instance often exhibit a gradually decreased GPU resource utilization pattern. We have fully implemented S^3DNN in a GPU-accelerated system and have conducted extensive sets of experiments evaluating the efficacy of S^3DNN under a wide range of system and workload scenarios. The results show that S^3DNN significantly improves upon state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated DNN processing frameworks, e.g., up to 37% and over 40% improvements in real-time performance and throughput, respectively.",,978-1-5386-5295-4,10.1109/RTAS.2018.00028,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8430082,GPU;GPGPU;DNN;Real time,Graphics processing units;Real-time systems;Kernel;Videos;Throughput;Object detection;Yarn,,62.0,,42.0,IEEE,9 Aug 2018,11-13 April 2018,11-13 April 2018,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

To date, no review paper has quantitatively compared the real-time performance between different localisation techniques based on various hardware platforms and programming languages and analysed the relations among localisation methodologies, real-time performance and accuracy. Therefore, this paper discusses the state-of-the-art localisation techniques and analyses their overall performance in AV application. For further analysis, this paper firstly proposes a localisation algorithm operations capability (LAOC)-based equivalent comparison method to compare the relative computational complexity of different localisation techniques; then, it comprehensively discusses the relations among methodologies, computational complexity, and accuracy. Analysis results show that the computational complexity of localisation approaches differs by a maximum of about 107 times, whilst accuracy varies by about 100 times. Vision- and data fusion-based localisation techniques have about 2–5 times potential for improving accuracy compared with lidar-based localisation. Lidar- and vision-based localisation can reduce computational complexity by improving image registration method efficiency. Data fusion-based localisation can achieve better real-time performance compared with lidar- and vision-based localisation because each standalone sensor does not need to develop a complex algorithm to achieve its best localisation potential.

Such constraints cause poor decision making, poor stock control and insufficiency in regard to responsiveness to changing production requirements. To meet the issues described above, though, the application of Adaptive Zone-Aware IoT Mesh equipped with Autonomous Inventory Decision Agents (AZA-IMAD) can be proposed on this paper; it is a full edge-centric inventory control framework. AZA-IMAD implements the IoT sensor nodes in a truly dynamic form of zoning that are governed with autonomous decision agents that have the capability to perform real time sensor fusion, anomaly detection as well as reconstruction of replenishment at the edge itself. A zone-aware communication protocol will further ensure the vital changes will be transmitted to the network to reduce network congestion but a lightweight blockchain ledger will provide auditing to diverse changes that are decentralized as well as tamper-resistant and will not need web connectivity on an ongoing basis. The overall evaluation in a virtual smart manufacturing arrangement reveals AZA-IMAD achieves an desired inventory monitoring of an 91.75 that is above the conventional process of 65% - 85%. Also, specifically, the framework recognizes stock change at a rate of 93,90 and induces timely replenishment decision at 91 of the stock at 93% accuracy. In addition, AZA-IMAD saves on 38 percent of bandwidth in addition to activation response of decisions in milliseconds since the centralized processing bypasses are eliminated.

This paper surveys the work performed on data fusion and system adaptation using autonomic nervous system responses in psychophysiology and physiological computing during the last ten years. First, five prerequisites for data fusion are examined: psychological model selection, training set preparation, feature extraction, normalization and dimension reduction. Then, different methods for either classification or estimation of psychological states from the extracted features are presented and compared. Finally, implementations of system adaptation are reviewed: changing the system that the user is interacting with in response to cognitive or affective information inferred from autonomic nervous system responses. The paper is aimed primarily at psychologists and computer scientists who have already recorded autonomic nervous system responses and now need to create algorithms to determine the subject’s psychological state.",1873-7951,,10.1016/j.intcom.2012.04.003,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8147227,Affective computing;Physiological computing;Psychophysiology;Data fusion;Autonomic nervous system,,,44.0,3.0,,,18 Jan 2018,May 2012,,OUP,OUP Journals

To realize this aim we forward a Bayesian non-parametric Dirichlet Process (DP) decision-making approach for real-time monitoring of UPM process using the data gathered from multiple, heterogeneous sensors. The sensor signals are acquired under different experimental conditions from a UPM setup instrumented with a heterogeneous sensing array consisting of miniature tri-axis force, tri-axis vibration, and acoustic emission (AE) sensors mounted in close proximity to the cutting tool. We track the prominent nonlinear and non-Gaussian signal patterns evident in the experimentally acquired sensor data using an adaptive non-parametric DP modeling technique. A cohesive decision concerning the UPM process condition is made by developing a new supervised learning method, which integrates the DP-model state estimates with an evidence theoretic sensor data fusion method. Using this combined DP-evidence theoretic approach, UPM process drifts and anomalies, such as sudden changes in the depth of cut, feed rate, and spindle speed that deleteriously affect surface finish, and hence cause high yield losses, are detected and classified with over 90% accuracy (with ${<} 5\hbox{\%}$  standard deviation). We compared these results with popular classification techniques, e.g., naïve Bayes, self-organizing map, and support vector machine; these conventional techniques had classification accuracy in the range of 83%–88%. Consequently, this research makes the following practically relevant contributions: 1) real-time identification of the incipient UPM process anomalies from multiple sensors and 2) prescribing the optimal subset of sensors signals contingent to particular process anomalies.",1558-3783,,10.1109/TASE.2015.2447454,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165687,Dirichlet process modeling;evidence theory;process monitoring;sensor fusion;ultraprecision machining,Monitoring;Surface treatment;Machining;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Real-time systems;Data integration,,40.0,,39.0,IEEE,23 Jul 2015,April 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Such conventional measuring methods reverse personal difference of reaction of the immune system and there is no real-time decision making system that is limiting to clinical application. In order to bridge these constraints, this proposes the Real-Time Vaccine Response Prediction System (RT-VRPS), the state-of art platform purposely aimed to predict personal vaccine response by integrating the most recent concepts: genomic and proteomic. RT-VRPS, which is constructed using next-generation sequencing technology and mass spectrometry based on high throughput, can deliver high context multi-omic immune signatures in a few hours upon receipt of sample. The data are developed with an elucidable machine learning model, and clinicians are able to examine the predictive data and base on data and make evidence-based, individualized choices. The adaptive learning engine in the platform keeps on updating itself, keeping new knowledge and enhancing the precision and reliability of its prognostic capability, making them more precise with time. It is deeply complimented with a clinician dashboard where one is able to readily gain insight in real time which can be utilized to mould and build a response-oriented and adaptive treatment planning. In large-scale empirical evaluations, RT-VRPS has proven far more effective than traditional, unimodal, and retrospective models with respect to predictive abilities, processing rapidity and dependability to confounding factors. Its high detailed and time sensitive perspective of immune reactions can allow clinicians to craft precision programs of vaccination individually and make all its precision programs much safer and effective in the treatment of the patients. Furthermore, its economic and immediate scalability during operations makes the dynamic clinical processes possible, which can be explained by the need to direct the clinical workforce responsiveness to the immunological requirements that are constantly colkning. According to a sense, RT-VRPS should be considered as an innovative initiative in the framework of creating tailored personal immunology, complete gaps in the links of the already applied approaches to immunization, and the enhancement of the overall efficiency of the general health community approach.",,979-8-3315-7073-6,10.1109/IETACS68750.2025.11385620,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11385620,Vaccine Response Prediction;Genomics;Proteomics;AI;Precision Medicine;Multi-omics Integration;Real-Time Analytics,Adaptation models;Decision making;Transcriptomics;Proteomics;Predictive models;Real-time systems;Data models;Vaccines;Bioinformatics;Engines,,,,13.0,IEEE,20 Feb 2026,6-8 Nov. 2025,6-8 Nov. 2025,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Transparency, trust, data security, and scalability are traditionally regarded as the major deficiencies of DSS models which may impede their efficacy in critical decision-making environments. Seamlessly integrating blockchain with AI-powered DSS can help with data integrity, as well as prevent manipulation and inconsistencies while improving trust with many different stakeholders, because all transactions on a blockchain are transparent immutable, owing to blockchain's decentralized ledger system. The paper investigates a hybrid Blockchain-AI framework that can overcome the main drawbacks of existing DSS systems. This means that AI predictive analytics and machine learning models can match massive datasets for decision making, while blockchain guarantees the integrity, traceability, and decentralization of the data's inputs and outputs. Smart contracts: automate decision processes & ensure tamper-proof execution for defined set of rules & policies In addition, blockchain consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-Stake, Byzantine Fault Tolerance) can facilitate transparency and verifiability, thus improving conflict-avoiding distributed decision-making. To enable privacy-preserving collaboration between organizations, we introduce a new Decentralized AI Decision Support System (Dai-DSS) framework that integrates federated learning and a distributed ledger. It enables real-time data sharing while preserving data sovereignty, which helps organizations comply with regulatory standards such as GDRP and HIPAA. We are also looking at various optimization techniques such as off-chain scaling solutions (sidechains, Layer-2 protocols, etc.) that improve system efficiency while still keeping the system decentralized. Our research shows that by comparing with the traditional DSS models, the Blockchain-AI integration strengthens system resilience, improves the elimination of single point failure and facilitates open, trustless decision-making processes. Practical applications and the benefits of the proposed model are demonstrated through case studies in healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. Lastly, we address the challenges including computational overhead, interoperability and regulatory challenges, and suggest future research avenues on AI-augmented consensus algorithms and quantum-resistant cryptography.

The irrigation system is one of the most important components of a system of agriculture. The crop's productivity will be directly influenced by the efficiency and applicability of the irrigation system. Water scarcity is one of the greatest challenges for an irrigation system. The efficient use of land, water, and energy resources depends on Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart agriculture systems. In this article, a distributed data reduction and decision-making (DiDaReD) approach for IoT-based smart farming irrigation systems is proposed. The DiDaReD approach is implemented on two levels: sensor devices and edge gateway. At the sensor device level, we implemented a lightweight scoring method for removing the redundant collected soil moisture readings before sending them to the edge gateway. At the edge of the gateway, a voting technique is applied to the scores of received readings from sensor devices to produce a decision regarding irrigation of the monitored farming field according to the soil moisture state of this field. Finally, since the DiDaReD approach is periodic and works in real-time, we implement a decision reduction algorithm to prevent sending the same decision notifications to the actuator, thus saving the energy of the IoT network. Several experiments are implemented using real sensed data from the farming field, and the conducted results show that the proposed DiDaReD outperforms other methods in terms of data reduction ratio, number of sent readings, energy consumption, network lifetime, data integrity, decisions, and total energy consumed by the edge-gateway node.",2473-7674,979-8-3503-3509-5,10.1109/ICCCNT56998.2023.10307568,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10307568,smart irrigation;data reduction;decision making;IoT;smart agriculture,Smart agriculture;Irrigation;Soil moisture;Decision making;Sociology;Distributed databases;Logic gates,,,,23.0,IEEE,23 Nov 2023,6-8 July 2023,6-8 July 2023,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

One of the key ingredients in the development is the implementation of multi-sensorial networks capable of aggregating different data streams, from passing cars and noise levels, to pollution indicators and human mobility trends. Yet the complexity, scale, and diversity of these data pose significant challenges to conventional analytic techniques. In this research, we propose a cutting-edge deep learning architecture: Spatiotemporal Convolutional Networks (ST-CNs) for urban activity recognition, analysis and prediction using both spatial and temporal data characteristic. In this work, the ST-CN proposed framework employs a hybrid architecture of 2D CNNs for spatial feature extraction and 3D or temporal convolutional layers to capture time-dependent patterns. This two-aspect ability helps this model to identify moving events including pedestrian flows, emergency incidents, and traffic congestion occurring them space-time dimension. Networked with a wide range of sensor inputs from CCTV video feeds, IoT devices and mobile geolocation data, the network learns patterns from real-world multisensory urban environments in real-time. The model employs attention mechanisms and dimensionality reduction layers to alleviate computational complexity in managing sensor data at large scales while still maintaining high-resolution spatial features. Central to this work is unsupervised and semi-supervised domain transfer of the model, trained on various urban datasets including images, and different smart city infrastructure. Data fusion approaches are mainly employed to unify different sensor measurements (e.g., noise, delay and data sparseness) into a coherent decision making logic. Our experimental studies on real-world smart city datasets attest to the accuracy of our event detection, anomaly detection, and urban condition forecasting abilities (e.g., predicting traffic congestion and public risks). Performance is measured in terms of system accuracy as well as the speed, and when compared to the conventional CNN or RNN models our ST-CN model has demonstrated a superior performance. Our system is able to scale and generalize to other city environments with little need for re-training, ensuring an optimal allocation of resources and enabling real-time agile urban management.

Maps help prioritize where assets are deployed in disasters in efficient ways and are important for compiling data layers about normal environmental risk inequalities of various indicators in general, to locate geographically the most vulnerable populations in order to improve their lives. Central to both kinds of mapping efforts are accessibility and clarity of information, whether in plotting a rapidly evolving natural or human-made hazard in a disaster zone, or for sharing with first responders, or for ongoing daily awareness and thus better administration about regular environmental risk in national populations. The RiskRadar platform prototype improves five shortcomings found regularly in other platforms for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and has more comprehensive data integration and visualization tools with its unique data indexes to enhance disaster preparedness and response. By integrating diverse environmental and urban data sets, RiskRadar shows different kinds of risk easily. From this, it facilitates informed decision-making on priorities and timely actions, while aiding more coordinated awareness and thus coordinated response to risk. This paper examines functionalities of a prototype platform for how it bolsters disaster resilience particularly in contexts desired by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). With a user-friendly interface, RiskRadar lets stakeholders, first responders, and the public at large access the same critical information.

Precise and robust HMIP with low computational resources remains a challenge due to the stochastic nature of hand motion and the diversity of HRC tasks. This paper proposes a framework that combines hand trajectories and gaze data to foster robust, real-time HMIP with minimal to no training. A novel 3D vector field method is introduced for hand trajectory representation, leveraging minimum jerk trajectory predictions to discern potential hand motion endpoints. This is statistically combined with gaze fixation data using a weighted Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Acknowledging the potential variances in saccadic eye motion due to factors like fatigue or inattentiveness, we incorporate stationary gaze entropy to gauge visual concentration, thereby adjusting the contribution of gaze fixation to the HMIP.

However, achieving seamless integration across these technologies remains a major challenge due to persistent issues of data interoperability, consistency, collaboration, and intelligent data exchange throughout the product lifecycle. Moreover, the limited intelligence at the machine level and the fragmentation of data across heterogeneous systems hinder the realization of fully connected, autonomous manufacturing environments. To address these challenges, this work conducts a comprehensive review of the literature on DTh and DTw technologies, focusing on their application in additive manufacturing (AM) and their alignment with international standards for data exchange and system interoperability. Building on this foundation, a unified digital ecosystem for contextualized intelligence is proposed, aiming to integrate DTh and DTw through standardized, semantically rich, and interoperable data flows. Furthermore, a standards-based DTh–DTw framework is presented, leveraging key industrial standards, including STEP/STEP-NC, MTConnect, QIF, OPC UA, MQTT, and ISO 23247, to ensure traceability, real-time synchronization, and data-driven decision-making across the AM lifecycle. Two implementation scenarios validate the proposed approach: (i) an FDM-based AM process using STEP-NC and MTConnect for integrated process planning and monitoring, and (ii) a robotic wire-based LMD cell featuring three DTw implementations compliant with ISO 23247 for real-time simulation, predictive maintenance, and process visualization. These implementations demonstrate the feasibility of constructing interoperable, data-centric manufacturing workflows using open standards. The results underscore the potential of the proposed ecosystem to enhance interoperability, data consistency, and intelligence across manufacturing processes, while also revealing current limitations in AM-specific standardization and cross-platform integration.

Current disaster management systems often rely on unimodal data streams and centralized processing, which limit prediction accuracy and response speed. This paper proposes an AI-powered multimodal disaster prediction and response system that integrates remote sensing imagery, ground-based IoT sensor data, and social media feeds for real-time situational awareness. The system leverages a hybrid deep learning framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for satellite image interpretation, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal event forecasting, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for extracting early warning signals from textual data. Edge analytics is employed to enable low-latency, localized decision-making, reducing dependency on cloud-only infrastructures.

Robots should be able to carry out any assigned task autonomously, yet cooperate with other robots when allowed to by the environmental conditions. To enable this, there is a growing interest in robotic software solutions which are modular, scalable and easy to test. In this paper, we introduce iCADME, a novel autonomy architecture, which achieves such features thanks to a software eco-system which relies on a hierarchy of tasks, in charge of perception and decision-making, and of behaviour strategies, which act as the interface towards the robot lower level control architecture. The modularity and the attention to the system configuration are instrumental for the user to reuse the software and to expand the task portfolio. Thanks to the strong decoupling between perception/decision-making and action, achieved also with the design of an interface layer with the external middleware, iCADME can be easily integrated with various planning and control systems and with different middleware software. On top of that, a behaviour trees (BTs) mission management system is introduced. BTs enable the building of complex missions by assembling a portfolio of tasks, with features of high modularity and reactivity.

However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) restricted perception range of traditional onboard sensors (e.g., radar, cameras), leading to insufficient decision robustness in complex scenarios; (2) poor training stability in Deep Q-Networks (DQN) due to Q-value overestimation; and (3) privacy leakage and high communication overhead in centralized training.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a collaborative collision avoidance decision-making method integrating multi-source fusion and federated learning. The approach builds a 20-dimensional state space by integrating vehicle states and remote sensing data. Vehicle states include speed (normalized to [0, 30m/s] , orientation [0, 2π], acceleration [-5,3m/s2] , and steering angle [-0.6, 0.6rad]. Remote sensing data cover road curvature and hazard markers. This fusion significantly enhances the comprehensiveness of environmental perception. A Double DQN strategy (target network update interval: 100 steps) combined with batch normalization and a compound reward function (collision penalty: -100, speed rationality reward: 0.2, safe distance penalty: -0.5, risk avoidance reward: 0.5) effectively mitigates Q-value overestimation.

This digital twin integrated Earth Observation (EO) data with in-situ measurements from autonomous, crewed, and fixed ocean platforms. A modular data analysis toolbox was developed to cross-calibrate EO and in-situ data, ensuring quality-controlled assimilation into a virtual twin model at daily intervals. Forecasts and nowcasts generated by the virtual twin model were analysed by AI-driven applications to optimise future data collection by generating and transmitting mission plans to autonomous underwater vehicles in real-time. This closed-loop digital twin system provided optimised high spatial and temporal resolution data suitable for detecting phytoplankton blooms and related deoxygenation events as they emerge. Key lessons from the deployment highlight the need for rigorous engineering in data integration and management, ensuring resilience against erroneous data. Trade-offs between data timeliness and quality necessitated redesigning workflows to meet strict operational timeframes while maintaining data integrity. Additionally, despite automation, human-on-the-loop monitoring remained essential for overseeing data pipelines and machine learning decision-making. These insights provide valuable guidance for future environmental digital twins, enhancing scientific understanding and supporting sustainable marine management.

In this study, a unified data engineering framework for smart mobility is provided, combining three key data streams: traffic congestion, public transportation operations (GTFS), and environmental pollutants (AQI). The architecture uses Apache Kafka and Flink for high-throughput streaming processing, performs semantic transformations using JSON-LD and GeoSPARQL, and stores spatiotemporal data with PostGIS and InfluxDB. A fusion engine aligns data streams to a common time and geo-spatial grid and screens out anomalies based on Z-score thresholds.

Many such devices sense the deployed environment and generate a variety of data and send them to the server for analysis as data streams. A Data Stream Manager (DSM) at the server collects the data streams (often called big data) to perform real time analysis and decision-making for these critical applications. A malicious adversary may access or tamper with the data in transit. One of the challenging tasks in such applications is to assure the trustworthiness of the collected data so that any decisions are made on the processing of correct data. Assuring high data trustworthiness requires that the system satisfies two key security properties: confidentiality and integrity. To ensure the confidentiality of collected data, we need to prevent sensitive information from reaching the wrong people by ensuring that the right people are getting it. Sensed data are always associated with different sensitivity levels based on the sensitivity of emerging applications or the sensed data types or the sensing devices. For example, a temperature in a precision agriculture application may not be as sensitive as monitored data in smart health. Providing multilevel data confidentiality along with data integrity for big sensing data streams in the context of near real time analytics is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Selective Encryption (SEEN) method to secure big sensing data streams that satisfies the desired multiple levels of confidentiality and data integrity. Our method is based on two key concepts: common shared keys that are initialized and updated by DSM without requiring retransmission, and a seamless key refreshment process without interrupting the data stream encryption/decryption. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of our SEEN method show that it can significantly improve the efficiency and buffer usage at DSM without compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data streams.",2332-7790,,10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2702172,AISRF-08140; ARC(grant numbers:LP140100816); NSF(grant numbers:1652107); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7921576,Big data stream;selective encryption;data confidentiality;data integrity;data security,Big data;Real-time systems;Sensors;Encryption,,38.0,,50.0,IEEE,8 May 2017,1 Sept. 2019,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The traditional practice of signing documents on verified stamp papers could no longer serve as an adequate countermeasure against modern-day digital malpractices. The most common digital methods currently circulating provide either secure document delivery through cryptographic signatures or document analysis via AI, while very few cover both.

This guarantees secure verification of documents through a mechanism that generates cryptographic hashes and compares them to the entries on a privately deployed Ethereum blockchain for tamper-evident yet nonrevealing authentication. Concurrently, the summarization module uses machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to allow users to extract key clauses and important terms from documents, thus saving a great deal of user effort in interpreting lengthy legal content. In contrast to existing systems focusing separately on security or content processing, this integrated platform unlike existing systems that focus either only on security or only on content processing, addresses both integrity and accessibility. The novelty, therefore, is having a single interface where users can check for a document’s legitimacy or summarize content as they see fit.

To address these challenges, in this study, we developed a robust multi-object detection and tracking method for moving objects based on radar and camera data fusion. First, the radar and camera perform target detection independently, and the detection results are correlated in the image plane to generate a random finite set with an object type. Then, based on the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density algorithm framework, the tracking process is improved using elliptic discriminant thresholds, an attenuation function, and simplified pruning methods.

However, these models are inherently statistical predictors rather than real-time reasoning systems, leading to fundamental limitations in accessing up-to-date information and verifying factual accuracy. This issue is particularly critical in high-stakes domains such as cryptocurrency markets, decentralized finance (DeFi), and autonomous AI agents, where real-time, verifiable, and tamper-proof information is essential for decision-making.In this paper, we introduce AI Oracle, a novel framework that integrates blockchain-powered oracles with LLMs and autonomous agents to ensure real-time access to cryptographically verified knowledge. We compare AI Oracle with both standalone LLMs and retrieval-based systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), highlighting significant advantages in factual reliability, adversarial robustness, and interpretability. AI Oracle combines decentralized consensus, immutable storage, and cryptographic attestation to equip AI agents with enhanced resistance to manipulation, hallucination, and misinformation.Beyond architectural improvements, we explore the broader applicability of AI Oracle across domains that require provable correctness and trust—ranging from real-world asset (RWA) tokenization to autonomous agent coordination and decentralized governance.

Nowadays, despite the pilot can be equipped with an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) and he can rely on a Decision Support System (DSS), he still lacks in weather-related information. In fact, generally he has available only preflight-loaded forecasts and periodic updates data, usually in text format (such as METAR bulletin, NOTAM and PIREP messages, etc.) from the competent authorities. To increase the amount of information available to the pilot, perhaps by upgrading the avionic weather radar (AWR) to a polarimetric AWR and by introducing and integrating next generation avionic sensors (for humidity, pressure, wind shear, etc.) by itself does not directly help the pilot's decision-making process. In other words, the amount of heterogeneous data gathered in real time by the avionic systems need to be processed together with the stored information and to be provided to the pilot in a fast-interpreting format. In order to accomplish this task, a continuously updated risk map is necessary both to the pilot, through direct display, and to the DSS, which evaluates and suggests alternative routes. In this paper, we outline a method for determining the risk map related to weather phenomena encountered by the aircraft.

We present Kilo-UAV, the first multispectral micro-UAV detection dataset specifically designed for kilometer-range imaging, comprising 21 940 synchronously acquired multispectral remote sensing (RS) observations (visible-light, near-infrared (NIR), polarized imagery, and atmospheric attenuation-corrected data). The dataset focuses on UAV targets characterized by submeter dimensions and minimal pixel occupancy (average pixel area ratio <0.7%), systematically encompassing ten types, including urban built-up areas, coastal zones, and montane forests. To resolve the critical bottleneck of multisource RS data fusion, we propose the adaptive decision fusion network for remote sensing (ADF-RS). This architecture integrates an anomaly-modality sensitivity assessment module to dynamically optimize sensor-specific contribution weights, thereby enabling spatially coordinated representation of multispectral features. Experimental validation demonstrates that ADF-RS achieves state-of-the-art performance with an 86.57% detection accuracy ( $\text {mAP}_{{50}}$ ) on the test set, outperforming conventional visible-light-based approaches by a 23%-point margin, while maintaining real-time processing efficiency (57 frames/s on NVIDIA RTX3090 hardware). We further propose a lightweight computational framework optimized for edge computing devices, offering an embeddable solution for UAV airspace regulation within existing RS infrastructures.

The conventional centralized systems usually have difficulties in providing end-to-end visibility, effective resource distribution, and secure exchange of data among various stakeholders. To overcome these challenges, this paper will present a framework of the Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Optimization (BISCON), which uses Intelligent Edge Computing (IEC) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to achieve better efficiency and reliability of its operations. BISCON incorporates blockchain technology to facilitate immutable, transparent, and decentralized data management, and IEC facilitates low-latency processing and analytics of data at the network edge, eliminating the need to rely on centralized cloud servers. Moreover, the use of evolutionary algorithms maximizes the logistics parameters like inventory management, transportation planning, and forecasts the demand based on the data-driven adaptive decision-making process.

The accuracy of trust evaluations may be impacted by the failure of traditional trust measurements to take resilience under dynamic settings into consideration. In order to assess the flexibility and resilience of trust assessment models in cloud computing, this research presents a new metric called the Resilience-Aware Assessment. The Risk Assessment offers a thorough assessment of trust models in a variety of cloud environments by taking into account elements including system performance during high stress, reaction to malevolent activity, and recovery time following interruptions. In order to compare various trust evaluation models already in use, this study evaluates them using the RAA in addition to other traditional criteria like accuracy, scalability, and convergence time. The findings show that the RAA metric, especially in situations with uncertainty and volatility, successfully draws attention to trust model strengths and shortcomings that are missed by traditional metrics. The integration of the RAA metric into multi-criteria decision-making frameworks for cloud service selection is also covered in the article, offering a more adaptable and robust method for evaluating trust. Future research will examine how the RAA measure can be used to improve autonomous trust management systems in edge-cloud contexts as well as how it can be applied in real-time cloud orchestration.",,979-8-3315-2812-6,10.1109/ISENSE63713.2024.10872061,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10872061,Cloud computing;Trust model;Cloud service provider;Cloud security;Trust Evaluation methods;Trust score;RAA metric,Measurement;Cloud computing;Accuracy;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;System performance;Evaluation models;Trust management;Stress;Resilience,,2.0,,29.0,IEEE,17 Feb 2025,6-7 Dec. 2024,6-7 Dec. 2024,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In order to provide a solid foundation for the administration and optimization of smart city systems, this paper will suggest using blockchain and digital twin (DT) technologies. Virtual copies of physical objects called “digital twins” provide real‐time monitoring, analysis, and management of urban assets. Distributed and immutable ledger technology, blockchain ensures data integrity, security, and transparency. Data silos, security holes, and trust issues are some of the major challenges in smart city management that the proposed framework aims to address by integrating different technologies. This statement outlines a number of difficulties. Create digital twins of buildings, transportation networks, and utility networks as a first step in the integration process. These digital twins are constantly updating their data sets with information gathered from sensors, IoT devices, and other sources so they can provide a comprehensive view of the city's operational status. The next step is to employ blockchain technology to decentralize and secure the storage of digital twin data, making it impossible for unauthorized parties to access, alter, or damage the data. Smart contracts, which are executable codes stored on the blockchain, may automate and streamline processes inside the smart city ecosystem. Among the many advantages of this integrated approach are improved transparency in smart city operations, more security, and more accurate data. Blockchain's distributed ledger technology ensures that no one party has exclusive control over the data it stores, which fosters confidence and collaboration among all parties involved. The Blockchain Foundation is responsible for creating the blockchain. Smart contracts also allow for the automation of decision making and resource distribution based on rules and conditions that have already been defined. In this chapter, we will discuss the potential benefits, drawbacks, and practical concerns of implementing the suggested integration. Furthermore, it delves into potential use cases that might be realized via the integration of digital twin and blockchain technology. The optimization of energy use, traffic management, and emergency response systems are all instances of such use cases.

Machine learning models used in Predictive maintenance (PdM) are designed to analyze large volumes of data generated by industrial equipment. Reinforcement learning optimizes maintenance schedules by learning from interactions with the environment, balancing the trade-off between maintenance costs and equipment reliability.

Autonomy and networking are crucial aspects to consider in order to overcome the challenges typical of the marine environment, such as the limitations in underwater communications. This paper addresses both these aspects, describing the cooperative autonomy architecture and the strategies of the AUVs of the CMRE Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) network. We report tests from the LCAS18 trial. In this trial, cooperative strategies were supported by data sharing, facilitating track classification and the creation of a common tactical picture. The CMRE intelligent Cooperative Autonomous Decision Making Engine (iCADME) controlled the various phases of the robot mission. The produced tracks were classified in real-time and the ones likely to be generated by a target were selected to trigger a cooperative track prosecution strategy. The final objective was to facilitate track-to-track associations for the final target confirmation. To support cooperative autonomy, in LCAS18, the novel CMRE Cognitive Communication Architecture (CCA) was used in the CMRE ASW network for the first time. CCA managed the communications, with the aim of improving the use of the available bandwidth.The results from LCAS18 are one of the first examples in literature demonstrating the potentials of cooperative autonomy strategies and data fusion in realistic surveillance scenarios. Only autonomous decisions can in fact improve the mission performance when a reliable communication channel with the Command and Control centre cannot be guaranteed.

Enhancing Security and Privacy in Federated Learning for Connected Autonomous Vehicles With Lightweight Blockchain and Binius ZeroKnowledge Proofs,N. H. Andriambelo; N. Moradpoor,"Cognitive Sciences and Applications, University of Antananarivo, Madagascar; School of Computing, Engineering and the Built Environment, Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh, UK",2024 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN),13 Feb 2025,2024,,,1,8,"The rise of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) brings with it the need for secure and privacy-preserving machine learning models. Federated Learning (FL) allows AVs to collaboratively train models while keeping raw data localized. However, traditional FL systems are vulnerable to security threats, including adversarial attacks, data breaches, and dependency on a central aggregator, which can be a single point of failure. To address these concerns, this paper introduces a peer-to-peer decentralized federated learning system that integrates lightweight blockchain technology and Binius Zero- Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enhance security and privacy. In this system, Binius ZKPs ensure that model updates are cryptographically verified without exposing sensitive information, guaranteeing data confidentiality and integrity during the learning process. The lightweight blockchain framework secures the network by creating an immutable, decentralized record of all model updates, thus preventing tampering, fraud, or unauthorized modifications. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for a central aggregator, significantly enhancing system resilience to attacks and making it suitable for dynamic environments like AV networks. Additionally, the system's design includes Byzantine resilience, providing protection against adversarial nodes and ensuring that the global model aggregation process remains robust even in the presence of malicious actors. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves low-latency, scalability, and efficient resource usage while maintaining strong security and privacy guarantees, making it an ideal solution for real-time federated learning in autonomous vehicle networks.

With the capacity to offer a semantic query mechanism, we give a way for extracting and inferring information from wide production line data and improving production process management. The suggested system frequently employs inference‐based questions that are analogous to formal queries and are supported by sentences. Sensors on industrial production lines generate massive volumes of data that may be utilized to build digital twin models, which are simulations of actual assets. These models can give useful insights while also assisting in the analysis and optimization of industrial processes. However, without a semantic query method, extracting and inferring information from this data may be difficult. Knowledge graphs, a sort of graph‐based structure that records interactions between objects, are used as a basic way for formalizing knowledge into digital twin models in this work.

It emphasizes connectivity, automation and real-time data integration. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is one of the main driving forces behind this transformation. It is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging standard designed for efficient communications in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. The MQTT protocol provides seamless connectivity between diverse industrial devices, ensuring efficient data collection, transmission and integration with minimal network overhead. The MQTT gateways are among the key elements in the modern industrial automation applications and processes, but they also can bridge the legacy industrial systems and the advanced modern IIoT platforms. This is done by the translation of the traditional protocol data units into MQTT messages, which transforms the legacy systems into Industry 4.0-compliant solutions. The MQTT broker, acting as a central hub in the communication ecosystem, manages the message distribution among all connected devices, ensuring data availability for the analytical, monitoring and decision-making systems. At the present moment of time, this architecture is enabling scalable, interoperable and real-time data exchange, driving efficiency, predictive maintenance and smarter industrial operations in the era of Industry 4.0.

In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the infrastructure system and the current status of the smart infrastructure system based on the framework of closed feedback control loops: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that an effective smart infrastructure system should take into consideration the interaction between the smart infrastructure system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart response for city emergency, smart environmental protection, and smart humanity, and also study how the smart infrastructure system would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study will help us explore in-depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve the efficiency and safety of city infrastructure through vulnerability-oriented sensing and active monitoring; defining shared responsibilities; communication reinforcements; data visualization; static and dynamic data integration; hierarchical decision making; and optimized and coordinated demand response management.",,978-1-7281-9523-0,10.1109/UV50937.2020.9426194,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426194,automation;smart agents;ubiquitous real-time guidance and notification;modular construction and maintenance,Systematics;Smart cities;Decision making;Urban planning;Transportation;Smart homes;Maintenance engineering,,5.0,,146.0,IEEE,11 May 2021,24-27 Oct. 2020,24-27 Oct. 2020,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In Northern Europe heating energy alone accounts for up to 70% of the total building energy consumption. Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT, big data, cloud computing and machine learning, along with the creation of predictive and proactive digital twins, can help to reduce this number. However, buildings' thermal dynamics is a very complex process that depends on many variables. As a result, commonly used physics-based white box models are time-consuming and require vast expertise. On the contrary, black box forecasting models, which rely primarily on building energy consumption data, lack fundamental insights and hinder re-use.

Current research on digital healthcare has focused on incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and wearable technology to deliver personalized care to the elderly population. Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual models that replicate real-world entities using real-time data and offer new possibilities for personalized healthcare. While prior studies have explored the adaptation of DTs for personalized healthcare, especially for older adults, the integration of generative AI (Gen AI) for real-time contextualized caregiver support remains underdeveloped. This study introduces an Elderly Digital Twin (EDT) framework that places Gen AI-driven personalized feedback and decision support at its core, supported by a comprehensive data pipeline, predictive modeling, and interactive user interaction. The framework integrates diverse physiological data (heart rate, SpO2, and sleep) and demonstrates feasibility and applicability by developing cardiac DT, sleep quality DT, and SpO2 monitoring DT models. Advanced predictive modeling achieved strong performance, with LSTM reaching 92% validation accuracy in sleep stage prediction, and Bi-LSTM yielding robust performance in real-time heart rate forecasting (MSE = 0.2944 and MAE = 0.3410). The EDT framework was deployed via a Node.js-based web application that offers real-time physiological monitoring, interactive 3D cardiac simulation, and GPT-4o-powered personalized feedback to enhance caregiver decision-making and elderly self-management. The primary contribution of this study is the incorporation of Gen AI into EDT to translate sensor data and predictive outputs into actionable recommendations for caregivers.

They are understood to be related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although agriculture suffers the consequences of these changes, it is one of the top global emitters of GHG. While it is complex in environmental, social, and economic aspects, there is a need to advance solutions for more sustainable agriculture. In the farm environment, an important step is the generation of GHG inventories. A GHG inventory is a systematic process for measuring and recording gas emissions and sequestration. However, generating inventories on rural properties presents many challenges due to the many variables involved, such as land use, animal husbandry, use of electricity, and fuels. One of the main challenges is to deal with this data heterogeneity. The data landscape presents obstacles such as managing source diversity, handling massive data volumes, adapting to various data formats, and ensuring real-time integration for decision-making. In this complex data landscape, ontologies emerge as a potential solution. An ontology is defined as a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. This study proposes an ontological model called CarbOnto for the syntactic and semantic integration of heterogeneous databases. Using an ontology, we intend to contribute to the standardization and interpretation of domain concepts and the addition of semantic information to generate complete GHG inventories. CarboOnto provides the means to generate farm inventories, identify imbalances, and search for solutions to neutralize gas emissions.

The IoV has evolved from basic in-vehicle information services to intelligent networking, enhancing perception and decision-making. It is now developing towards coordinated vehicle-infrastructure control with moderate sensing and decision-making. However, the traditional separation of sensing, communication, and computation functions—and even their pairwise integrations, such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), Integrated Communication and Computation (ICC), and Integrated Sensing and Computation (ISC)—create systemic inefficiencies like data redundancy and resource imbalance, which pose a critical bottleneck to the advancement of IoV. The unique characteristics of the IoV, particularly its mission objectives centered on safety and sensing, and the highly dynamic, resource-constrained network environment—compound these systemic inefficiencies, necessitating a dedicated investigation into an IoV-specific ISCC paradigm.

This has enabled precision farming, real-time monitoring, and decision-making that is driven by data. These interconnected systems are susceptible to assaults that could interrupt operations, damage data integrity, and cause financial losses. However, the growing reliance on IIoT devices in farming has also created new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have been developed as a result of the rising reliance on these devices. This research presents an advanced cybersecurity framework that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) with big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) in order to detect attacks and protect smart farming systems. This framework is intended to answer the issues that have been presented. In order to evaluate huge amounts of data that are produced by IIoT devices, the framework makes use of AIpowered techniques such as machine learning and deep learning. This allows for the detection of cyber risks and abnormalities in real time. The use of big data analytics makes it possible to collect and examine a wide variety of data sources, such as sensor data, weather patterns, and the operation of machinery, in order to uncover potentially malicious behaviors and weaknesses inside the system. The framework offers a complete strategy to securing smart farming operations against evolving cyber threats, such as malware assaults, unauthorized access, and data breaches. This is accomplished by combining the predictive capabilities of artificial intelligence with the scalability of big data analytics.

Actual flight paths often deviate from these standard terminal arrival routes due to pilots requesting shortcut arrivals or ATC officers implementing holding procedures to alleviate congestion. These deviations exacerbate the dynamic complexity of air traffic management (ATM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel online learning Transformer-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Transformer-BiGRU) framework for tactical spatiotemporal flight trajectory prediction. BiGRU further obtains bidirectional sequence information to improve the Transformer’s spatiotemporal prediction. The proposed research utilises image processing techniques to produce ATC aeronautical holding instructions from historical automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast data. The framework significantly improves real-time prediction ability and environment adaptability by integrating holding instructions and online learning. Experiment results demonstrate that incorporating holding instructions with the proposed Transformer-BiGRU reduces the mean absolute error by approximately 10% in latitude, 8.9% in longitude, and 13.1% in flight level compared to the best baseline model.

Digital twin networks (DTNs) reinforce this capability by replicating physical entities in real time, supporting intelligent decision-making and global network optimization. However, DTN modeling faces significant challenges, particularly in meeting diverse and dynamic requirements across heterogeneous network domains. Traditional methods often rely on predefined scalar reward functions that compress multi-objective feedback into a single value, limiting interpretability and hindering generalization and adaptability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an intelligence-based reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for adaptive 6G DTN modeling. The method introduces a high-level metric, termed “intelligence,” to quantify cognitive improvement. It models requirements as multi-dimensional random variables and replaces conventional scalar rewards to better capture the complex optimization objectives of DTN modeling. An adaptive multi-granularity modeling framework and its core mechanism are also proposed.

However, an MSA differs from traditional one-off network attacks as it requires a set of sequential stages, whereby each stage may not be malicious when manifested individually, therefore, potentially be underestimated by current IDSs. This work proposes a new approach towards addressing this challenging type of cyber-attacks by employing external sources of information, beyond the conventional use of signatures and monitored network data.

ML models similar to ""K-Nearest Neighbors"", ""Naive Bayes"", and ""Decision trees"" are applied for the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and can classify and provide predictions based on previous datasets of such.

Examples of these applications include floods, earthquakes, and other kinds of natural disasters, such as typhoons. To address this issue, social media data have gradually been adopted to fill possible gaps in the analysis when remote sensing data are lacking or incomplete. In this case, the fusion of heterogeneous big data streams from multiple data sources introduces significant demands from a computational viewpoint. In order to meet these challenges, distributed computing is increasingly viewed as a feasible solution to parallelize the analysis of massive data coming from different sources (e.g., remote sensing and social media data).

From civilian surfers to government managers, each user must not only navigate the vast sea of available data, but also understand it enough to select appropriate data relevant to their unique situation. Over recent years, the MARACOOS data management ecosystem has worked to remove barriers in the initial portion of the user's journey; by centralizing relevant data into one platform, MARACOOS OceansMap, data discovery has become much easier and quicker for mid-Atlantic users. However, decision fatigue quickly sets in as users must still understand and select the appropriate data sources (i.e., models vs. observations), determine which analytical tools are beneficial (i.e., weather window planning vs. validation statistics), and make other decisions to dive deeper into their analyses and interpretations. In this session, we will explore MARACOOS's experiences in combating this issue by providing users with simplified and streamlined solutions, known as Mini Apps. Tailored to distinct stakeholder groups, Mini Apps are powerful tools that provide foundational information and analyses to users, while maintaining enough flexibility that users can further customize, save, and share their own unique version of the app. Leveraging spatial views and in-depth dashboards, Mini Apps currently serve boaters and pilots, surfers, beachgoers, offshore wind developers, the general public as a stakeholder of the offshore wind industry, and other users or researchers interested in studying storm movements and climate change. Our goal in this paper will be to explore how Mini Apps could be leveraged across new stakeholder groups or provide added value to these users, and discuss their scalability across other regions and nations. MARACOOS OceansMap, powered by RPS, is a dynamic data visualization tool integrating near real-time observational assets and model forecasts that contribute to ocean monitoring in the Mid-Atlantic region.

However, with the expansion of the sensing range, the tens of thousands of vehicles and the openness of urban road networks pose a huge challenge for real-time participant recruitment in online VCS systems. To achieve efficient city-scale VCS, this paper proposes Dec-Recruiter, a decentralized framework for online participant recruitment. Specifically, Dec-Recruiter adopts a novel decision-making mode based on virtual grid agents, where vehicles traveling in the same direction within the same grid are considered homogeneous, simplifying the recruitment of specific vehicles to the selection of the number of vehicles in each direction. Meanwhile, through policy sharing among grid agents with the same geographic features, the complexity of city-scale VCS participant recruitment is further reduced. The core of Dec-Recruiter is a multi-agent contextual double-deep Q-network algorithm, which enables grid agents with different geographic features to collaborate on network-wide sensing tasks through their asynchronous decision-making. In this process, the Gaussian function is employed to adjust the reward distribution to address cold-start and data integrity issues in VCS. In addition, to ensure the convergence and training efficiency of the model on large-scale road networks, a pre-training-based transfer learning paradigm is also introduced. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that Dec-Recruiter can effectively recruit appropriate participants in the large-scale VCS and outperforms all baselines.",1558-0016,,10.1109/TITS.2025.3547484,National Key Research and Development Project of China(grant numbers:2022YFB4300400); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10923643,Vehicular crowd sensing;online participant recruitment;large-scale road network;multi-agent reinforcement learning,Sensors;Recruitment;Roads;Data integrity;Trajectory;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Decision making;Vehicle dynamics;Transportation,,15.0,,42.0,IEEE,11 Mar 2025,Oct. 2025,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

By leveraging data-driven modeling, deep neural networks, and spatial intelligence, the framework improves precision in determining energy-specific sites and generates high-resolution suitability maps that demonstrate energy classification accuracies. This research highlights the essence of the proposed framework in providing sustainability outcomes and reducing dependency on non-renewable energy sources for a cleaner, greener, and more eco-friendly environment. Unlike traditional methods and conventional frameworks that rely on single-source datasets, are less adaptive towards integration with geospatial intelligence, and operate as isolated systems, the proposed framework helps save manual efforts, production costs, extensive environmental destruction, and pollution, while leveraging data-driven decision making for identifying high-potential sustainable energy infrastructure development. It also enables real-time data-driven integration with high-precision defined parameters to enhance site recommendation. The proposed framework was evaluated using both proposed and publicly accessible datasets such as NASA POWER Project, SRTM, NGDS, achieving an accuracy exceeding +85%. The framework’s mathematical modeling was assessed using multiple influential factors across distinct energy types.

Verma,"Avaya LLC, McKinney, TX, USA; Government College, Chhachhrauli, Haryana, India","2025 International Conference on Electronics and Computing, Communication Networking Automation Technologies (ICEC2NT)",19 Feb 2026,2025,,,1,6,"Over the years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed numerous industries by facilitating interconnectivity and automation at an unprecedented pace. But the increasing number of connected devices poses major challenges for communication efficiency, cybersecurity, and data transfer reliability. Conventional methods of resource allocation are frequently unable to accommodate changing dynamics within a network, resulting in less-than-optimum performance, security issues, and wasteful bandwidth usage. We focused on the utilization of ML approaches for adaptive resources management to improve the communication, security, and data transmission processes in IoT. The use of machine learning encompasses the adoption of these capabilities through adaptive and intelligent decision making, improving network resource management through the analysis of real-time traffic trends, the prediction of congestion and the dynamic allocation of bandwidth. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a well-established method in the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that can adapt in real-time when combined with deep neural networks (DNN), allowing IoT devices to allocate processing power and communication resources efficiently, minimizing latency and energy consumption with high throughput. Additionally, even more secure ML-based anomaly detection techniques provide a robust cybersecurity approach through the identification of intrusions, the detection of malware, and the prevention of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in IoT environments. The proposed work combines the supervised & unsupervised machine learning models to use supervised models for enhancing efficiency of transmission of data. Decentralized processing techniques, including federated learning and edge AI, decrease reliance on cloud infrastructure and boost privacy. Further, blockchain integration prevents the impossibility of unauthorized in IoT nodes, which can strengthen trust and data integrity in IoT communication.

But this move also makes things a lot more dangerous for cybersecurity. This is because enterprise systems are complicated, they keep data from a lot of different areas, and cyber attacks can get to crucial operational and financial data. Risks in SAP S/4HANA systems are continually changing and are often highly complicated. This makes it challenging for standard security systems to handle them. This is especially true when it comes to countering advanced persistent attacks, discovering fraud, and dealing with insider threats. This study recommends employing a synergistic integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain technology to enhance the security of SAP S/4HANA systems. The major goals are to lower risks, identify fraud, and keep firm data safe. The suggested method leverages AI-powered algorithms to discover unusual behavior, spot fraud tendencies, and guess where attacks might happen in real time. The system is always learning from new datasets due to deep learning and machine learning. This makes it more accurate and cuts down on false positives. Blockchain also makes sure that transactions of business data are open, immutable, and safe. We can keep audit trails safe, maintain track of financial and operational activity, and record sensitive information in a way that can't be changed with distributed ledger technology. This dual link can help businesses stay in line with requirements like GDPR, SOX, and other industry-specific rules while also making their systems safer. SAP S/4HANA is also a safer place to work because AI and blockchain work together. AI helps systems deal with tough problems, and blockchain keeps data safe and makes sure that system activities are checked in a reliable way. When utilized collectively, they can discover fraud in real time, give out early warning signals, and protect the company from hackers from outside and threats from inside. Case studies and experimental simulations demonstrate that this integrated method enhances fraud detection, accelerates its identification, and fosters greater confidence in SAP-driven decision-making across the organization.

However, introducing edge computing to IIoT inevitably results in hybrid intrusion problems and fails to satisfy the security demands of IIoT. Fortunately, Lagrange coded computing has emerged as a low-complexity and low-overhead solution for resisting hybrid intrusions during data offloading and processing. However, how to make decentralized, accurate, and real-time encoding/offloading/decoding decisions remains challenging. This article designs a fully decentralized training and decision-making framework to address the joint secure data offloading and resource allocation problem against hybrid intrusions for dynamic and uncertain IIoT, attempting to minimize the long-run energy and delay costs while improving the data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is proposed a fully decentralized multiagent actor–critic-based secure data offloading (FM-SDO) algorithm to solve the secure data offloading subproblem, wherein each industrial end device utilizes its local information to learn and execute its policy independently. This algorithm improves the structure of actor and critic networks and designs a multiagent alternant updating mechanism to increase learning accuracy, convergence, and stability. Based on the received offloading decisions of each device, each edge server leverages the Lagrange multiplier approach and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition to make fast and decentralized resource allocation decisions. Finally, we employed an IIoT intelligent production line platform named iCandyBox to test the performance of the FM-SDO algorithm.

Studies have recently developed to detect the stress in a person while performing different tasks. One of the methods is through Electroencephalograph (EEG). These are the bioelectrical signals generated in a human body while performing the tasks and thus describes the activity of the brain. Any action taken by a person changes the properties of these signals. This present work focuses on the classification of baseline (relax) and stress detection using EEG sub-band power ratio as features. Support vector machine (SVM) classifier with different kernel function parameters and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with a different number of neighbors with holdout and 10-fold cross-validation technique were used to classify power ratio features in order to detect stress. To evaluate the classifier performance various performance metrics were used. It is observed that KNN with a number of neighbors as one, with Euclidean distance gives better performance in both validation techniques and also anterior frontal channel Fpl that is placed at the left side of the brain itself gives a good accuracy of 99.42%.

However, this requires tremendous efforts and coordination among different sensor network agencies to come to a shared understanding for disseminating the information in a uniform and standardized way. To address these needs and achieve interoperability, syntactic standardization provides to a certain extent the data description models. In addition, semantic enrichment of the information sources is also required to understand the context of the data. In this paper we adopt standardized data models based on the Open Geospatial Consoritum (OGC) sensor web enablement framework for coastal sensor networks, which facilitates improved information retrieval on a variety of spatio-temporal scales. The semantic enrichment is achieved in terms of conceptualization of selected sensor types and other terminology involved in the coastal domain in the form of Ontologies. A coastal semantic mapping (COSEM-Map) tool developed as a part of this work facilitates the harmonization of different representations. This ontological model is amenable to querying using SPARQL, which is a standardized RDF query language.

Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles. The system’s coordination and automation capabilities ensure efficient information flow and seamless coordination across sensing, communication, decision-making, and action stages.",,978-1-6654-7477-1,10.1109/UV56588.2022.10185519,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10185519,smart home;vulnerable group support;homeless support;chronic disease management;senior care;independent living;smart energy management;smart infrastructure support;smart response system for urgent situations;smart mobility;smart humanity;information flow;material cycle;smart lifestyle management;smart community user acceptance;Universal Village;smart monitoring;smart activity understanding;human-computer interaction;computer vision;machine learning;safety and security;adversarial attach;reinforcement learning;adaptive control;system theory;dynamic relationship;coordination & automation;closed feedback loop;robustness & resilience;sustainability,Home appliances;Smart cities;Decision making;Smart homes;Medical services;Safety;Older adults,,3.0,,471.0,IEEE,26 Jul 2023,22-25 Oct. 2022,22-25 Oct. 2022,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Sleipnir: Multi-agent based stock operator framework with interpretability,X. Qian; S. Chen; Z. Sun,"Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China; Thomas More Prep-Marian High School, 1701 Hall Street Hays, Kansas, USA; Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China",IEEE Access,,2026,PP,99.0,1,1,"The increasing complexity and volatility of modern financial markets have exposed fundamental limitations in traditional investment decision-making systems, which struggle to capture nonlinear market dynamics and adapt to rapidly evolving conditions. While deep learning approaches have shown promise in financial modeling, existing single-model frameworks remain inadequate for handling the multifaceted nature of contemporary markets, including cross-asset contagion effects, multimodal data integration, and the need for interpretable decision-making that complies with regulatory transparency requirements. To address these challenges, we propose Sleipnir, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that replaces monolithic architectures with a debate-driven ensemble of heterogeneous agents powered by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek-Reasoning). To establish a scalable and interpretable automated investment system, our framework 1) introduces an Interface Module for orchestrating multi-agent collaboration via strategic leader-follower coordination, 2) deploys a Dynamic Router for intelligent agent selection based on market conditions and query complexity, 3) integrates a ReAct Module to deliver tool-augmented analytical capabilities, and 4) implements a Reflect Module that enables interpretable decision tracing through atomic operation decomposition. Furthermore, the system incorporates a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that dynamically correlates macro-level news events with micro-level trading patterns, supporting minute-level market responsiveness. Our framework delivers three principal advances: 1) a multi-agent collaborative architecture that combines consensus-driven decision-making with specialized investment perspectives, 2) a RAG-enhanced real-time intelligence engine equipped with time-adaptive retrieval mechanisms, and 3) an interpretable decision-tracing system that provides transparent, auditable reasoning paths while ensuring regulatory compliance. Comprehensive evaluation across NIO stock (a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index (2024), high-frequency Bitcoin (BTC) trading data, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and diverse investor profiles demonstrates substantial improvements: 38.7% Sharpe ratio enhancement, reduced maximum drawdown, and superior diversification. In cryptocurrency trading, the framework achieved 0.67% returns versus 0.35% buy-and-hold with -0.82% maximum drawdown, while reducing computational costs and providing confidence-calibrated allocation strategies.

To this purpose, we propose a novel Occupancy Grid (OG) mapping framework, based on an adaptation to the standard OG method. The method iteratively builds an OG map from successive acoustic measurements. The resulting maps, produced in real-time by each robot, show the probability of each grid cell containing a target. The algorithm is designed to handle the presence of multiple targets and takes into account a dynamic world (moving targets). Albeit generic, the proposed method was adapted to work with passive sonar sensors that produce bearing-only measurements. Results from simulations demonstrate the capability of the method to create maps showing regions likely containing targets.

Fusing an ensemble of diverse prognostic life predictions,O. W. Laslett; A. R. Mills; M. A. Zaidan; R. F. Harrison,"The University of Sheffield Sheffield, UK; The University of Sheffield Sheffield, UK; The University of Sheffield Sheffield, UK; The University of Sheffield Sheffield, UK",2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference,19 Jun 2014,2014,,,1,10,"Prognosis refers to the production of bounded estimates for the remaining useful life (RUL) of a component or system. Robust prognosis within well defined uncertainty bounds promises the ability to lower system sustainment costs and improve maintenance decision making. In ideal scenarios, the degradation of many assets is predictable from measurements taken during operation. These measurements, accompanied by appropriate knowledge, have been successfully used with various prognostic trending and prediction techniques to estimate the remaining useful life. However, there are scenarios where changes in operating environment or emerging fault modes can alter the degradation path an asset takes and thus invalidate previous predictions. One approach to overcoming these challenges is to develop prognostic techniques sensitive to change, however this sensitivity must be traded for robustness to imperfect degradation measurements. As an alternative, we develop multiple predictors, each with differing properties so that multiple estimates can be made based on different possible scenarios. A data fusion architecture is presented that combines multiple prognostic techniques weighted by their individual prediction uncertainty for the remaining useful life of an asset. The architecture is based on the concept of an ensemble Kalman Filter with an adaptive error co-variance parameter. The parameter is updated in real-time with the prediction variances produced by the set of prognostic predictions. Using real civil aerospace data, the technique is demonstrated to provide an amalgamated estimate of RUL to a fleet management operator. The developed architecture provides improved decision support to fleet maintainers in comparison to existing single prognostic technique methods.",1095-323X,978-1-4799-1622-1,10.1109/AERO.2014.6836267,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836267,,Trajectory;Kalman filters;Degradation;Noise;Data models;Mathematical model;Predictive models,,5.0,,29.0,IEEE,19 Jun 2014,1-8 March 2014,1-8 March 2014,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Dynamic Weighted Multimodal Financial Forecasting Models: Fusion Strategies and Market Validation,D. Yue,"Business School, Xiamen Institute of Technology, Fujian, China","2025 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Internet and Digital Economy (ICAID)",17 Jun 2025,2025,,,60,66,"The complexity and multi-source heterogeneous nature of financial markets pose challenges to traditional prediction models, where a critical challenge lies in effectively integrating multi-modal data and dynamically capturing the evolution of market states. Addressing the limitations of existing financial prediction models that rely on static weighting or singlemodal data, this paper proposes a Dynamic Weighting Multimodal Fusion (DWMF) framework. The model introduces an attention mechanism-based dynamic weighting allocation module to analyze real-time information contributions from multi-modal data, including market volatility, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic events. It adaptively adjusts fusion weights of different modalities in time-series forecasting. Furthermore, adversarial training strategies are incorporated to enhance feature representation robustness, while Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are employed to capture cross-modal temporal dependencies. Empirical studies on the A-share and U.S. stock markets validate the framework through multi-scenario tests using the CSI 300 Index, S&P 500 constituent stocks, and social media sentiment data. Results demonstrate that compared to static fusion models and single-modal benchmarks, DWMF reduces prediction errors by an average of $25.4 \%$, improves the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) by $\mathbf{3 8. 5 \%}$, and exhibits superior robustness during extreme market fluctuations. Additionally, a coupling effect is identified between enhanced pricing efficiency and volatility suppression, with the model achieving $83 \%$ of information pricing within one hour following a policy shock. This study establishes a dynamic decision-making paradigm for multi-modal financial data fusion, while its modular architecture demonstrates scalability for cross-market and cross-asset prediction tasks.",,979-8-3315-1066-4,10.1109/ICAID65275.2025.11034630,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11034630,Dynamic weighting;Multi-modal finance;Fusion forecasting,Training;Adaptation models;Social networking (online);Biological system modeling;Pricing;Predictive models;Data models;Robustness;Forecasting;Stock markets,,2.0,,25.0,IEEE,17 Jun 2025,25-27 April 2025,25-27 April 2025,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Traditional sentiment analysis models often struggle with understanding the nuanced and context-dependent nature of social media posts, which are typically short, informal, and laden with slang, emojis, and abbreviations. To address these challenges, this research proposes a Context-Aware Sentiment Analysis model leveraging a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN) integrated with an Attention Mechanism. The BiRNN captures dependencies in both forward and backward sequences, effectively learning the contextual flow of information. The attention mechanism further enhances model interpretability by focusing on the most informative words contributing to sentiment classification. The proposed model was trained and evaluated on benchmark datasets such as Twitter Sentiment140 and SemEval 2017 Task 4A, achieving an accuracy of 89.6% and F1-score of 88.2% on Sentiment140, and 86.4% accuracy with an F1-score of 85.1% on SemEval, outperforming baseline methods including unidirectional RNNs and CNN-based models by a margin of 4-6% in F1-score. Visualization of attention weights provided insights into how the model emphasizes contextually significant words and phrases, improving interpretability for end-users. The model also demonstrated robustness against noisy and ambiguous data prevalent in social media streams.

Existing insulin dosing models based solely on electronic health records (EHR) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data fail to account for the effects of high-dose glucocorticoid tapering, which significantly impacts glucose control. Additionally, few platforms can seamlessly integrate structured clinical data with patient-reported inputs, limiting their utility for real-time decision-making and AIdriven insulin predictions. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-phase clinical study in collaboration with IBM and Cleveland Clinic. In phase 1, we retrospectively analyzed EHR and CGM data to examine how glucocorticoid tapering influenced insulin requirements. This analysis highlighted the need to incorporate additional factors-such as meal intake, activity levels, and sleep quality-to improve predictive modeling. In phase 2, we developed a customized Health Guardian (HG) web application to collect patient-reported measures. We also refined t he HG data pipeline to integrate EHR, CGM, and patient-reported data into a centralized PostgreSQL database, enabling realtime visualization through both clinician and patient interfaces.

These services are extents across various industries and applications, enhancing efficiency and decision-making through real-time data collection and analysis. In IoT services, authentication ensures that devices, users, and systems verify every other's individuality. It process is critical for establishing secure and trusted connections, preventing unauthorized access by malicious users. Context-aware authentication for IoT services improves security by incorporating contextual information during the authentication process. Hybridization of Segmented Regressive Signcryption and Extreme Learning Authentication (HSRS-ELA) Model proposed to enhance the security of context-sensitive IoT services with higher confidentiality and integrity. The proposed HSRS-ELM method includes four major processes. Initially, user information and web service lists are collected from the dataset. Via IoT device, user broadcast request toward cloud server. The server computes the priority of the request using a segmented regression function. High-priority requests are then served first than the others. For each user, a Congruential ephemeral key generation process is carried out to generate private and public keys. Next, the signcryption process is executed, which combines encryption and digital signature generation. For ensuring secure transmission, encrypted service information as well as signature convey toward receiver. The extreme learning machine (ELM) is then applied to verify both the signature and the context information of the users in the authentication process. If the verification is successful, the server grants access to the requested web services. Otherwise, the server denies access to the user. Finally, confidentiality and integrity is achieved during web service transmission. Experimental evaluations are conducted on metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confidentiality, integrity, computational overhead, and latency.

This study constructs a data-driven research route planning framework, which integrates multi-source heterogeneous data through a Time Series Graph Neural Network (TGNN) to achieve deep correlation modeling of topic evolution, resource allocation, and achievement output. The framework design includes a four layer architecture consisting of data layer, feature engineering layer, association modeling layer, and visualization application layer.

One of the main barriers to its full implementation is the lack of interoperable and automated inspection systems capable of detecting errors and enabling data feedback, with the potential for integration into closed-loop control systems. This article presents an integrated approach for the dimensional and geometric inspection of parts produced by additive manufacturing, combining a UR5e collaborative robot with a machine vision system.

Subsequently, these models were digitized using Matlab GUI tools, allowing us to assess two types of scenarios $(R_{0} > 1$ and $R_{0} < 1)$ to analyze the impact of key variables such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of Botrytis spores on disease incidence and severity. Furthermore, digitizing these models facilitates real-time data integration, including information from automated weather stations and field sensors. This enhances prediction accuracy and responsiveness to environmental changes. The developed model and its eventual validation emerge as a valuable tool for viticulturists and oenologists. It provides crucial information enabling them to make informed decisions regarding Botrytis management and control practices, thereby contributing to the enhancement of vineyard productivity.",2832-1537,979-8-3503-6953-3,10.1109/CHILECON60335.2023.10418676,University of Talca(grant numbers:300758/2022-7); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10418676,Wine grape;Botrytis cinerea;Dynamic model;Phenology and Phytopatology,Temperature sensors;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Pipelines;Predictive models;Data models;Matlab,,1.0,,27.0,IEEE,15 Feb 2024,5-7 Dec. 2023,5-7 Dec. 2023,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Relative to traditional ArcGIS, ENVI, and ERDAS IMAGINE style desktop software that have limited scalability, performance, data integration, and licensing challenges, GEE provides parallel processing at a high level of performance and accessing data at a petabyte scale, and APIs enabling automation. The mapping process entails Sentinel-2 multispectral (10-20 m) data (level 2 processed) and Landsat-8 OLI data integrated in GEE with cloud masking and radiometric calibration as preprocessing steps. The Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping was carried out based on the supervised classification through CART and Random Forest algorithms, with an overall accuracy of 92.53 percent and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91, and the accuracy of the 1,000 validation samples. NIR-NDVI and SAVI indices were used to classify the crop health, and temporal NDVI trends and phenological measures were used to predict yield. The comparative analysis indicates that the time spent on processing with the use of GEE is more than 70 percent shorter than the desktop workflow, allowing for conducting near-real-time tracking, as well as data sharing. Although it has been demonstrated to be efficient, Scopus-collected literature has shown that there is minimal use of GEE in agricultural studies ($<2$ percent of the accessed LULC research articles), implying there is room to broadly adopt in the application of agricultural studies in regions where climate variability, food insecurity, and infrastructure inadequacy prevail.",2769-2884,979-8-3315-5421-7,10.1109/ICRITO66076.2025.11241624,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11241624,Google Earth Engine;Agriculture;LULC;Classifier;Satellite dataset,Earth;Accuracy;Clouds;Scalability;Satellite broadcasting;Market research;Software;Internet;Engines;Monitoring,,,,24.0,IEEE,27 Nov 2025,18-19 Sept. 2025,18-19 Sept. 2025,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Early detection and personalized intervention are crucial yet challenging due to the limited accessibility and scalability of traditional diagnostic methods. Building upon our previous work on gait-based assessment, this study presents a novel framework for early sarcopenia-prone risk detection using the five-time sit-to-stand (5TSTS) test, embodying Healthcare Industry 5.0’s vision of mass personalization with human-centered technology. Utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) and advanced analytics, our system segments 5TSTS into four biomechanically significant submotions [standing up (StU), standing transition (StT), sitting down (SiD), and sitting transition (SiT)]. This granular segmentation allows mass personalization in diagnostic evaluations by capturing individual-specific biomechanical profiles via wavelet-based feature extraction and machine learning (ML) techniques. Our framework employs big data analytics tools, including the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based feature selection and support vector machine synthetic minority oversampling technique (SVMSMOTE), to handle class imbalance and optimize individualized predictive accuracy. Tested on data from 52 elderly participants (aged 65–84 years), the system achieves outstanding personalized classification accuracy—up to 97.97% for multiclass risk stratification and 99.28% for binary (healthy versus sarcopenia-prone) classification—highlighting its potential for precise, patient-specific clinical decision-making. Furthermore, the wireless capability of our IoT-enabled wearable IMUs, coupled with minimal setup requirements, facilitates seamless data integration into cloud-based healthcare systems.

We optimize the average AoCI at the data fusion center (DFC) by appropriately managing the energy harvested by sensors, whose true battery states are unobservable during the decision-making process. Particularly, we first formulate the dynamic status update procedure as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where the environmental dynamics are unknown to the DFC. In order to address the challenges arising from the causality of energy usage, unknown environmental dynamics, unobservability of sensors’ true battery states, and large-scale discrete action space, we devise a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dynamic status update algorithm.

At its core is the sensing-to-action loop, which iteratively aligns sensor inputs with computational models to drive adaptive control strategies. These loops can adapt to hyper-local conditions, enhancing resource efficiency and responsiveness, but also face challenges such as resource constraints, synchronization delays in multimodal data fusion, and the risk of cascading errors in feedback loops. This article explores how proactive, context-aware sensing-to-action and action-to-sensing adaptations can enhance efficiency by dynamically adjusting sensing and computation based on task demands, such as sensing a very limited part of the environment and predicting the rest. By guiding sensing through control actions, action-to-sensing pathways can improve task relevance and resource use, but they also require robust monitoring to prevent cascading errors and maintain reliability. Multi-agent sensing-action loops further extend these capabilities through coordinated sensing and actions across distributed agents, optimizing resource use via collaboration. Additionally, neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological systems, provides an efficient framework for spike-based, event-driven processing that conserves energy, reduces latency, and supports hierarchical control-making it ideal for multi-agent optimization.

The growth of the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid development of technologies such as short range mobile communication and improved energy-efficiency is expected to create a pervasive connection of “things.” This will inevitably result in the generation of enormous amount of data, which have to be stored, processed, and accessed. Cloud computing has long been recognized as a paradigm for big data storage and analytics. The combination of cloud computing and IoT can enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual things, thus stimulating innovations in both fields. For example, cloud platforms allow the sensing data to be stored and used intelligently for smart monitoring and actuation with the smart devices. Novel data fusion algorithms, machine learning methods, and artificial intelligence techniques can be implemented and run centralized or distributed on the cloud to achieve automated decision making. These will boost the development of new applications, such as smart cities, grids, and transportation systems.

Open Networks: Generalized Multi-Sensor Characterization,A. N. Steinberg,"CUBRC, Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA",2006 9th International Conference on Information Fusion,12 Feb 2007,2006,,,1,7,"This paper examines issues in characterizing the performance of information sources as necessary for data fusion and coordination in a net-centric environment. In many practical applications, interacting agents have various degrees-and possibly time-varying degrees-of allegiance, common purpose, cooperativeness, information fidelity, controllability, etc. Agents share information with friends, foes and innocent bystanders alike, with varying degrees of cooperativeness and openness. In such cases, each network node needs to explicitly estimate the performance, trustworthiness and allegiance of all other contributing nodes as a part of the general multi-sensor/multi-target state estimation process. A sensor's or information system's reporting bias-which may include intentional or unintentional human biases-is distinguished from its measurement bias. The problem is compared with that of measurement bias estimation, e.g. in target tracking. Formulations for estimation of biases in discrete variable reporting-e.g. in target classification or activity state reporting-are explored",,1-4244-0953-5,10.1109/ICIF.2006.301665,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085951,reporting bias;situation assessment;threat assessment;closed-loop data fusion;network-centric warfare;network-centric operations;sensor/source characterization;data alignment;registration;calibration;information warfare,State estimation;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Calibration;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Controllability;Military computing;Humans;Target tracking;Libraries,,5.0,,23.0,,12 Feb 2007,10-13 July 2006,10-13 July 2006,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Resource Management for Netcentric Environments,S. Das,"Charles River Analytics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA",2006 9th International Conference on Information Fusion,12 Feb 2007,2006,,,1,3,"The military resource management problem involves timely distribution and placement of materiel, personnel, and sensor assets to accommodate mission requirements throughout the world. The resource management problem of today's US military is perhaps the largest and most complex optimization problem in terms of the number of variables representing various resource types and constraints relating the variables. This modern resource management problem needs to be considered within a network centric warfare (NCW) environment, and hence the term ""sense and respond logistics"" (S&RL). In this article, the author views the resource management issue as intimately related to the problem of planning and scheduling of tasks, that is, one cannot effectively reason with resources in isolation. In the data fusion domain, this view translates to consideration of the collection management process during situation/threat assessment and courses-of-action generation processes. Within a NCW environment a node must proactively determine mission requirements based on the current situation and threat, and then coordinate with other nodes to meet those requirements via some communication mechanism (e.g. publish and subscribe) on the underlying infrastructure. The specific algorithmic approach the author advocates for dynamically managing resources is essentially based on constraint programming (CP) techniques, where constraints are declaratively stated and placed on the types and quantities of resources at hand. The constraints can also be dynamically added or retracted from the system, thus are suitable to meet the demands of a dynamic resource management environment. The approach distinguishes between consumable and non-consumable resources, and in some situations views time as a special kind of resource. The author illustrates the CP approach to resource management in NCW environments in terms of two examples. The first example is related to surveillance asset management and the second is related to logistics",,1-4244-0953-5,10.1109/ICIF.2006.301793,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086079,Resource Management;Sense & Respond Logistics;Network Centric Warfare;Planning & Scheduling;Constraint Programming,Resource management;Dynamic programming;Logistics;Rivers;Personnel;Constraint optimization;Communication effectiveness;Fusion power generation;Surveillance;Asset management,,,,6.0,,12 Feb 2007,10-13 July 2006,10-13 July 2006,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Propagation of signals from spatially separated radars through differing atmospheric environments, however, can introduce significant errors in target positioning and ranging. For example, simulations illustrate that two radars separated by 100 km viewing the same single target through different tropospheres could place the single target in positions separated by over 200 m. Attempts at fusing the data and resolving the information into a single object could result in operational deficiencies due to classification and discrimination errors. Additionally, anomalous propagation conditions such as tropospheric ducting can lead to radar coverage holes and hence the perception of faulty radars and system level fusion errors. These errors must be characterized and, as far as possible, eliminated if the operational effectiveness of cooperative radar engagements and capabilities are to be optimized.

To facilitate situation assessment, we investigate the problem of jointly classifying and identifying multiple targets in radar sensor networks where the maximum number of categories and the maximum number of targets in each category are obtained a priori based on statistical data. However, the actual number of targets in each category and the actual number of target categories being present at any given time are assumed unknown.

Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (T&E) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the T&E community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.The true product of T&E is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the T&E community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during T&E. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace. The net result of these commercial best practices is a solid foundation for the DoD to transform how it uses data to achieve faster, better, and smarter decisions throughout the acquisition lifecycle.",,978-1-5386-5035-6,10.1109/BigData.2018.8622388,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622388,Big Data;Data Analytics;Knowledge Management;Data Management;Virtualization;Cloud Computing;Predictive Maintainance;Department of Defense;Test and Evaluation,Big Data;Knowledge management;Tools;US Department of Defense;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Data analysis,,5.0,,0.0,IEEE,24 Jan 2019,10-13 Dec. 2018,10-13 Dec. 2018,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Since the huge business and research value behind the large-scale data, big data technology has become one of the hotest research fields in academia and industry. To the big data, storing and processing the data is core function of the file systems. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the most typical distributed big data architecture, which has the characteristics of high reliability, high fault tolerance, and low hardware cost. HDFS provides the efficient task implementation and fault tolerance among nodes by Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism. However, the traditional RPC mechanism has remarkable defects with the fixed timing method, and cannot quickly establish the relationship between node downtime and network congestion. In this paper, we propose an improved adaptive RPC mechanism for node fault tolerance and performance. The proposed method classifies nodes by the data block access statistic, and dynamically adjusts the RPC interval time. This method can be used to reduce the networking traffic and processing pressure of NameNode nodes, and improve the I/O and task performance.

Challenged by large-scale private data collected from user side, GNN may not be able to reflect the excellent performance, without rich features and complete adjacent relationships. Addressing the problem, vertical federated learning (VFL) is proposed to implement local data protection through training a global model collaboratively. Consequently, for graph-structured data, it is a natural idea to construct a GNN-based VFL (GVFL) framework. However, GNN has been proven vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Whether the vulnerability will be brought into the GVFL has not been studied. This is the first study of adversarial attacks on GVFL. A novel adversarial attack method is proposed, named Graph-Fraudster. It generates adversarial perturbations based on the noise-added global node embeddings via the privacy leakage and the gradient of pairwise node. Specifically, first, Graph-Fraudster steals the global node embeddings and sets up a shadow model of the server for the attack generator. Second, noise is added into node embeddings to confuse the shadow model. Finally, the gradient of pairwise node is used to generate attacks with the guidance of noise-added node embeddings. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Fraudster achieves the state-of-the-art attack performance compared with baselines in different GNN based GVFLs. Furthermore, Graph-Fraudster can remain a threat to GVFL even if two possible defense mechanisms are applied. In addition, some suggestions are put forward for the future work to improve the robustness of GVFL.

The biggest challenge to build this tool was to make most of the functions, modules, libraries and even workflow schemes (nearly) compatible between frameworks and to make a multipurpose single Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Big Data availlable in the desktop and on the cloud. The development of the HGrid library starts with the collection of functions needed, how they can be implemented in each framework and how the codes can be generated. HGrid generated codes were also benchmarked against some commercially availlable tools to ensure good performance. HGrid is also designed to be visual, robust and user friendly although it still need to be improved in user experience part. It is also designed for average programmers and analysts. Data engineering libraries has been continuosly developed to ease application development with target near zero programming at the programmers side.

Modern investors use variety of tools to take informed investment decisions. In the current era of digital world, financial service industry has generated huge volume and immense verities of data with extreme speed. Due to the rapid growth in data collection and the heterogeneous nature and complexity of the data, there is a need for Big Data analytical solution that would be able to deal with the stock market data. Large volumes of unstructured, heterogeneous raw data can be stored in a massively scalable manner using data lakes, which are the ideal solution to the big data storage conundrum. The ability of a data lake to preserve data in its original format while processing it at runtime using a schema on-read technique is its key feature. The challenge faced in the data lake is performing analytics which is a significant tool to calculate and analyze the stock market. The proposed architecture of Azure Databricks DeltaLake (ADDL) with Azure DataLake Storage Generation 2 (ADLSG2) is used for analytical processes like Fibonacci retracement for better stock analysis, which aid in forecasting the market price for better investment. As a result, the research focus is to produce a storage having read as well as write capabilities by taking into consideration the Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) operation on the datasource. In this experimental databricks implementation, runtime is performed using open source of Apache Spark API and a highly improved execution engine, which results in a significant performance improvement when comparing to the standard source of Apache Spark available on the ADLS platform.

We aim to design Foreseer, an extensible framework, to design and evaluate identity matching techniques for public, large, and low-accuracy operational data. Foreseer consists of three functionally independent components designed to address the issues of discovery and preparation, storage and representation, and analysis and linking of traces from disparate online sources. The framework includes a domain specific language for manipulating traces, generating insights, and building novel services. We have applied it in a pilot study of roughly 10TB of data from Twitter, Reddit, and StackExchange including roughly 6M distinct entities and, using basic matching techniques, found roughly 83,000 matches among these sources.

In view of the sanctions currently imposed on the Russian Federation, it is worth considering mainly open projects and/or domestic developments. We will highlight the main criteria that it is desirable to take into account when designing the architecture of an automated system to support the synthesis of new technical systems and technologies: (a) ability to store and process large amounts of data; (b) unification access for all data analysis procedures; (c) maximum automation of all stages; (d) modularity of the structure, focus on the expansion of functionality; (e) focus on open source solutions and software of domestic manufacturers, excluding rigid binding to paid foreign solutions. As a result of the work done, various aspects of the implementation of the required automated system were analyzed. A review of various software systems and cloud products showed that the concept of building data lakes (Data Lake) in conjunction with the distributed processing tools of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem is used for big data processing. An architecture framework based on a centralized data warehouse and Hadoop components is proposed. It will be possible to increase the functionality of the platform by adding new microservices that connect to the storage and distributed processing tools via the API, as well as using a single web service for managing and displaying data analysis results from these microservices.",,978-1-6654-6429-1,10.1109/SmartIndustryCon57312.2023.10110764,Russian Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10110764,architecture;physical knowledge;information support;search design,Distributed processing;Data analysis;Web services;Architecture;Ecosystems;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture,,3.0,,20.0,IEEE,1 May 2023,27-31 March 2023,27-31 March 2023,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Optical telemetry services will play a key role to enable advanced network awareness at device and component granularity. Optical disaggregation is pushing the adoption of open models, enabling multi-vendor interoperability, including telemetry. Moreover, due to whitebox programmability and the adoption of open source micro services, it is becoming feasible to monitor data streams from optical devices related to quality of transmission key performance indicators. Finally, due to mature big data analytics platforms, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, the telemetry data lake is processed to effectively detect network anomalies. However, current centralized telemetry architectures are prone to scalability issues, suboptimal soft failure recovery due to operational mode limitations, and/or the inability of the SDN controller of tuning finer or proprietary transmission parameters. Conversely, a number of soft failures might be detected and recovered directly at the optical card transmitter, often in a hitless fashion, also relying on optimized vendor-proprietary configurations.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid reputation system (HDRS) which allows vehicles and roadside units (RSU) to complete reputation evaluations separately and provide references to each other. HDRS utilizes a reliability evaluation module to filter out unreliable calculation results and reference records. Furthermore, HDRS includes a dynamic adjustment mechanism for the reputation update interval, employing Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and reliability evaluation results to resist intelligent attacks.

Network System of Systems Manager,J. Dobie; R. Holder,"L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Melbourn, Florida; L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Melbourn, Florida","2024 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)",11 Jun 2024,2024,,,1,14,"For several decades, the L3Harris Mission Networks organization has perfected the design, deployment, operations, and management of enterprise-level networks for safety-critical missions using a managed service framework. L3Harris has successfully constructed geographically large and technologically diverse Local Area Network (LAN)/Wide Area Network (WAN) solutions for State and Federal customers by selecting, optimizing, and integrating Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) products and services into an integrated or homogeneous solution meeting exacting performance requirements. These purpose-built network solutions ensure performance and resilience through tailored provisioning and the configuration of highly reliable (e.g., through adaptive redundancy) architectures, diverse service connections and equipment, ubiquitous bandwidth allocation and an unparalleled telecommunication provider governance by a centralized operational support system.Over this same period, there have been key advances in the networking industry which signal the need to evolve beyond our centralized managed services model. These advances include the rapid industry transition from a dedicated Time-division Multiple Access (TDMA)-based solution to multifunction IP-based networks with Quality of Service (QoS) support, the growing deployment of Software Defined Everything (SDE), AI-assisted advanced modeling and simulation, near-universal adoption of cloud-based Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), design patterns and deployment solutions with the increasing presence of wireless services such as 5G (both fixed and mobile), Long Term Evolution (LTE), Geostationary Orbit (GEO), Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO).Within these evolving technologies, network management solutions can move from centralized to federated architectures with the promise of effortless scalability, dynamic adaptability, and seamless collaboration. A federated hierarchical architecture offers organizations a blueprint allowing coordinated management, interoperability of data, resources and processes across heterogeneous systems, locations, and organizational boundaries. To take maximum advantage of such an architecture, we believe there is an opportunity to streamline and optimize network designs through an implementation of a Network System of Systems Manager (NSoSM). The NSoSM is a centralized system used to ingest network telemetry data across one or more networks, process data via AI/ML algorithms, to make informed decisions to improve the delivery of prioritized customer data and improve the usability of mission critical customer applications.The federated architecture construct, consisting of loosely coupled constituent databases for sharing and data exchange, has evolved beyond its origin and the set of standards facilitating its integration. The use of an Open Platform Communications (OPC) Unified Architecture (UA) [01], the International Society of Automation (ISA)-95 model [02], the Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association (MESA) Business to Manufacturing Markup Language (B2MML) [03], and message exchange models have improved integration and scalability, resulting in wide adoption in manufacturing environments.The adoption of a federated architecture in enterprise-level, mission critical networks present several challenges. The solution to these challenges can be addressed with three primary capabilities: 1) Integrated Situational Awareness; 2) Integration Gateway, and 3) AI Augmentation and Automated Orchestration, carrying independent value and, when fused together, achieve a NSoSM which autonomously supports a federated ecosystem:Integrated Situational Awareness. Adapting to the increasing volume of technological solutions, the need for highly customized service integrator solutions evolves from a centralized integration of disparate platforms to an enterprise orchestration of integrated System-of-Systems (SoS). This is achieved through creating a hyperconverged monitoring and data collection capability of system logs, synthetic network probes, streaming telemetry and real-time channel performance metrics collected by Fault Management Systems, Network Performance Monitoring and Diagnostics Systems, and Application Performance Monitoring systems. Integrating these COTS solutions, together with Situational Awareness, offer end-to-end (E2E) planning, fault analysis, and command and control (C2) of regulated network environments.Integration Gateway. Of critical importance in the NSoSM model is the need to create a homogeneous, clear user experience across a heterogeneous collection of federated systems. This involves the definition and harmonization of the exchanged data and the technologies used for sending and receiving the exchanged data with intelligent markers to incorporate customer and mission-defined, protections. This involves both the harmonization of data from dissimilar heterogeneous end-systems to a common operating picture and to convert it back to native system languages when suggested configurations are being recommended to optimize customer service performance.AI Augmentation and Automated Orchestration (AIA2O). This capability is comprised of three primary and sequential functions: Datasets, Frameworks and Procedure Validation for AIOps and Command and Control (C2) Orchestration. Data from the Integration Gateway is interpreted into logical threads where Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and models apply insight to optimizations required for an improved User Experience (UX), via autonomous orchestration, reducing and sometimes eliminating the human-in-the-loop delay not only reducing the decision chain but also reducing human error. Insights and procedures are validated in a digital twin representation followed by the orchestration of optimizations in a production environment.The Federal Aviation Administration’s publication of Initial Concept of Operations for an Info-Centric National Airspace System asserts that ""The integrated information environment, providing data services including data integration from various sources, allows federated actors to reconcile, contextualize, and share relevant information’’. Additionally, value is perceived by enabling ""multiple entities to provide a federated set of xTM services for flights operating within the same airspace"". Implementing and operating NSoSM capabilities, comprised of an integrated gateway, integrated situational awareness, and AI augmentation and automated orchestration are at the core of where mission critical, enterprise-level networks and SDE are evolving for State, Federal, and Department of Defense (DoD) organizations. L3Harris’ approach to the design of a NSoSM solution provides a limitless overlay adapting to emerging and evolving technologies, meanwhile reduce operating expenses (OpEx) via an ever-growing AI community, enabling independent systems to collectively deliver value that cannot be achieved independently.",2155-4951,979-8-3503-9309-5,10.1109/ICNS60906.2024.10550591,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550591,Network Automation;Machine Learning;Autonomous Networking;Network Data Analytics;Situational Awareness,Command and control systems;Adaptive systems;Mission critical systems;Computer architecture;Organizations;Logic gates;User experience,,2.0,,12.0,IEEE,11 Jun 2024,23-25 April 2024,23-25 April 2024,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Conventional firefighting strategies often require direct human intervention in hazardous environments, exposing personnel to life-threatening conditions and limiting the efficiency of emergency responses. To address these challenges, this research presents an IoT-enabled hybrid robotic firefighting framework that integrates multi-sensor fire detection, rule-based autonomy, and dual suppression mechanisms for enhanced industrial safety. A sensor fusion scheme combining flame, smoke, temperature, and vision modalities enables reliable fire detection and localization, while finite-state behavioural logic governs autonomous navigation, suppression mode selection and operator override. Dual suppression agents—water and Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF)—provide adaptability across Class A and Class B fire scenarios. Experimental validation under controlled flame conditions demonstrated detection latencies of 1.1–2.3 s across distances up to 50 cm, suppression coverage of 0.11–0.15 m2, and real-time situational monitoring with 200–300 ms video latency. These results confirm the feasibility of low-cost, rule-based robotic firefighting solutions in constrained industrial environments.The originality of this study does not lie in the isolated use of commercially available components, but in their systematic integration into a coherent, application-oriented framework tailored to industrial safety in resource-limited regions.

While most commercially available surveillance systems have to be managed by human operators, who constantly monitor all video streams, several experimental systems from different research groups already include robust video processing approaches for (semi-) automated surveillance. Still, most research activities focus on a sensororiented approach to video analytics of large and distributed camera networks, aiming to extract, analyze and store all extractable information from the video streams. In real-life applications, however, only a limited set of specific threats needs to be covered. Accordingly, only a small subset of potentially extractable information has to be monitored. Besides the huge amount of raw video data, modern surveillance systems are also extended with other sensors that deliver even more data. As a consequence, a new paradigm is introduced, called task-oriented information and data processing for surveillance systems. In the proposed system NEST (Network Enabled Surveillance and Tracking) following the task-oriented approach, every resource allocation, data acquisition, and analysis process is assigned to a specific surveillance task.

Correctly identifying duplicate records that represent the same entity, such as user, customer, patient and so on, a process commonly known as record linkage, can improve service levels, accelerate sales, or elevate healthcare decision support. Towards this direction, blocking methods are used with the aim to group matching records in the same block using a combination of their attributes as blocking keys. This paper introduces a suite of randomized algorithms specifically crafted for streaming record linkage settings. Using a bounded in-memory data structure, in terms of the number of blocks and positions within each block, our algorithms guarantee that the most frequently accessed and the most recently used blocks remain in main memory and, additionally, the records within a block are renewed on a rolling basis. The operation of our algorithms rely on simple random choices, instead of utilizing cumbersome sorting data structures, which ensure that the probability of inactive blocks and older records to remain in main memory decays in order to free space for more promising blocks and fresher records, respectively.

We have extended our prior approach by introducing multidimensional probability density components to represent class density using an adaptive mixture of such components. The number of components in the adaptive mixture algorithm, as well as the values of the parameters of the density components, is estimated from the data. The network utilizes a recursive version of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to minimize the Kullback-Leibler information metric by means of stochastic approximation combined with a rule for creation of new components. Learning occurs incrementally in order to allow the system to take advantage of increasing amounts of data without having to take the system offline periodically to update models. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. In addition, the adaptive mixtures neural network classifies streaming track data as normal or deviant. These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives by enabling a shift of operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response.

With the spread of new technologies, e.g., big data, distributed data processing and machine learning open up new possibilities for surveillance systems. Commercial data providers provide trajectories of all kinds of vessels and aircraft worldwide. Best known are automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast and (satellite-) automatic identification system used in air and maritime surveillance. Both are cooperative systems and, meanwhile, also integrated as the sensor source in surveillance systems. An advantage of these trajectories is that in addition to the unique identification of the object by an identifier, e.g., International Civil Aviation Organization code or Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI), with which they can be easily assigned to the generating objects contain additional context data that can be used as labels for supervised machine learning. In addition, they are similar in structure to radar tracks and are, therefore, ideal for analysis and training of learning algorithms.

In this work, we propose a collaborative inference approach that uses both a smartwatch and a connected smartphone to maximize the performance of heart rate (HR) tracking while also maximizing the smartwatch's battery life. In particular, we first analyze the trade-offs between running on-device HR tracking or offloading the work to the mobile. Then, thanks to an additional step to evaluate the difficulty of the upcoming HR prediction, we demonstrate that we can smartly manage the workload between smartwatch and smartphone, maintaining a low mean absolute error (MAE) while reducing energy consumption. We benchmark our approach on a custom smartwatch prototype, including the STM32WB55 MCU and Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) communication, and a Raspberry Pi3 as a proxy for the smartphone. With our Collaborative Heart Rate Inference System (CHRIS), we obtain a set of Pareto-optimal configurations demonstrating the same MAE as State-of-Art (SoA) algorithms while consuming less energy. For instance, we can achieve approximately the same MAE of TimePPG-Small [1] (5.54 BPM MAE vs. 5.60 BPM MAE) while reducing the energy by 2.03×, with a configuration that offloads 80% of the predictions to the phone.

This system produces location data for each entity to track from several times per second to every few minutes, depending on how often it is desired to refresh the location data. The increase in the volume of data that is required to be collected, stored, processed, analyzed, and reported, is one of the reasons for the development of big data technologies. This paper aims to explain the transformation of data architecture according to the target short-term and long-term analytical needs of RTLS and to compare traditional architecture and big data architecture on read times and storage costs. In order to achieve that, the data in the relational database system is extracted to.csv files in its raw form with a microservice triggered daily within the relational database management system. Data is processed in Python language to meet the three different reporting requirements of RTLS. Analyzed data is stored in a column-family NoSQL database Apache Cassandra by modeling differently in line with the query parameters for faster query purposes. By not archiving the location data on the relational database, without affecting the performance health of RTLS, meaningful results are produced from this data and are reported on the application. As the size of the input and output data used for reporting increases, the need to use a NoSQL database is essential in terms of query response times. NoSQL database systems may require the same data to reside in multiple tables, so the storage cost per row is about 67% lower than SQL database, but as the number of queries to the data increases, storage costs can exceed SQL databases.",2770-7946,979-8-3503-0659-0,10.1109/ASYU58738.2023.10296768,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10296768,real-time location systems;big data architecture;location data;NoSQL database,Structured Query Language;Technological innovation;Costs;NoSQL databases;Relational databases;Big Data;Real-time systems,,,,11.0,IEEE,31 Oct 2023,11-13 Oct. 2023,11-13 Oct. 2023,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Big data platform provided scalable storage to manage enterprise data growth and served easier data access to decision-makers, stakeholders and business users. It is a well-known challenge to classify, organize and store all this data and process it to provide business insights. Due to nature, variety, velocity, volume and value of data make it difficult to effectively process big data. Enterprises face challenges to apply complex business rules, to generate insights and to support data-driven decisions in a timely fashion. As big data lake integrates streams of data from a bunch of business units, stakeholders usually analyze enterprise-wide data from various data models. Data models are a vital component of Big data platform. Users may do complex processing, run queries and perform big table joins to generate required metrics depending on the available data models. It is usually a time consuming and resource-intensive process to find the value from data.

This causes pressure on existing compute infrastructures and data analysis methods, as more and more data are considered as a useful source of information for making critical decisions in particular fields. Among these fields exist several areas related to human life, e.g., various branches of medicine, where the uncertainty of data complicates the data analysis, and where the inclusion of fuzzy expert knowledge in data processing brings many advantages. In this paper, we show how fuzzy techniques can be incorporated in big data analytics carried out with the declarative U-SQL language over a big data lake located on the cloud. We define the concept of big data lake together with the Extract, Process, and Store process performed while schematizing and processing data from the Data Lake, and while storing results of the processing. Our solution, developed as a Fuzzy Search Library for Data Lake, introduces the possibility of massively parallel, declarative querying of big data lake with simple and complex fuzzy search criteria, using fuzzy linguistic terms in various data transformations, and fuzzy grouping. Presented ideas are exemplified by a distributed analysis of large volumes of biomedical data on Microsoft Azure cloud. Results of performed tests confirm that the presented solution is highly scalable on the Cloud and is a successful step toward soft and declarative processing of data on a large scale.

This enormous amount of energy consumption at the university need a huge effort to reduce it. Smart grid is among the efficient solution to save energy and balance supply and demand. For the same purpose, the National School of Applied Sciences of El Jadida-Morocco wants take advantage from smart grid to maintain the balance between energy production and consumption. Despite of all added value of this smart grid solution for the school, it has the issue of managing energy production surplus, because it cannot inject it into Moroccan electrical infrastructure neither store it using storage devices. So, to overcome this challenge the system need to predict electrical consumption to be able to produce exactly the same value. Recently, Big Data contributed very well in analysing electrical consumption data using many tools and advanced techniques. It process, interprets and analyzes huge quantity of data to make it more profitable and valuable. For that reason, the school will take refuge in Big data technology to implement a custom system to predict electrical energy consumption by analyze all factors that influence electrical energy use. In this paper, we propose a benchmark of the main Big Data architectures in the field and that will cover all electrical energy data processing from data collection, data storage, data analytic and data visualization.

Enhancing Speed and Quality of Somatic Variant Calling via Big Data Architecture and Deep Learning Models,E. Abidi; Z. T. Ayoub; S.

Identifying these variants is pivotal. Somatic variant calling is a process used in genomics to detect DNA mutations by comparing the genetic data of normal (healthy) cells with that of potentially mutated cells, typically from a tumor, and it is essential for understanding cancer development, diagnosis, and tailoring therapies. Accurate identification is a critical step [3], especially after Next-generation sequencing technologies emerged, enabling the production of genome sequences at an unprecedented rate [4]. Variant calling pipelines streamline the process; nevertheless, it is not without challenges. One of the primary issues is handling the vast genomic data efficiently. Traditional large-scale computation is typically processor-bound, which is suitable for conventional applications. However, in the big data world, where vast amounts of data are generated, genomics in our case, disk latency becomes a significant bottleneck. To address this, a new framework based on distributed computing is necessary. This framework is designed to scale from single servers to multiple machines, collectively known as a cluster. The core idea is to distribute the data across a large cluster of machines and bring the program to the data. This approach ensures that the entire cluster is utilized for both reading and processing the data [5]. This ensures faster somatic mutation identification, which is vital as these variants can provide valuable insights into the exact type of cancer, its aggressiveness, and in turn, potential treatment options. Therefore, speeding up the detection process can lead to early diagnosis and earlier interventions that could substantially improve survival rates. Additionally, compared with germline variations, the detection of somatic variants in the cancer genome is complex due to tumor purity (proportion of tumor cells relative to normal cells in the tumor) and tumor heterogeneity (different tumor cells can have different mutations) [6]. So enhancing the accuracy of these calls minimizes the chances of false positives (incorrectly identifying a mutation) and false negatives (missing a mutation), ensuring that patients receive the correct treatment",2161-5330,979-8-3315-1824-0,10.1109/AICCSA63423.2024.10912614,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10912614,,Sequential analysis;Accuracy;Pipelines;Genomics;Production;Big Data;Servers;Bioinformatics;Tumors;Cancer,,,,10.0,IEEE,11 Mar 2025,22-26 Oct. 2024,22-26 Oct. 2024,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

One of the problems attached to traditional data lakes is the difficulty of retrieving data, which is slow to query, inefficiently, and with high complexities of schema evolution the ability of the data lake to optimize workloads dynamically. To overcome these problems, the work presented in this paper brings forward the concept of an AI-optimized data lake framework that exploits machine learning and deep learning for intelligent data ingestion, adaptive indexing as well as self-optimizing query execution. The system is proposed to incorporate hierarchical storage management with AI-driven, self-studying indexing mechanisms, and reinforcement learning-aided query optimization to improve data retrieval efficiency. Furthermore, through an integrated AI-powered anomaly detection system, data processing is made robust and reliable in real time. On top of that the framework also involves autonomous governance and security that can use explainable AI for compliance auditing and a dynamic role-based access control (RBAC). Experimental evaluations show that, with up to a 90% time saving, and with real-time decision-making capabilities, it improves over both aspects in a variety of data workloads.

Nevertheless, various types of sensors will produce an increasing volume of big data along with the implementation of a smart city, where we face redundant and diverse data. Therefore, providing satisfactory QoE will become the major challenge in the big-data-based smart city. In this article, to enhance the QoE, we propose a novel big data architecture consisting of three planes: the data storage plane, the data processing plane, and the data application plane. The data storage plane stores a wide variety of data collected by sensors and originating from different data sources. Then the data processing plane filters, analyzes, and processes the ocean of data to make decisions autonomously for extracting high-quality information. Finally, the application plane initiates the execution of the events corresponding to the decisions delivered from the data processing plane. Under this architecture, we particularly use machine learning techniques, trying to acquire accurate data and deliver precise information to end users.

This paper, using random matrix theory (RMT), motivates data-driven tools to perceive the complex grids in high-dimension; meanwhile, an architecture with detailed procedures is proposed. In algorithm perspective, the architecture performs a high-dimensional analysis and compares the findings with RMT predictions to conduct anomaly detections. Mean spectral radius (MSR), as a statistical indicator, is defined to reflect the correlations of system data in different dimensions. In management mode perspective, a group-work mode is discussed for smart grids operation. This mode breaks through regional limitations for energy flows and data flows, and makes advanced big data analyses possible. For a specific large-scale zone-dividing system with multiple connected utilities, each site, operating under the group-work mode, is able to work out the regional MSR only with its own measured/simulated data. The large-scale interconnected system, in this way, is naturally decoupled from statistical parameters perspective, rather than from engineering models perspective. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of these distributed MSRs, even with imperceptible different raw data, will produce a contour line to detect the event and locate the source. It demonstrates that the architecture is compatible with the block calculation only using the regional small database; beyond that, this architecture, as a data-driven solution, is sensitive to system situation awareness, and practical for real large-scale interconnected systems.

We envision a cloud-based eco-system in which high quality data from large numbers of independently-managed sensors is shared or even traded in real-time. Such an eco-system will necessarily have multiple stakeholders such as sensor data providers, domain applications that utilize sensor data (data consumers), and cloud infrastructure providers who may collaborate as well as compete. While there has been considerable research on wireless sensor networks, the challenges involved in building cloud-based platforms for hosting sensor services are largely unexplored. In this paper, we present our vision for data quality (DQ)-centric big data infrastructure for federated sensor service clouds. We first motivate our work by providing real-world examples. We outline the key features that federated sensor service clouds need to possess. This paper proposes a big data architecture in which DQ is pervasive throughout the platform. Our architecture includes a markup language called SDQ-ML for describing sensor services as well as for domain applications to express their sensor feed requirements.

To be able to generate good models, a lot of experimental data are required. Moreover, the high frequency sampling required for electronic devices implies that huge amounts of experimental data must be efficiently stored, transformed, and analyzed in the prediction models. The first contribution of this paper is the proposal of a Big Data architecture that can be used for a generic prognostics approach of electronic devices. To illustrate the proposal, the dataset for power MOSFET prognostics developed at the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence is used. This paper carefully illustrates the analysis, extraction, and transformation stages required to obtain the data for the estimation of the degradation models. An additional contribution of this paper is to study scalable methods to perform such estimation. Instead of using typical approaches such as extended Kalman filters, particle filters, or relevance vector machines to perform the estimation, we propose to use much simpler techniques (such as least squares or horizontal average) to allow a scalable implementation in a Big Data (distributed and parallelized) platform.

Furthermore, several opportunities of DX have been provided by the remarkable advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, there remains essential difficulties in applying AI to field business, which are caused by the lack of domain knowledge (DK) specific to the enterprise. Data catalog (DC) is data management software employed on data lakes, which is designed to facilitate the utilization of data assets. DC provides data analysts with the enterprise-specific DK to find appropriate data for their analysis. Thus, the DK retained in DC can be beneficial for enhancing AI technologies. Under these considerations, we utilized DC for enhancing AI technologies. By employing the enterprise-specific DK in DC, the performance of AI can be improved with respect to the affinity to the enterprise. We developed two use cases of utilizing DC for enhancing AI technologies.

In addition, considering that a sample is scanned at different angles a big set of projections is formed. Therefore, when using micro-resolution tomographic instruments, for a single soil sample it is necessary to deal with amounts of data in the order of gigabytes. On the other hand, the quantity of samples contributes to quality of information, for example, in the construction of maps to study agricultural soils. In general, in order to get improvements in the quality of soil analyzes it is required to increase exponentially the amount of the soil samples, i. e., increasing the amount of data to be reconstructed, which exceed the order of terabytes. This massive amount of data suggests new emerging methods and technologies. In this sense, Big Data has shown the great potential in optimizing data, making decisions, spotting business trends in various fields such agriculture. In this work, the infrastructure for the process of tomographic reconstruction of agricultural soil samples based on Big Data is presented. We introduced the Big Data architecture which uses the Hadoop framework. Additionally, we present the Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) algorithm adapted to the MapReduce model.

This paper describes a new, query model based approach, which uses a big data architecture to capture data from various sources using OPC UA as a foundation. It buffers and preprocesses the information for the purpose of harmonizing and providing a holistic state space of a factory, as well as mappings to the current state of a production site. That information can be made available to multiple processing sinks, decoupled from the data sources, which enables them to work with the information without interfering with devices of the production, disturbing the network devices they are working in, or influencing the production process negatively.

Checking of the streaming data once is not the solution as security breaches cannot be understood. The data stack up within the clouds is not the only preference as big data technology is available for dispensation of both structured and unstructured data.

But, if these encryption mechanisms are applied, then the performance of network system gets degraded. In order to resolve those issues, the proposed work is making using of compression mechanism to reduce the size before implementing encryption. Moreover, data is spitted in order to make the transmission more reliable. After splitting the data contents data has been transferred from multiple route. If some hackers opt to capture that data in unauthentic manner, then they would be unable to get complete and meaning full information.

To solve the problem, this paper proposes a big data analysis architecture for thermal power based on data processing flow. According to this architecture, a big data mining method for operation parameters optimization based on parallel association rules is presented. Firstly, a new distributed adaptive K-means algorithm is proposed to realize the classification of working conditions based on external constraints, which can improve the computing efficiency and avoid the defect of determining the division number artificially. Then, Spark-based FP-growth algorithm is applied to mine the strong association rules under various working conditions, thus the optimization target values of operation parameters can be obtained by the best strong association rules. Lastly, the excavated optimization target values constitute the historical knowledge database to optimize the real-time operating parameters. The experiment results show that the proposed method in this paper is effective, and can improve the accuracy of operation parameters optimization.",,978-1-7281-1454-5,10.1109/DDCLS.2019.8908932,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8908932,Big data of thermal power;Big data architecture;Parallel association rule;Parameter optimization,Coal;Employee welfare;Optimization,,,,20.0,IEEE,25 Nov 2019,24-27 May 2019,24-27 May 2019,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Still Open Problems in Data Warehouse and Data Lake Research,,,"2020 Seventh International Conference on Social Networks Analysis, Management and Security (SNAMS)",3 Feb 2021,2020,,,1,1,"Summary form only given. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The traditional DW architecture and technologies for some years have been evolving towards handling big data. It has been agreed that the industry to-be standard that allow to integrate big data is a data lake (DL) architecture. A data lake is a repository that stores a vast amount of heterogeneous data in their original formats. Typically, it includes unstructured data from external data sources. It may also stage together internal company DSs (i.e., well-structured, of very high quality) and external DSs (i.e., unstructured, of very low quality). Such staged DSs are then integrated (by ETL processes, a.k.a. data processing workflows - DPW or data processing pipelines - DPP) in another repository in structured way - this repository is a counterpart of a DW. DL architectures are more and more frequently being developed in cloud eco-systems, e.g., Azure, GCP, or AWS. Despite the fact that the DW technologies have been developed for at most 30 years by multiple research communities and IT industry (resulting in mature and advanced technologies and methods), there still exist research problems to be solved. Big data make the (already difficult) problems even more difficult and add new challenges. The following ones will be highlighted in this talk; · handling the impact of the evolution of data source structures on an integration layer, · optimizing executions of data processing workflows, · cataloging available data sets and metadata management, · assuring high quality of data (especially duplicate elimination) in a DW and DL.

In this work we propose a “Fast Data” architecture for a specific kind of software application in which input data arrive very fast and the results for each processed data have to match such input rates. We applied this architecture to build a Dashboard for Anomalous Traffic Analysis in Data Networks. In order to fulfill the requirements of Real-Time processing and no data losses, we carry out a design that consists of a pattern of dynamic tree of process pipelines, where the number of branches increases proportionally to the input data rate. Two different approaches have been followed to implement this design pattern: one based in a well-known set of products from the Big Data ecosystem; and the other built with Kafka, Zookeeper and a set of components designed and implemented by us. These two implementations have been compared in terms of velocity and scalability performance. As a result, the implementation built with our own components is significantly faster and scalable than the traditional one.

The modern data stack introduces flexibility and tool diversity, while cloud-native platforms redefine scalability and simplify integration. Yet, selecting the appropriate stack remains a complex task, as most prior research focuses on isolated components rather than holistic, practical comparisons. This paper addresses that gap by evaluating three prevalent data architecture paradigms: Hadoop, Modern, and Cloud-Based stacks.

Moreover, beyond architectural assessment, we implement each stack on a real-world scenario using the Amazon Books Reviews dataset where each implementation is evaluated based on key metrics such as scalability, performance, ease, and deployment costs.

Knowledge cubes — A proposal for scalable and semantically-guided management of Big Data,A. Madkour; W. G. Aref; S. Basalamah,"Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA; Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA; Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, KSA",2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data,23 Dec 2013,2013,,,1,7,"A Knowledge Cube, or cube for short, is an intelligent and adaptive database instance capable of storing, analyzing, and searching data. Each cube is established based on semantic aspects, e.g., (1) Topical, (2) Contextual, (3) Spatial, or (4) Temporal. A cube specializes in handling data that is only relevant to the cube's semantics. Knowledge cubes are inspired by two prime architectures: (1) Dataspaces that provides an abstraction for data management where heterogeneous data sources can co-exist and it requires no prespecified unifying schema, and (2) Linked Data that provides best practices for publishing and interlinking structured data on the web. A knowledge cube uses Linked Data as its main building block for its data layer and encompasses some of the data integration abstractions defined by Dataspaces. In this paper, knowledge cubes are proposed as a semantically-guided data management architecture, where data management is influenced by the data semantics rather than by a predefined scheme. Knowledge cubes support the five pillars of Big Data also known as the five V's, namely Volume, Velocity, Veracity, Variety, and Value. Interesting opportunities can be leveraged when learning the semantics of the data. This paper highlights these opportunities and proposes a strawman design for knowledge cubes along with the research challenges that arise when realizing them.",,978-1-4799-1293-3,10.1109/BigData.2013.6691800,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691800,big data architecture;semantics;data management,Semantics;Information management;Data handling;Data storage systems;Resource description framework;Indexes;Catalogs,,9.0,,26.0,IEEE,23 Dec 2013,6-9 Oct. 2013,6-9 Oct. 2013,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Such massive and diverse datasets exceed the limits of traditional schema-based methods as well as rigid rule-based systems. This research develops an AI-based method for intelligent classification and automated metadata extraction through Large Language Models. The system uses pre-trained LLMs' contextual understanding and transfer learning abilities to accurately extract metadata from documents logs and multimedia items which have semi-structured and unstructured formats. The framework incorporates a zero-shot learning method from LLMs which teams up with supervised fine-tuning for domainspecific tagging. The validated architecture shows better performance and adaptivity through achieving superior accuracy than traditional NLP-based metadata engines when applied to real-world lakehouse dataset storage. Experimental findings demonstrate that LLMs create substantial enhancements in metadata development as well as search functions and data protection metrics in modern big data systems.

The fundamental principle behind these systems is the separation of compute and storage layers. In this architecture, inexpensive cloud storage is utilized for data storage, while compute engines are employed to perform analytics on this data in an “on-demand” mode. However, to execute any calculations on the data, it must be transferred from the storage layer to the compute layer over the network for each query. This transfer can negatively impact calculation performance and requires significant network bandwidth. In our work, we examine various strategies to enhance query performance within a cloud data lake architecture. We begin by formalizing the problem and proposing a straightforward yet robust theoretical framework that clearly outlines the associated trade-offs. Central to our framework is the concept of a “query coverage set,” which is defined as the collection of files that need to be accessed from storage to fulfill a specific query. Our objective is to identify the minimal coverage set for each query and execute the query exclusively on this subset of files.

The digital revolution has transformed the manufacturing industry into smart manufacturing through the development of intelligent systems. In this paper, a big data ecosystem is presented for the implementation of fault detection and diagnosis in predictive maintenance with real industrial big data gathered directly from large-scale global manufacturing plants, aiming to provide a complete architecture which could be used in industrial IoT-based smart manufacturing in an industrial 4.0 system. The proposed architecture overcomes multiple challenges including big data ingestion, integration, transformation, storage, analytics, and visualization in a real-time environment using various technologies such as the data lake, NoSQL database, Apache Spark, Apache Drill, Apache Hive, OPC Collector, and other techniques. Transformation protocols, authentication, and data encryption methods are also utilized to address data and network security issues. A MapReduce-based distributed PCA model is designed for fault detection and diagnosis. In a large-scale manufacturing system, not all kinds of failure data are accessible, and the absence of labels precludes all the supervised methods in the predictive phase. Furthermore, the proposed framework takes advantage of some of the characteristics of PCA such as its ease of implementation on Spark, its simple algorithmic structure, and its real-time processing ability. All these elements are essential for smart manufacturing in the evolution to Industry 4.0. The proposed detection system has been implemented into the real-time industrial production system in a cooperated company, running for several years, and the results successfully provide an alarm warning several days before the fault happens.

By using the big data technologies that enable efficient data processing, the value of the data increases, as these technologies can turn the data into actionable information that influences important decision-making processes. However, a broader view of the operational environment, an investigated phenomena, and challenges related to them can frequently be obtained after combining data from many data sets located in various big data lakes. This requires contact points in both data lakes that must be flexibly joined because in many cases, data sets do not correspond to one another directly. In this paper, we show fuzzy join operation for flexible combining big data lakes. The fuzzy join transforms numerical values of common attributes of joined data sets into fuzzy sets and uses such a representation in the join operation. We propose two variants of the join operation that transforms crisp numerical values of joining attributes into: 1) fuzzy numbers and 2) linguistic terms. The fuzzy join operation is implemented and tested in the declarative U-SQL language that is used for scalable and parallel querying in big data lakes. The ideas presented here are exemplified by a distributed analysis of cardiac disease data on Microsoft Azure cloud. The results of the conducted experiments confirm that the fuzzy join can enrich data sets that are used in making critical decisions and, as a highly scalable cloud-based solution, can be successfully used in processing large volumes of data delivered by cyber-physical systems.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879829,"Microsoft Research; Habilitation Grant of the Rector of the Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland(grant numbers:02/020/RGH18/0148); Statutory Research Funds of Institute of Informatics, Silesian University of Technology(grant numbers:BK/213/RAU2/2018); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8525267,Cyber-physical systems;big data;fuzzy logic;querying;cloud computing;biomedical data analysis;declarative languages,Lakes;Big Data;Cyber-physical systems;Cloud computing;Sensors;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring,,17.0,,51.0,CCBY,6 Nov 2018,2018,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Storage patterns have changed drastically with regard to data processing. The chapter explains storage patterns: data lakes, data warehouses, and data marts. The data lake can contain structured, semi‐structured, and unstructured data both from internal and external resources. The data warehouses have been widely adopted by the industry for business intelligence and analytics. An on‐premise platform can cost much less than a cloud‐based solution over the long term. Hadoop distributed file system and Hadoop ecosystem would be the choice for on‐premise big data platform.

A Hybrid ETL Framework for Optimized Data Ingestion and Real-Time Processing in Data Lakehouse Architectures using AI-Driven Orchestration and Contextual Data Partitioning,K. Abirami; S. Punitha,"Department of Computer and Information Science, Annamalai University, Chidambaram; Department of Computer Science, D.G.Govt.Arts College for Women, Mayiladuthurai","2025 7th International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)",24 Jun 2025,2025,,,1014,1020,"The need for effective Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) technologies that can manage the growing volumes of both structured and unstructured data in information lakehouse architectures is increasing due to the rapid expansion of data environments. Existing ETL systems struggle with performance, scalability, and adaptability, making it difficult to handle the rising demands of both batch and real-time data processing. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Hybrid ETL Infrastructure that combines contextual data partitioning with AI-driven orchestration to optimize data ingestion and real-time analysis in information lakehouses. The system addresses key issues, such as inefficient data handling, slow processing times, and inadequate transformation methods, by dynamically adjusting the ETL pipeline based on user requests, context-aware partitioning, and data characteristics. The AI-driven orchestration ensures efficient job scheduling by seamlessly switching between batch and real-time processing based on data importance, thereby improving both performance and flexibility. Contextual partitioning reduces processing costs and enhances query performance by automatically organizing data according to domain-specific knowledge and query intent. The primary goal of this framework is to improve data transformation and loading performance in information lakehouses, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making. Preliminary results show a 30% reduction in ETL processing time and significant improvements in query efficiency and accuracy, particularly in complex, cross-domain data retrieval environments.

However, existing detection methods face challenges in underground scenarios due to high noise, feature degradation, and the vast volume of data, resulting in insufficient accuracy and poor real-time performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes MinePCDet, a big data-based framework for underground point cloud object detection. The framework first constructs a comprehensive point cloud dataset encompassing various personnel behavioral postures and typical traffic scenarios in underground mining environments. Subsequently, a real-time adaptive object detection algorithm, SA-DBSCAN, is introduced to enhance detection accuracy and robustness in complex underground settings. Finally, a big data architecture integrating Apache Kafka is designed to enable real-time processing, multi-device scalability, historical data analysis, and anomaly tracing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high detection accuracy while maintaining real-time performance and scalability, highlighting the potential of big data technologies in addressing intelligent perception applications in underground mining.",2573-301X,979-8-3315-7966-1,10.1109/CBD69312.2025.00033,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11366760,object detection;big data;smart mining,Point cloud compression;Degradation;Accuracy;Scalability;Object detection;Big Data;Real-time systems;Robustness;Data mining;Personnel,,,,14.0,IEEE,4 Feb 2026,29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2025,29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2025,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Thus, noisy label detection is an important research topic. Previous efforts mainly focus on noisy label detection on specific datasets that have been collected. Some works select clean samples based on relations between representations during the training process; some works utilize confidence outputs of a pre-trained model for noisy label detection. However, how to perform efficient and fine-grained noisy label detection on constantly arriving datasets in a data lake with a large amount of inventory data has not been explored. The rapidly growing volume and changing distribution of data make conventional methods either incur large computation overhead due to repeated training or become increasingly ineffective on newly arriving data. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a novel approach ENLD to perform efficient and accurate noisy label detection on incremental datasets.

SemanticPrefetcher: Accelerate Data Lake Access with Semantics-Aware File Prefetching,T. Wang; G. Wang; M. Yang; M. Luo; M. Zou; C. Chen; M.

Under these conditions, traditional sequential, correlation-based, and semantic prefetching methods become ineffective, leading to cache inefficiency and high latency. We propose SemanticPrefetcher, a lightweight, semantic-aware prefetching mechanism that incrementally constructs meaningful access streams at runtime. The system operates in three stages: it tokenizes file paths or object names into a unified semantic representation, clusters related requests into coherent streams despite multi-tenant interleaving, and detects naming regularities to predict future accesses. This design transforms mixed and seemingly disordered requests into predictable access flows without application modifications. Implemented on JuiceFS, SemanticPrefetcher reduces end-to-end execution time by up to 39.6% and read latency by 79.3% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that implicit semantics in file paths can be effectively leveraged for robust and efficient prefetching in cloud-scale data lakes.",2380-8004,979-8-3315-6634-0,10.1109/CloudCom67567.2025.11331481,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11331481,Cloud computing;Data lake;Storage-compute disaggregation;Semantic analysis;Prefetching,Computers;Cloud computing;Runtime;Prefetching;Semantics;Transforms;Big Data applications,,,,28.0,IEEE,20 Jan 2026,14-16 Nov. 2025,14-16 Nov. 2025,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Manipulating Data Lakes Intelligently With Java Annotations,L. M. Hoi; W. Ke; S. K. Im,"Faculty of Applied Sciences, Macao Polytechnic University, Macau, China; Faculty of Applied Sciences, Macao Polytechnic University, Macau, China; Faculty of Applied Sciences, Macao Polytechnic University, Macau, China",IEEE Access,8 Mar 2024,2024,12,,34903,34917,"Data lakes are typically large data repositories where enterprises store data in a variety of data formats. From the perspective of data storage, data can be categorized into structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. On the one hand, due to the complexity of data forms and transformation procedures, many enterprises simply pour valuable data into data lakes without organizing and managing them effectively. This can create data silos (or data islands) or even data swamps, with the result that some data will be permanently invisible. Although data are integrated into a data lake, they are simply physically stored in the same environment and cannot be correlated with other data to leverage their precious value. On the other hand, processing data from a data lake into a desired format is always a difficult and tedious task that requires experienced programming skills, such as conversion from structured to semi-structured. In this article, a novel software framework called Java Annotation for Manipulating Data Lakes (JAMDL) that can manage heterogeneous data is proposed. This approach uses Java annotations to express the properties of data in metadata (data about data) so that the data can be converted into different formats and managed efficiently in a data lake. Furthermore, this article suggests using artificial intelligence (AI) translation models to generate Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations for data manipulation and uses AI recommendation models to improve the visibility of data when data precipitation occurs.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3372618,Macao Polytechnic University(grant numbers:RP/ESCA-03/2020); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10458132,Data lake;data precipitation;data stewards;enterprise-level applications;impedance mismatch;java annotations;JAMDL;object-oriented;ORMapping;software framework,Big Data applications;Java;Annotations;Databases;Software engineering;Artificial intelligence;Structured Query Language;Data lakes;Enterprise resource planning;Object oriented databases,,1.0,,42.0,CCBYNCND,1 Mar 2024,2024,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Specifically, we introduce a stream (storage) object as a storage abstraction for message streaming data to achieve the storage-disaggregated architecture with high scalability and reliability. Moreover, we utilize the erasure coding and tiered storage to save the storage cost, and furthermore, the stream object can be automatically converted to a table object such that cost-effective stream and batch data processing can be achieved. For tabular data, we implement the lakehouse functionality to support ACID via the table object, with a metadata acceleration to improve the efficiency of data access between the compute and storage engines. Also, we design a LakeBrain optimizer at the storage side to optimize the query performance and resource utilization under the storage-disaggregated architecture. Finally, we have also deployed StreamLake in China Mobile, the world's largest mobile network operator to serve over 20PB production data, and the results demonstrate improvements of 30% to 4x in terms of query performance and over 37% in terms of cost saving.",2375-026X,979-8-3503-1715-2,10.1109/ICDE60146.2024.00386,"NSFC(grant numbers:62102215,U23B2019,61925205,62232009,U23A20297,61932004,62225203,U21A20516,U2001211); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB4503600,2022YFB2702100); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10598130,,Costs;Scalability;Computer architecture;Production;Data processing;Big Data applications;Reliability engineering,,3.0,,47.0,IEEE,23 Jul 2024,13-16 May 2024,13-16 May 2024,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Users collectively create a voluminous and multi-lingual corpus in a very broad range of topics on a daily basis. The discourse generated in the blogosphere is often of prime interest and importance to individuals, organizations, and companies. These actors would certainly like to periodically receive an overall assessment of demonstrated ""sentiments"" on specific issues by automatically classifying tweets expressed in different languages in conjunction with big-data analytics. In this paper, we propose a scalable service platform that employs multilingual sentiment analysis to classify streamed-tweets and yields analytics for selected topics in real-time. We discuss the main component of our Spark-enabled platform as we seek to offer an effective big-data service that can: 1) dynamically handle voluminous as well as high-rate tweettraffic through a multi-component application exploiting the latest software developments, 2) accurately identify messages originated by non-genuine user-accounts, and 3) utilize the Spark machine-learning library (MLib) to successfully classify streamed multi-lingual messages in real-time, using multiple potentially distributed executors.

However, the increasing types of sensors and devices are producing an explosion of big data. Extracting valuable contents for caching is becoming a vital issue for the satisfaction of QoE. Therefore, it is urgent to propose some rational strategies to improve QoE, which is the major challenge for content-centric caching. This article introduces a novel big data architecture consisting of data management units for content extraction and caching decision, improving quality of service and ensuring QoE. Then a caching strategy is proposed to improve QoE, including three parts: (1) the caching location decision, which means the method of deploying caching nodes to make them closer to users; (2) caching capacity assessment, which aims to seek suitable contents to match the capacity of caching nodes; and (3) caching priority choice, which leads to contents being cached according to their priority to meet user demands. With this architecture and strategy, we particularly use a caching algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to achieve lower cost for intelligent caching.

It requires rapid integration of new information on a continuous basis for subsequent analyses. ETL-based and traditionally batch-processing oriented methods of absorbing changes into a relational database schema take time, and are therefore incompatible with very low-latency demands of realtime analytics. Instead, in-memory clustered stores that employ tunable consistency mechanisms are becoming attractive since they dispense with the need to transform and transit data between storage layouts and tiers. When data is updated infrequently, in-memory approaches such as RDD transformations in Spark can suffice, but as updates become frequent, such in-memory approaches need to be extended to support dynamic datasets.

Multimodal data queries are crucial because they enable seamless retrieval of related data across modalities, such as tables, images, and text, which has applications in fields like e-commerce, healthcare, and education. However, existing methods primarily focus on single-modality queries, such as joinable or unionable table discovery, and struggle to handle the heterogeneity and lack of metadata in data lakes while balancing accuracy and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multimodal data Query mechanism for Data Lakes (MQDL), which employs a modality-adaptive indexing mechanism raleted and contrastive learning based embeddings to unify representations across modalities. Additionally, we introduce product quantization to optimize candidate verification during queries, reducing computational overhead while maintaining precision. We evaluate MQDL using a table-image dataset across multiple business scenarios, measuring metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Results show that MQDL achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 90%, while demonstrating strong scalability and reduced query response time compared to traditional methods. These findings highlight MQDL's potential to enhance multimodal data retrieval in complex data lake environments.",1007-0214,,10.26599/TST.2025.9010022,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11072065,multimodal data query;data lake;contrastive learning;related data query,Quantization (signal);Accuracy;Scalability;Contrastive learning;Medical services;Metadata;Data retrieval;Big Data applications;Time factors;Indexing,,1.0,,36.0,,4 Jul 2025,December 2025,,TUP,TUP Journals

However, the complexity, diversity, frequently changed workloads, and rapid evolution of big data systems raise great challenges in big data benchmarking. Considering the broad use of big data systems, for the sake of fairness, big data benchmarks must include diversity of data and workloads, which is the prerequisite for evaluating big data systems and architecture. Most of the state-of-the-art big data benchmarking efforts target evaluating specific types of applications or system software stacks, and hence they are not qualified for serving the purposes mentioned above. This paper presents our joint research efforts on this issue with several industrial partners. Our big data benchmark suite-BigDataBench not only covers broad application scenarios, but also includes diverse and representative data sets. Currently, we choose 19 big data benchmarks from dimensions of application scenarios, operations/ algorithms, data types, data sources, software stacks, and application types, and they are comprehensive for fairly measuring and evaluating big data systems and architecture.

Also, we comprehensively characterize 19 big data workloads included in BigDataBench with varying data inputs. On a typical state-of-practice processor, Intel Xeon E5645, we have the following observations: First, in comparison with the traditional benchmarks: including PARSEC, HPCC, and SPECCPU, big data applications have very low operation intensity, which measures the ratio of the total number of instructions divided by the total byte number of memory accesses; Second, the volume of data input has non-negligible impact on micro-architecture characteristics, which may impose challenges for simulation-based big data architecture research; Last but not least, corroborating the observations in CloudSuite and DCBench (which use smaller data inputs), we find that the numbers of L1 instruction cache (L1I) misses per 1000 instructions (in short, MPKI) of the big data applications are higher than in the traditional benchmarks; also, we find that L3 caches are effective for the big data applications, corroborating the observation in DCBench.",2378-203X,978-1-4799-3097-5,10.1109/HPCA.2014.6835958,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835958,,Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Social network services;System software;Search engines,,404.0,1.0,31.0,IEEE,19 Jun 2014,15-19 Feb. 2014,15-19 Feb. 2014,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

To address this issue, the paper presents a design and implementation of a coffee commodity trading big data warehouse capable of analyzing various essential parameters for supporting informed decision-making. First, the designed system can automatically collect coffee trading data for New York Arabica coffee futures prices from selected worldwide reports and financial data portals. Next, the Extract, transform, and load (ETL) process is adopted to ingest coffee futures trading crawled data into the 3 layers data warehouse. Finally, the analytical system will extract and visualize selected key dimensions that influence coffee futures prices within different observation windows and perspectives.

Data lake (DL), as a flexible on-demand heterogeneous data management architecture, has become a feasible solution in data management. Metadata modeling for DLs is the key basis for smart analysis and processing. However, the varieties in structures and semantics of industrial WoT data hinder metadata modeling and maintenance. Moreover, the lack of textual descriptions and the semantics hidden in value streams make it hard to automatically construct semantic metadata. The dynamic nature of WoT requires on-time evolution on metadata. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated bottom-up metadata generation approach for DL of WoT applications. Applying a data-driven framework, raw data are notated as linked data and self-organizing map-based online clustering is applied to real timely extract data characteristics. To recognize entities, concepts and relations, semantics-based entity discovery approach from short texts is proposed according to the feature of WoT data.

We present Triage-Bot, an online medical triage provisioning service, that can revolutionize emergency care by decreasing the load on emergency departments (ED), reducing healthcare expenses, and improving the quality of care. Empowered by artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the Triage-Bot service assesses and prioritizes patients' needs based on symptoms, medical history, and perceived conditions from multimodal video, audio, and text data captured during patients' interactions. The captured summarized information with a severity ranking is sent to a human expert to suggest the next action on the user's part. The diverse data types used by the Triage-Bot in communication, authentication, data collection, storage, and analytics requires a robust and scalable system architecture for online service provisioning.

Connected vehicle trajectory data now enables a scalable, complementary “top-down” approach for system-wide performance analysis, even for locations with no detection or communication. This paper proposes a data architecture for derived performance measures that can be used for both strategic (top-down) and tactical (bottom-up) management of traffic signals. To leverage a “top-down” approach, large amounts of data must be processed into smaller datasets. For efficiency and interoperability between performance measures and the tools used to derive the same, a scalable data management architecture is essential.

This framework collects data using a combination of a fixed time period, date, movement, approach, and intersection identifier. The structured model of derived performance measures supports both tactical applications, such as green-time allocation, and top-down, strategic management applications such as identifying capacity-constrained signals that are candidates for capital improvements.

A Vision for Data Alignment and Integration in Data Lakes,,,2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),26 Jan 2023,2022,,,2,2,"Summary form only. The requirements for integration over massive, heterogeneous table repositories (aka data lakes) are fundamentally different than they are for federated data integration (where the data owned by an enterprise is integrated into a cohesive whole) or data exchange (where data is exchanged and shared among a small set of autonomous peers). In this talk, I will outline a vision for data alignment and integration in data lakes. Data lakes afford new opportunities for using new methods, from network science and other areas, to discover emergent semantics from large heterogeneous collections of data sets.

Aggregating financial services data without assumptions: A semantic data reference architecture,S. Gollapudi,"Vice President Technology, Broadridge Financial Solutions (India) Pvt. Ltd, Hyderabad, India",Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 9th International Conference on Semantic Computing (IEEE ICSC 2015),2 Mar 2015,2015,,,312,315,"We are seeing a sea change down the pike in terms of financial information aggregation and consumption; this could potentially be a game changer in financial services space with focus on ability to commoditize data. Financial Services Industry deals with a tremendous amount of data that varies in its structure, volume and purpose. The data is generated in the ecosystem (its customers, its own accounts, partner trades, securities transactions etc.), is handled by many systems - each having its own perspective. Front-office systems handle transactional behavior of the data, middle office systems which typically work with a drop-copy of the data subject it to intense processing, business logic, computations (such as inventory positions, fee calculations, commissions) and the back office systems deal with reconciliation, cleansing, exception management etc. Then there are the analytic systems which are concerned with auditing, compliance reporting as well as business analytics. Data that flows through this ecosystem gets aggregated, transformed, and transported time and again. Traditional approaches to managing such data leverage Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) technologies to set up data marts where each data mart serves a specific purpose (such as reconciliation or analytics). The result is proliferation of transformations and marts in the Organization. The need is to have architectures and IT systems that can aggregate data from many such sources without making any assumptions on HOW, WHERE or WHEN this data will be used. The incoming data is semantically annotated and stored in the triple store within storage tier and offers the ability to store, query and draw inferences using the ontology. There is a probable need for a Big Data Solution here that helps ease data liberation and co-location. This paper is a summary of one such business case of the Financial Services Industry where traditional ETL silos was broken to support the structurally dynamic, ever expanding and changing data usage needs employing Ontology and Semantic techniques like RDF/RDFS, SPARQL, OWL and related stack.",,978-1-4799-7935-6,10.1109/ICOSC.2015.7050825,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050825,Financial Reference Data Management;Semantic Meta-data;Business Data Lake Reference Architecture;Semantics and Big Data;Layered Databases,Resource description framework;Security;Semantics;Databases;Communities;Lakes;Visualization,,7.0,,6.0,IEEE,2 Mar 2015,7-9 Feb. 2015,7-9 Feb. 2015,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Discovery and Matching Numerical Attributes in Data Lakes,P. Sukprasert; G. Y. -Y. Chan; R. A. Rossi; F. Du; E. Koh,Northwestern University; Adobe Research; Adobe Research; Databricks; Adobe Research,2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData),22 Jan 2024,2023,,,423,432,"In data platforms with thousands of data tables available for exploration, users often need to retrieve some data based on limited knowledge of the data sources and schema. The task that automates retrieving attributes from an online data lake given a set of entities from users is called “entity augmentation”. The key for successful entity augmentation is an accurate construction of semantic relationships between data tables. Current techniques either focus on retrieving categorical values or numerical values with pre-defined rules. Further, they assume there are meta-data available for each table, such as texts and tags. In this paper, we introduce a semantic graph for numerical data augmentation that (i) matches columns with similar semantic relationships without any meta-data from the tables; (ii) infer the conversion rules among different numerical columns based on the values. The approach is designed to be highly scalable and parallel for large-scale data lakes with millions of large datasets. We also propose efficient algorithms to construct the semantic graph on a distributed computing environment (i.e. Spark) and conduct numerical data augmentation using the graph. Through comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets, the approach is shown to (1) achieve better accuracy on semantic matches and value conversions and (2) scales to the tractable computation time on large-scale data.

Power grids around the world have upgraded to smart grid (SG) by introducing advanced monitoring technologies such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), smart meters and Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), which collect high-resolution electrical measurements across the system. This has brought in a massive amount of data, termed big data, that needs to be efficiently processed to derive valuable insights. Specifically, technical sophistication, security, and integration of datasets are the main concerns that need to be tackled to transform the massive dataset into useful insights. This chapter surveys big data analytics (BDA) and its related benefits, challenges, and advancements in SG’s perspective. BDA in combination with visualization tools, help in the predictive decision-making process in the SG. Thus, data analytics play a significant part in the efficient monitoring of the SG. Powered with the integration of information and communication technologies, an information layer has been introduced to the traditional power systems to collect, store, and process data from smart meters and sensor implementations. Big data architecture involves data aggregation, storing, and analytics, which integrates the SG’s need for a range of frameworks with outstanding computational skills to respond to the customer’s needs. Characterization of big data, SGs, and massive volumes of data processing is first addressed as a preface to demonstrate the motivation and possible benefits of integrating advanced data mining in smart grids. Specific principles and standard data analytics techniques for general concerns are also discussed. The chapter’s key section discusses the advanced uses of various data analytics in SG, leveraging machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). SG is benefited from the inherent capacity of ML to generalize, delivering reliable and quick power flow predictions from dispersed measurement units, with superior computing performance and interoperability.

Often each of these three goals are implemented independently and in various layers of the Big Data stack. For example, Big data query engines may add custom support for access control at the engine level but the underlying stored data is not necessarily secured. In the modern Data Lakehouse, there is open access to the underlying data in many companies’ data lakes and therefore it is not sufficient to implement security and compliance at an engine level.In this paper we present a unified way to address all three security goals at once through the shared lower layer of Apache Parquet which ensures these controls are enforced by higher level Big Data tools. We introduce performant file format level encryption with both column level and cell level granularity controlled by schema tagging. We achieve less than 8% write and less than 5% read performance overhead in most common scenarios of file format encryption by minimizing RPC calls required to perform encryption / decryption, leveraging AESNI and choosing optimal encryption options.

Seaports are the most critical point in the maritime logistics chain because of its multimodal and complex nature. Consequently, coordinated communication among any seaport stakeholders is vital to improving their operations. Currently, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Port Community Systems (PCS), as primary enablers of digital seaports, have demonstrated their limitations to interchange information on time, accurately, efficiently, and securely, causing high operation costs, low resource management, and low performance. For these reasons, this contribution presents the Seaport Data Space (SDS) based on the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture model to enable a secure data sharing space and promote an intelligent transport multimodal terminal. Each seaport stakeholders implements the IDS connector to take part in the SDS and share their data. On top of SDS, a Big Data architecture is integrated to manage the massive data shared in the SDS and extract useful information to improve the decision-making. The architecture has been evaluated by enabling a port authority and a container terminal to share its data with a shipping company. As a result, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed by using the Big Data architecture functionalities.

Focusing on the problems of slow model training speed and low forecasting accuracy due to the redundancy of training data samples and insufficient long periodic capture of data in complex weather, this paper proposes a two-stage method for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting based on data-driven. In the meteorological analysis stage, the generation power samples similar to the forecast day were extracted by inputting daily meteorological features and using maximal information coefficient (MIC) weighted grey correlation degree to form the corresponding forecast data set. In the power forecasting stage, the temporal convolutional used network (TCN) extracts local features to maintain the sequence of extracted features. Then the bidirectional gating unit (BiGRU) combined with the Skip connection strategy was used to fully learn the long and the short time sequence of photovoltaic sequences, and the attention mechanism was used to pay adaptive attention to the more important historical states. This study experimented on the measured data from a photovoltaic power station in Southeastern China. The experimental results show that this method is effective in photovoltaic power short-term forecasts. In addition, compared with the latest model, this method has smaller forecasting errors and higher robustness in the time scales of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and 60 minutes.

Sensors, edge devices, scientific applications and detectors generate huge amounts of data that are distributed for their nature. In order to extract value from such data requires a typical pipeline made of two main steps: first, the processing and then the data access. One of the main features for data access is fast response time, whose order of magnitude can vary a lot depending on the specific type of processing as well as processing patterns. The optimization of the access layer becomes more and more important while dealing with a geographically distributed environment where data must be retrieved from remote servers of a data lake. From the infrastructural perspectives, caching systems are used to mitigate latency and to serve better popular data. Thus, the role of the cache becomes a key to have an effective and efficient data access. In this article, we propose a Reinforcement Learning approach, using the Q-Learning technique, to improve the performances of a cache system in terms of data management. The proposed method uses two agents with different objectives and actions to control the addition and the eviction of files in the cache.

This information is considered as a valuable asset that, if properly analyzed, can help to make more informed decisions. However, since the analyses to be performed are often not known in advance, these data are stored in a raw format. This means that any application built on top of a data lake must carefully elicit what data will be used for a particular analysis and how those data will be transformed to make them all fit together into a dataset. This data selection and preparation task is typically performed by data scientists that write large and complicated scripts in data management languages to extract and transform the required data. This reduces the productivity of data scientists, who must write large pieces of highly similar code. It also makes it difficult for domain experts to participate in this process because they have little understanding of these scripts. To alleviate this problem, this work introduces a work-in-progress version of a high-level declarative language for specifying the requirements that a dataset coming from a data lake must satisfy.

Achieving this evolution is a task full of challenges. One of these challenges is the interoperability of the stakeholders' information systems. Interoperability has been widely studied but there is still some reluctance to adopt the solutions because the stakeholders are afraid of sharing their data. Recently, the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture proposes several recommendations and specifications to solve this issue based on data sovereignty concept. This architecture has not been studied nor implemented for the seaport use case yet. For this reason, this paper presents a seaport data space based on IDS architecture to share information in a secure and interoperable manner. Along with this, a big data architecture is added to exploit the shared data. The seaport data space is implemented using the FIWARE IoT platform. The seaport data space is tested by sharing the data of the port authority to the port terminal and analyzing the large shared data through descriptive analysis. The results show that by using the seaport data space, the shared data allow improving the decision making in the planning operations of the seaport.",,978-1-5386-4980-0,10.1109/WF-IoT.2019.8767216,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8767216,Interoperability;IDS;Industry;Big Data;seaport;Internet of Things,Seaports;Big Data;Connectors;Security;Stakeholders;Interoperability,,23.0,,16.0,IEEE,22 Jul 2019,15-18 April 2019,15-18 April 2019,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this challenging environment it is critical for telcos to maintain or grow their market share, by providing users with as good an experience as possible on their network. But the task of extracting customer insights from the vast amounts of data collected by telcos is growing in complexity and scale everey day. How can we measure and predict the quality of a user's experience on a telco network in real-time? That is the problem that we address in this paper. We present an approach to capture, in (near) real-time, the mobile customer experience in order to assess which conditions lead the user to place a call to a telco's customer care center. To this end, we follow a supervised learning approach for prediction and train our Restricted Random Forest model using, as a proxy for bad experience, the observed customer transactions in the telco data feed before the user places a call to a customer care center. We evaluate our approach using a rich dataset provided by a major African telecommunication's company and a novel big data architecture for both the training and scoring of predictive models. Our empirical study shows our solution to be effective at predicting user experience by inferring if a customer will place a call based on his current context. These promising results open new possibilities for improved customer service, which will help telcos to reduce churn rates and improve customer experience, both factors that directly impact their revenue growth.",,978-1-4799-9926-2,10.1109/BigData.2015.7363860,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363860,Telecom operators;Customer Care;Big Data;Predictive Analytics,Mobile communication;Real-time systems;Feeds;Predictive models;Context;Big data,,19.0,,23.0,IEEE,28 Dec 2015,29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2015,29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2015,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Ensuring their integrity is challenging because existing blockchain-assisted auditing schemes are primarily optimized for static or periodically updated data and provide limited support for continuous ingestion, real-time verification, and auditor access control. These limitations lead to high recomputation overhead, delayed tamper detection, and the lack of reusable proofs required for scalable log publishing.This paper introduces a verifiable log publishing framework based on a newly proposed ancestor-assisted Merkle Tree with stride-based checkpoints for efficient verification of encrypted logs. Each log record is canonically formatted, AEAD-encrypted with metadata binding, and producer-attested prior to storage. Parent-node records and ancestor certificates are distributed via a private Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to enable proof reuse, while only an epoch-level root-of-roots is anchored on a public blockchain to provide tamper-evident integrity guarantees. The framework further supports auditor authorization using certification-authority-issued tokens and incorporates micro-root commitments for near real-time verification. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements: single-record verification is significantly faster than the strongest baseline, verification throughput is markedly higher, commit latency is greatly reduced, and on-chain storage remains constant across all evaluated epoch sizes. These results confirm that the proposed architecture enables scalable, low-latency, and compliance-aware log integrity verification suitable for modern cloud data lake environments.",2644-1268,,10.1109/OJCS.2026.3663463,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11389188,Blockchain;Integrity;Data Lake;Merkle Tree;DHT;AEAD,Blockchains;Big Data applications;Trees (botanical);Cryptography;Real-time systems;Metadata;Cloud computing;Publishing;Databases;Semantics,,,,,CCBYNCND,10 Feb 2026,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

This paper addresses the problem of joinable tables discovery, which has many applications in scenarios such as augmenting training data, data cleaning, and extracting machine learning features. However, existing methods usually consider only one factor or assign equal weights to multiple factors in joinable tables discovery, resulting in low optimization precision and ignoring joinable tables discovery purpose. We propose GRMA, a joinable tables discovery method based on a grey relational model considering multiple factors. First, we select different factors according to the purpose of joinable tables discovery and calculate their scores for each table in the data lake. Then, we set weights for different factors using Analytic Hierarchy Process. Finally, we substitute the scores and weights into the grey relational analysis method to determine the final score and perform a top-k query. We also design a unique pruning method, screening pruning, for joinable tables discovery based on multi-factor problems and apply it to GRMA. Our experiments show that GRMA outperforms the best current joinable tables discovery methods by 28%, 13%, and 24% in precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively.",,979-8-3503-5337-2,10.1109/CBD63341.2023.00047,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration; Southeast University; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10516514,,Education;Training data;Machine learning;Analytic hierarchy process;Big Data applications;Feature extraction;Data models,,,,26.0,IEEE,8 May 2024,18-19 Dec. 2023,18-19 Dec. 2023,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

CrossEM: A Prompt Tuning Framework for Cross-Modal Entity Matching,Q. Yuan; Y. Yuan; Z. Wen; C. Chen; G.

Current EM assumes that these data are either homogeneous with aligned schema or heterogeneous but can be transformed into a unified modality. There is an urgent need to consider the entities with different modalities to support practical application scenarios over data lakes such as multi-modal data integration and recommendation system. It is impractical to unify their data modalities. To support EM on heterogeneous entity with different data formats and modalities, we propose cross-modal entity matching in this paper. Inspired by the promising performance achieved by recent pre-trained models, we perform cross-modal entity matching by prompt-tuning pre-trained multi-modal large models (MMLMs) in an unsupervised manner. However, the prompt-tuning faces three challenging issues: (i) objective gap between pre-training and tuning of MMLMs; (ii) data modality gap between the inputs of MMLMs and our matching task; (iii) prompt efficiency on large data. Therefore, we firstly propose a novel EM framework (namely, CrossEM) that addresses cross-modal EM as a matching probability problem with specific prompt-tuning. Secondly, two alternative prompt generation methods are designed to extract structural knowledge from heterogeneous data to overcome the data modality gap with pre-trained models. Thirdly, we present an improved matching framework (namely, CrossEM+) to boost the prompt efficiency on large heterogeneous data. Experimental evaluations verify that our methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmarks. Furthermore, our case study highlights the considerable potential of cross-modal EM in improving the performance of downstream tasks, thereby benefitting a wider range of research areas.",2375-026X,979-8-3315-3603-9,10.1109/ICDE65448.2025.00053,"National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB2702100); NSFC(grant numbers:61932004,62225203,U21A20516); NSFC(grant numbers:62472387); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2023M743403); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Major Program(grant numbers:LDQ24F02000); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11113143,data lake;cross-modal entity matching;prompt tuning,Training;Soft sensors;Scalability;Data integration;Data models;Data mining;Tuning;Recommender systems;Optimization;Faces,,1.0,,62.0,IEEE,20 Aug 2025,19-23 May 2025,19-23 May 2025,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

AI-Driven Zero-Trust Cloud Security: Automated Threat Response Leveraging Multi-Cloud Data Lakes and LLMS,S. Srivastava; R. Kohli,"Independent Researcher, Grand Prairie, TX, USA; Independent Researcher, Carmel, IN, USA",2025 20th International Joint Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (iSAI-NLP),12 Jan 2026,2025,,,1,6,"Zero-Trust architectures have become the foundation of modern enterprise security, requiring continuous authentication, least-privilege enforcement, and pervasive monitoring. However, as organizations increasingly adopt multi-cloud infrastructures, traditional Zero-Trust implementations struggle with scale, data silos, and evolving adversarial tactics. This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) can enhance Zero-Trust principles by automating threat detection and response across multi-cloud data lakes. We propose an integrated architecture where multi-modal telemetry feeds AI-driven analytics pipelines, producing explainable, automated security actions that reduce analyst fatigue while strengthening compliance. By leveraging LLMs for context enrichment and response orchestration, enterprises can operationalize Zero Trust at scale, aligning automation with trustworthiness. Case studies, experimental results, and analyst-centric explainability approaches demonstrate that AI-enhanced Zero-Trust is not only feasible but necessary for defending against increasingly sophisticated threats.",2831-4565,979-8-3315-0217-1,10.1109/iSAI-NLP66160.2025.11320545,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11320545,Zero-Trust;Multi-Cloud;Data Lakes;Threat Response;LLMs;Explainable AI;Automation;Cloud Security;SOC,Automation;Cloud computing security;Computer architecture;Organizations;Big Data applications;Threat assessment;Zero Trust;Telecommunications;Telemetry;Sustainable development,,,,16.0,IEEE,12 Jan 2026,12-14 Nov. 2025,12-14 Nov. 2025,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

When a network of CPS is subject to frequent changes, the semantic interoperability between the CPSs is of special interest in order to avoid manual, tedious, and error-prone information model alignments at runtime. Ontologies are a suitable technology to enable semantic interoperability, as they allow the building of information models that lank machine-readable meaning to information, thus enabling CPSs to mutually understand the shared information. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, we present an ontology building method that is tailored toward the needs of CPSs in the manufacturing domain. For this purpose, we introduce the requirements regarding this method and discuss related research concerning ontology building. The method itself is designed to begin with ontological requirements and to yield a formal ontology. As the reuse of ontologies and other information resources (IRs) is crucial to the success of ontology building projects, we put special emphasis on how to reuse IRs in the CPS domain. Second, we present a reusable set of ontology design patterns that have been developed with the aforementioned method in an industrial use case and illustrate their application in the considered industrial environment. The contribution of this article extends the method introduced, as a postconference paper, by a detailed industrial application. Note to Practitioners-With growing digitalization in industry, the exchange and use of manufacturing-related data are becoming increasingly important to improve, support, or automate processes. Thus, it is necessary to combine information from different data sources that have been designed by different vendors and may, therefore, be heterogeneous in structure and semantics. A system that plans a maintenance worker's daily schedule, for instance, requires information about the status of machines, production plans, and inventory, which resides in other systems, such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) or databases. When creating such information systems, accessing, searching, and understanding the different data sources is a time-intensive and error-prone procedure due to the heterogeneities of the data sources. Even worse, this procedure has to be repeated for every newly built system and for every newly introduced data source. To allow for eased access, searching, and understanding of these heterogeneous data sources, ontology can be used to integrate all heterogeneous data sources in one schema. This article contributes a method for building such ontologies in the manufacturing domain. Furthermore, a set of ontology design patterns is presented, which can be reused when building ontologies for a domain.",1558-3783,,10.1109/TASE.2020.2991777,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9097408,Cyber–physical systems (CPSs);manufacturing domain knowledge;ontology building;ontology;ontology-based data access (OBDA);semantic heterogeneity,Ontologies;Buildings;Semantics;Manufacturing;Unified modeling language;Interoperability;Task analysis,,88.0,,57.0,IEEE,20 May 2020,July 2020,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

As required data is often not available from centrally managed sources, the concept of data spaces has more and more frequently been utilized to integrate decentral data sources and supporting the access to these. However, decentrally organized data management leads to differences in data models, formats and technologies and the problem of matching data from different sources most often still requires significant manual work, either from the provider or the consumer of the data. Especially in research data spaces, properties of data sources are often dynamically modified or extended, and complex queries are formulated to access the data. In this paper, we present an architecture to approach this problem by automatically exploring the different data sources and searching for similar attributes. Matching attributes are then assembled to so-called vocabularies, that represent common concepts in the data space independently from their actual representations.

Fog Computing,A.

This chapter explains the concept of fog computing and the associated challenges and then discusses the different options to be taken into account when dealing with a data lake. The main origin of the volume paradox comes from the fact that every communicating object is speaking freely and directly to potentially the whole network.

High resolution data provided by technologies such as AMI meters create the opportunity to deliver new distribution network and customer analysis that were not possible previously; however, the delivery of these advanced analytics projects has been challenging. While the identification of advanced analytics use cases is generally agreed upon across utilities, execution of these services is typically delivered in a case-by-case basis depending on chosen vendors and ability to integrate the necessary systems and data.

By creating and leveraging a standardized analytical data model focused on delivery of advanced analytics services rather than the vendor's software and hardware needs, economies of scale are realized across large and small utilities, reducing costs and the barrier of entry into advanced analytics and data driven decision making.",2687-8860,978-1-6654-8561-6,10.1109/ISC255366.2022.9922563,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922563,data architecture;common data model;shared services;cloud;data modelling,Meters;Analytical models;Costs;Smart cities;Transportation;SCADA systems;Data models,,,,16.0,IEEE,26 Oct 2022,26-29 Sept. 2022,26-29 Sept. 2022,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

To ensure improvements in production line efficiency, Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics demand data transformations that include changing the format, structure, or values of the data stored in a data lake.

Cross-border e-commerce supply chain faces many challenges, such as global logistics complexity, demand fluctuation, data island and so on, because it involves complex links such as transnational logistics, multi-currency settlement and customs clearance. In order to solve these problems, an algorithm framework including data integration layer, algorithm core layer and application layer is constructed. The data integration layer builds a unified data lake based on Delta Lake to collect multi-source heterogeneous data, The core layer of the algorithm adopts hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) architecture, which covers markov decision processes modeling, dynamic constraint satisfaction optimization and real-time feedback control. The application layer realizes the integrated processing of streams and batches through Flink, and supports a variety of application scenarios. In the design of intelligent scheduling algorithm, LSTM-Transformer hybrid model is used for demand forecasting, logistics path optimization is realized by multi-objective function, and Q-learning algorithm is used for inventory scheduling. The key technologies of big data analysis include using Isolation Forest algorithm to build a dynamic threshold model for real-time anomaly detection, and using GraphSAGE technology for multimodal data fusion. The experiment uses Ali Tianchi cross-border e-commerce data set and related external data sources. The results show that this research method is superior to the traditional method in terms of demand forecasting accuracy, logistics optimization effect and anomaly detection accuracy, which significantly improves key indicators such as order fulfillment cycle, inventory turnover rate, logistics cost ratio and customer satisfaction, and hierarchical RL algorithm shows superior performance in solving large-scale complex problems.",,978-1-80705-020-7,10.1049/icp.2025.3137,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11238231,,,,,,,,11 Nov 2025,29-31 July 2025,29-31 July 2025,IET,IET Conferences

Numerous maritime surveillance systems nowadays rely on the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which is compulsory for vessels over 299 Gross Tones, for vessel tracking purposes. Ship AIS spoofing involves creating a nonexistent vessel or masquerading a vessel's true identity, resulting in hiding or transmitting false positional data, so that a vessel appears to behave legitimately, thus deceiving stakeholders and authorities.

Pixels: An Efficient Column Store for Cloud Data Lakes,H. Bian; A.

Meanwhile, the widespread column stores, such as Parquet, are applied in these data lakes to improve analytical performance. However, as these column stores were designed for on-premise HDFS, they often suffer from the high latency of COS and deliver sub-optimal query performance. We observe that by optimizing the storage layout and data access pattern, we can effectively hide and mitigate the high latency. In this paper, we present Pixels, a column store optimized for the cloud that solves the problem by (1) the workload-driven storage layout optimization within and across the row group boundaries; (2) the I/O scheduling concerning the optimized storage layout and the performance characteristics of COS. They collectively improve the analytical performance in a transparent way that does not affect data ingestion and query execution in data lakes. Evaluations show that Pixels outperforms the state-of-the-art column store on COS by more than one order of magnitude on real-world workload and by 1.93x on TPC-H.

One of the core challenges in data lakes is dataset discovery, which involves tasks such as finding related tables, domain discovery, and column clustering. In this paper, we focus on a popular approach for finding related tables in public or private data lakes, namely table search. Given the heterogeneity of the tables in a data lake, recent methods adopt table-representation learning and produce dense vector representations for every row, column, or even cell value. This enables advanced indexing techniques, such as HSNW, LSH, and DiskANN, which implement efficient data-structures to speed-up the core operation of approximate k-NN search in such vector spaces. However, while many indexing techniques have been employed so far, their practical value and effectiveness governed by the tradeoff of accuracy vs. performance have not been explored yet. In this paper, we aim at shedding light on this gap. We start with an overview of state-of-the-art techniques for table search in data lakes that are based on vector-search operations. Then, we present an in-depth analysis of the performances of the k-ANN indexes and techniques they adopt.

Data lakes support data dumping in their native format, which makes them suitable for real-time deployments such as IoD. However, parsing through these unstructured databases has its concerns, particularly data extraction. Existing works on image-based content extraction focus on complex geometric and matrix mathematical operations, which are expensive in terms of both computation and time. A straightforward and fast solution is necessary for overcoming such challenges. Toward this, we limit our operations to string comparisons between the user's request and tags in the data lake. In particular, we adopt a fuzzy-based approach as it is capable of efficiently handling spelling variations, out-of-order words, and partial matchings, compared to conventional string comparison methods. Through lab-scale experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of Fido with an almost 80 percent similarity ratio between the request and response images and processing time of 80 µs.

To achieve this goal, an analysis of the supervised and ensemble machine learning algorithms was made. The dataset was preprocessed for the experiment with SMOTE resampling and robust scaling techniques. The chosen methods were compared using different metrics: $F$1 score, AUC and time consumption for training and classification. As a result of a metrics comparison, it was found that multilayer perceptron (MLP) and boosting methods (Adaptive, Gradient, XGBoost) has the highest classification, but MLP outperforms boosting methods in terms of time consumption for classification.

With the increasing availability of many more pieces of information about each entity of interest, e.g., a customer, often from diverse sources (social-media, mobility, internet-of-things), fusing, visualizing and deriving insights from such data pose a number of challenges: First, disparate datasets often lack a natural join key. Next, datasets may describe measures at different levels of granularity, e.g., individual vs. aggregate data, and finally, different datasets may be derived from physically distinct populations. Moreover, once data has been fused, queries are often an inefficient and inaccurate mechanism to derive insight from high-dimensional data. In this paper we describe iFuse, a data-fusion based visual analytics platform for navigating a data lake to derive insights. We rely on Bayesian graphical models to provide useful rudder with which to fuse and analyze disparate islands of data in a systematic manner. Our platform allows for rich interactive visualizations, querying and keyword-based search within and across datasets or models, as well as intuitive visual interfaces for value-imputation or model-based predictions.

LIFTus: An Adaptive Multi-Aspect Column Representation Learning for Table Union Search,E. Qiu; J. Gao; Y. Tu; J.

Recent approaches to TUS mainly learn column representations for searching by introducing Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), especially on columns with linguistic data. However, a significant amount of non-linguistic data, notably represented by domain-specific strings and numerical data in the data lake, are still under-explored in the existing methods. To address this issue, we propose LIFTus, an adaptive multi-aspect column representation for table unionable search, where aspect refers to a concept more flexible than data types, so that a single column can exhibit multiple aspects simultaneously. LIFTus aims at combining different aspects of a column (including both linguistic and non-linguistic aspects) to promote the effectiveness and generalization of TUS in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, besides employing PLMs to extract the linguistic aspects from an individual column, LIFTus trains a pattern encoder to learn possible character-level sequential patterns for the column, and builds a number encoder to capture numerical aspects of the column, including the distribution and magnitude features. LIFTus further utilizes a hierarchical cross-attention aided by aspect-relevant statistics to combine these aspects adaptively in producing the final column representations, which are indexed by vector retrieval techniques to achieve efficient search. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LIFTus has outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness, and achieved much better generalization capability to support unseen data.",2375-026X,979-8-3315-3603-9,10.1109/ICDE65448.2025.00165,NSFC(grant numbers:62272008); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11113165,Table Union Search;Data Lake;Aspect;Non-Linguistic Column;Generalization,Representation learning;Adaptation models;Linguistics;Feature extraction;Big Data applications;Data engineering;Vectors;Data models;Numerical models;Data mining,,,,58.0,IEEE,20 Aug 2025,19-23 May 2025,19-23 May 2025,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Gen-T: Table Reclamation in Data Lakes,G. Fan; R. Shraga; R. J. Miller,"Northeastern University, Boston, United States; Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, United States; Northeastern University, Boston, United States",2024 IEEE 40th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),23 Jul 2024,2024,,,3532,3545,"We introduce the problem of Table Reclamation. Given a Source Table and a large table repository, reclamation finds a set of tables that, when integrated, reproduce the source table as closely as possible. Unlike query discovery problems like Query-by-Example or by-Target, Table Reclamation focuses on reclaiming the data in the Source Table as fully as possible using real tables that may be incomplete or inconsistent. To do this, we define a new measure of table similarity, called error-aware instance similarity, to measure how close a reclaimed table is to a Source Table, a measure grounded in instance similarity used in data exchange. Our search covers not only Select-project-join queries, but integration queries with unions, outerjoins, and the unary operators subsumption and complementation that have been shown to be important in data integration and fusion. Using reclamation, a data scientist can understand if any tables in a repository can be used to exactly reclaim a tuple in the Source. If not, one can understand if this is due to differences in values or to incompleteness in the data. Our solution, Gen-T, performs table discovery to retrieve a set of candidate tables from the table repository, filters these down to a set of originating tables, then integrates these tables to reclaim the Source as closely as possible. We show that our solution, while approximate, is accurate, efficient and scalable in the size of the table repository with experiments on real data lakes containing up to 15K tables, where the average number of tuples varies from small (web tables) to extremely large (open data tables) up to 1M tuples.",2375-026X,979-8-3503-1715-2,10.1109/ICDE60146.2024.00272,"NSF(grant numbers:IIS-2107248,IIS-1956096,IIS-2325632); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10597787,Data lakes;Table Discovery,Filters;Accuracy;Measurement uncertainty;Data integration;Big Data applications;Data engineering;Open data,,1.0,,88.0,IEEE,23 Jul 2024,13-16 May 2024,13-16 May 2024,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Approximation of the Objective Functional in a Partially Defined Optimization Problem,Y. Kalinin; N. Kuchuk; D.

To solve these tasks, client-server architectures, based on the database server, used to store the obtained data, as well as server-based data analyzers are taken advantage of. Due to the increasing complexity of tasks of diagnosing the state of complex technical systems, associated with the generation of higher volumes of data for assessing the current state of the diagnostic objects, the use of classical relational storage resulted in a significant increase in the requirements for cluster architectures. With the increasing use of technological solutions based on the “Big Data” architecture, there is a contradiction associated with the need to store large amounts of unstructured data for further structuring by methods of database schema development. The mission of Data Mining is the implementation of search operations applied to the laws of behavior and overall functioning of the system under study, consisting of numerical data. An obligatory condition that arises when using Data Mining methodologies is to interpret the resulting patterns formed as a consequence of determining the practical utility of the data. In this regard, there is a need to develop a method for optimizing large amounts of data, especially in partially defined tasks, allowing the distribution of the readings of the state of complex technical systems. Thus, the paper considers the problem of objective function approximation by the linear functional in a partially defined optimization problem, when the objective function is partially defined by comparing its values on some set of vectors from the acceptance region.

Devices communicate either directly or via gateways, with the structured data transmitted to a modular Data Collection Platform (DCP). The DCP validates and organizes the data for database integration, supporting dynamic adaptability to new device types and sensor inputs with minimal reconfiguration. Our experiments across domains such as environmental monitoring, industrial automation, automotive telematics, and smart home systems highlight the framework's ability to simplify data representation while maintaining consistency across platforms. By standardizing data formats, the framework enhances ease-of-use for analytics tools, enabling seamless interpretation and application of insights across diverse use cases.

The datasets contain important current and historical data, and many datasets may be related to a single subject. The ecosystem must support the ability to perform holistic analysis across datasets and must ensure data integrity and security. For the latter, it is essential to keep a record of the creation and operations performed on a Data Lake object. This type of record-keeping is called data provenance. Assured data provenance can help detect the creation, manipulation, and deletion of objects within the Data Lake Ecosystem. However, developing assured data provenance remains a critical issue. There are challenges in secure collection and storage, verifiability, and privacy of the provenance data. Hence, there is a need for guaranteeing the security and integrity of data provenance for a Data Lake Ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a trusted data provenance application for rotorcraft maintenance data based on blockchain technology. Blockchain-based data provenance facilitates recording and tracking by treating the data as relevant assets in a transactional network. We designed and implemented a proof-of-concept application to collect and verify Data Lake provenance by embedding the data provenance on a private blockchain platform. This application allows the replication of data provenance on every node of a trusted closed network, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. With the proposed blockchain model, data provenance for unique Data Lake objects can be stored securely and efficiently verified.

Delivering in right‐time requires a strategic calculus of what the customer expects and a behind‐the‐scenes balance among systems, resources, and goals. A typical configuration—embraced by a number of enterprise CDPs—supports a real‐time process for some streaming data, data change actions, and flows, while also having a data lake or lake house where data are located for refinement, processing, and storage. Many CDPs maintain a subset of customer data in a so‐called “hot store” or in‐memory database. This can be called the real‐time profile. The purpose of this real‐time profile is to make certain frequently used or high‐value data available.

Therefore, it makes sense to process captured data locally at IoT edge node to avoid latency. In Edge Computing, the Gateway stores data and perform computations along with traffic aggregation and routing. While Edge analytics allows pre-processing and filtering of the data closer to where it's being created but the data which falls within normal range can be stored in low cost IoT storage and abnormal readings will be sent to Data Lake or in-memory database. Edge Computing will boost traditional Cloud computing model with service nodes placed at the network edges.

Prognosis Smart System AI-based Applied to Equipment Health Monitoring in 4.0 Industry Scenario,A. Silva; G. F. M. Souza,University of São Paulo; University of São Paulo,2021 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS),22 Nov 2021,2021,,,1,6,"In the age of IIoT - Industrial Internet of Things, data lake, data mining, big data, and cloud computing, the smart manufacturing enables to make more informed decisions in real-time by using the database extracted from sensors in its equipment. During an operational campaign, the Health Monitoring System (HMS) also allows an understanding of how component degradation is affecting the performance of the equipment. Through a structure supported by AI, as data lake and cloud computing, the HMS provides to monitored equipment a fault detection system, early warning alarms to prevent failures and a calculation of the remaining useful life (RUL).The purpose of this paper is to present a prognosis smart system based on AI applied to HMS to support decision-making regarding operational performance of equipment. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) procedure is developed to continuously analyze the mass of monitoring data generated during the machine operation. The ability to learn the behavior patterns of the collected signals and in this way to be able to make parameter predictions with high accuracy makes artificial neural networks a powerful tool to carry out an effective prognosis. Machine operational parameters are monitored simultaneously by the prognosis smart system. Then, this information is processed by the neural network and used to characterize the machine operational condition. Upon detecting a failure trend for one or more parameters monitored by recognizing deterioration patterns, the prognosis system calculates the remaining useful life (RUL) and allows maintainers to take early actions before the failure occurrence.The proposed methodology is applied as part of a HMS of a hydro generator based on parameters registered in operator inspections routes designed to identify critical equipment degradation. The registered data representing one operational year are used to train the neural network regarding normal and abnormal machine condition. After training, the neural network is able to predict failure trends for monitored temperature parameters of the hydro-generator lubricating system that is critical to support equipment performance. Comparing prediction data and data collected by the sensors, the developed neural network reached about 0,98 RMSE score. The remaining useful life prognosis proved to be an important tool to avoid hydro generator components unexpected failures which may affect power output and cause penalties to the power generation company.",2577-0993,978-1-7281-8017-5,10.1109/RAMS48097.2021.9605722,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9605722,artificial intelligence;health monitoring;smart prognosis;remaining useful life,Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Degradation;Recurrent neural networks;Neural networks;Tools;Market research,,2.0,,15.0,IEEE,22 Nov 2021,24-27 May 2021,24-27 May 2021,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Flights recurrently deviate from their scheduled time of arrival, which has negative downstream consequences that affect the efficiency of operations. Therefore, accurate and up-to-date ETA estimations prior to its landing can help in optimizing the actions to be taken by the different air transportation agents whenever schedule deviations are incurred, and thus reduce the economic, logistic and environmental impact that they cause. This presentation exposes an infrastructure for high-fidelity computation of accurate ETA in real-time, based on a data-driven approach that leverages the use of recorded aircraft trajectories. This infrastructure is composed of different elements: (1) a live ADS-B tracks gathering system embedded in a lambda-architecture cluster, with capabilities for real-time distribution and data lake storage (2) an ETA prediction machine learning model, employing the actual 4D aircraft position as input; and (3) a hybrid cloud architecture to support real-time visualization and distributions of ETA predictions. The proposed infrastructure has been successfully validated in a real environment (Transforming Transport, an European Commission funded project). This infrastructure enables real-time computation and distribution of accurate ETA for any arrival operation of interest. Results supported the envisioned benefits of getting such accurate ETA, which basically turn into a reduction of associated costs for airport authorities and airlines.",,978-1-7281-3421-5,10.1109/SEAA.2019.00035,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906713,machine learning;big data;real-time;visualization,Surveillance;Atmospheric modeling;Predictive models;Data visualization;Biological system modeling;Machine learning;Real-time systems,,6.0,,12.0,IEEE,21 Nov 2019,28-30 Aug. 2019,28-30 Aug. 2019,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Medical image processing based on deep learning has achieved significant success. However, the data belongs to the patient's privacy; therefore, the medical institutions as data custodians have the responsibility to protect the security of their data privacy. This situation makes medical institutions face a dilemma when building data-driven deep learning-assisted medical diagnosis methods. On the one hand, they need to pursue more high-quality data based on Big Data architecture for deep learning; on the other hand, they need to protect patient privacy to avoid data leakage. In response to the above challenges, we propose a hierarchical hybrid automatic segmentation model for pulmonary blood vessels based on local learning and federated learning approaches for segmenting the pulmonary blood vessels.

Decarbonizing the Aerospace Scope 3 emissions with efficient data monitoring framework,P. Durai; J. Nalavade,"Liverpool John Moores University, England; upGrad Education Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, (India)",2023 16th International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering (DeSE),21 Mar 2024,2023,,,534,539,"Aerospace is one of the most difficult industries to decarbonize, contributing 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. Achieving climate-neutral operations is a common challenge faced due to principal factors such as scale, expenses, and legal hurdles of placing innovative technology in the air. Jet fuel is a cost-effective technology; however, a major drawback is the enormous amounts of carbon released from the fuel. It can be appreciated that calculating and then eliminating Scope 3 emissions is an arduous concept since it accounts for a larger amount of carbon footprint for most aerospace industries. In terms of the volume of Scope 3 emissions, there is a rising urgency to cut them and transition to more sustainable methods of flying.To support the Paris Agreement various research and studies have been conducted to discover the causes of Scope 3 emissions and to minimize the impact that is bringing to this environment, but there is no clear industry-wide framework for tracking Aerospace Scope 3 emissions overall. The aim of this research is to develop a single data monitoring framework to gather and make use of data from diverse streams of aircraft operations. The primary objective of our study is to choose the appropriate datasets for the various Scope 3 emissions from airplanes and include those datasets into our proposed methodology to create informative results and seek to minimize GHG emissions in the environment.We employ big data analytical technologies to accomplish the study objectives. Our model is created in such a way that allows it to adjust for both batch and real-time inputs. The paper also discusses the data architecture and evaluation metrics used to assess the effectiveness of the framework. Aerospace companies can use this framework to monitor and manage their emissions, set targets, and develop strategies to reduce their carbon footprint. The results show that the framework can provide valuable insights into emissions data and help stakeholders make informed decisions to reduce their environmental impact.",,979-8-3503-8134-4,10.1109/DeSE60595.2023.10469041,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10469041,Sustainable Aviation;Scope 3 Emissions;Data Monitoring Framework;Aerospace;Carbon footprint;Climate Change;Carbon-Neutral;Big Data Analytics,Measurement;Reliability engineering;Real-time systems;Fuels;Stakeholders;Aerospace industry;Monitoring,,,,14.0,IEEE,21 Mar 2024,18-20 Dec. 2023,18-20 Dec. 2023,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Thirdly, we propose to approach the data partitioning problem fundamentally differently than the current default in most data lakes where partitioning is in the form of ingestion batches. We propose access pattern aware data partitioning and formulate an optimization problem that optimizes the size and reading costs of partitions subject to access patterns.We study the various optimization problems theoretically as well as empirically, and provide theoretical bounds as well as hardness results.

However, the existing evolutionary algorithms for CND only focus on independent nodes, ignoring the underlying relationship among the nodes.

However, numerous studies reveal that it is susceptible to spoofing attacks where a third person might freely synthesize counterfeit fingerprints to trick the scanner. To resist spoofing attacks, it makes fingerprint liveness detection (FLD) highly desirable. Most of previous work was to directly input the whole fingerprints into convolutional neural network, making it impossible to fully explore the relationship of spatial ridges, especially those with the latent fine-grained minutia on fingerprint ridges. Accordingly, in this paper, we exploit the relationship of spatial ridges in fingerprints and propose a novel FLD method based on spatial ridges continuity (FLD-SRC). Several fingerprint patches are first selected utilizing ridge texture saturation, and then uniformly split into several slices and thus construct the spatial continuity between pixels and between slices. Next, the proposed FLD-SRC learns deep features from fingerprints and eliminates redundant information. After that, the extracted feature maps are treated as a sequence and analyzed the intra-continuity by cascade gated recurrent unit (GRU). A discriminant slice grouping subnetwork is then developed to model the correlation between ridges slices and implicitly discover the discriminant inter-continuity. Pruning strategy is further utilized to reduce network parameters and promote its practical application in real scenarios. Experimental results, evaluated on three publicly available datasets, show the competitiveness of our method.

In an IoT-enabled Industry 4.0 environment, this approach can be taken to a new level by leveraging the vast amounts of data generated by connected devices. To implement a machine learning methodology to projecting conservation in an Industry 4.0 environment, several key steps need to be taken. First, data from IoT devices across the industrial ecosystem should be collected and centralized in a data lake or similar storage system. This data should include information on equipment health, sensor readings, and other relevant metrics. Next, the data should be preprocessed and transformed to ensure its quality and consistency. This may involve cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to create relevant variables for use in machine learning models. Once the data has been preprocessed, a range of machine learning models can be trained on it to predict equipment failures or other maintenance issues. This may involve ongoing tuning and optimization of model hyperparameters or retraining the models on new data as it becomes available. Finally, the predictions generated by the machine learning models should be integrated into a broader maintenance management system to enable timely action. This may include triggering maintenance requests, generating work orders, or even automating maintenance tasks through the use of robots or other industrial automation technologies.

In particular, the free-floating paradigm lets the customers look for available cars, book one, and then start and stop the rental at their will, within a specific area. This is done thanks to a smartphone app, which contacts a web-based backend to exchange information. In this paper we present UMAP, a platform to harvest the data freely made available on the web by these backends and to extract driving habits in cities. We design UMAP with two specific purposes. Firsty UMAP fetches data from car sharing platforms in real time. Secondly, it processes the data to extract advanced information about driving patterns and user's habits. To extract information, UMAP augments the data available from the car sharing platforms with mapping and direction information fetched from other web platforms. This information is stored in a data lake where historical series are built, and later analyzed using analytics modules easy to design and customize. We prove the flexibility of UMAP by presenting a case of study for the city of Turin. We collect car sharing usage data for over 50 days to characterize both the temporal and spatial properties of rentals, and to characterize customers' habits in using the service, which we contrast with public transportation alternatives.

The mass availability of these technologies has resulted in an exponential increase in the quantity of generated data. Together with the simultaneous exponential growth in computing power, this has driven rapid advances in the application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). These developments in the fields of data availability and AI technologies present even greater challenges for law enforcement and policing, while simultaneously opening huge opportunities. Complementing the benefits of these technologies by the law enforcement authorities, criminals are also equally exploiting technology. A part of the digital world is the increasing abundance of digital evidence; from CCTV footage to emails to phone records, evidence has now gone digital and there is a requirement to ensure it is accessible, readable, and has long‐term integrity when current technology, systems, or formats have been replaced or decommissioned. There is a further requirement for a seamless interface between policing and the criminal justice system to ensure digital evidence can be presented easily and without delay. As the quantity of data being used in criminal investigations becomes increasing larger, there is a critical need to maintain records tracing the origin and processing of evidence collected in digital format to authenticate the validity of the evidence. Addressing this need, the multimedia analysis and correlation engine for organized crime prevention and investigation (MAGNETO) project proposed the use of blockchain technologies for tracking and recording the processing of information within the big‐data architecture of the criminal investigation platform. The novelty of the proposed framework relies on the use of semantic technologies for knowledge formalization and the use of immutable technology based on hashing solutions to prevent evidentiary modifications.

For large group enterprises like telecom operators, it is not simple to manage the massive data scattered in different departments, different facilities, different regions, and different systems. This paper creatively proposes a distributed data fabric architecture based on metadate knowledge graph to solve this problem. The functional architecture consists of six layers, including acquisition storage layer, data management layer, knowledge graph layer, data directory layer, model application layer, user request layer, etc. A feasible framework is designed to guide how to implement this architecture, and several key enabling technologies have been studied. Instead of storing the full amount of data in a centralized data lake, we choose to centralize the metadata into the data warehouse. This can avoid the problems of data privacy disclosure, long data turnover time, wrong data entry into the lake and high operation and maintenance cost. Specifically, the enhanced data knowledge directory derived from the lower-level global metadata knowledge map is constructed, including static data resource directory, static business resource directory, and dynamic enhanced knowledge directory automatically generated based on user input.

Among the several possibilities, data mesh, a distributed data architecture that is organized around specific domains and provides a self-service platform for accessing and using the data, is gaining the attention of the data and software engineering communities, mainly because of its ability to reduce the tension between the platform that manages the data and the teams that are in charge of managing them. Nevertheless, data mesh mainly focuses on how to manage data in a single organization by defining the sphere of responsibilities in the data management. Conversely, the continuous increase of data produced by hospitals calls for new approaches that enable the data sharing between clinical research centers.Goal of this paper is to extend the data mesh approach by considering the sharing of data among organizations which are members of a federation. Under the umbrella of a clinical trial which defines a temporary agreement among hospitals, a federated data mesh solution is designed to support the data management when data products from different organizations are considered.

Cache nodes placed close to end users can manage access contents and adapt them to users' devices, while reducing video traffic in the core. By adopting the recently standardized MPEG-DASH technique, video contents can be delivered over HTTP, so HTTP servers can be used to serve contents, while packagers running as software can prepare live contents. This paves the way for virtualizing the CDN function. In this talk, a CDN manager is proposed to adapt the virtualized CDN function to current and future demand. A Big Data architecture, fulfilling the ETSI NFV guidelines, allows controlling virtualized components while collecting and pre-processing data. Re-optimization problems minimizing CDN costs while ensuring the highest quality are triggered based on threshold violations; data stream mining sketches transform collected into modelled data and statistical linear regression and machine learning techniques are proposed to produce estimation of future scenarios. Exhaustive simulation over a realistic scenario reveal remarkable costs reduction by dynamically reconfiguring the CDN.

All this data must be processed by more and more complex Big Data applications that gather and provide most useful information out of it. Consequently, the storage systems have evolved to keep up with all these changes, transitioning from traditional Data warehouses to Data Lakes and now to Lakehouses. All these applications consist of various transformations on stored data that result in another improved version of it, enriched with some new knowledge that brings value to the user. Based on the type of transformation, one can distinguish at least two types. The first can be simply executed on demand at runtime to get some insights from the collected data, such as the events count or some aggregated reports. The other type is more complex by its nature because it involves some complex processing of that data solely or in conjunction with other data. So, the result of such a transformation is both expensive and not feasible to be computed at runtime every time it is needed. Therefore, it must be persisted on storage once it is computed and then, kept up to date with the latest changes. This persisted computed version of the data is named materialized view, and multiple materialized views can be chained in data pipelines if the result of one transformation represents the input of the next one. Replication is the mechanism that adds lineage semantics to the materialized view transformation, independent of how many chained materialized views are kept, such as in the case of the bronzesilver-gold tables in the medallion architecture. Furthermore, this identifiability feature added to the materialized data facilitates both the propagation of all new incoming changes and the at-least-once processing semantics of the system in case of data reprocessing or in the case this reprocessing is the actual purpose of the service. The proposed replication solution consists of two types of system generated ids, one that uniquely identifies a unit of data and one that points to the original unit of data representing its source.",2768-7295,979-8-3503-6813-0,10.1109/INISTA62901.2024.10683854,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10683854,Big Data;Replication;Lakehouse;Materialized View;Machine Learning,Technological innovation;Runtime;Soft sensors;Pipelines;Semantics;Computer architecture;Big Data applications,,,,12.0,IEEE,24 Sep 2024,4-6 Sept. 2024,4-6 Sept. 2024,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems.

This study investigates the transformative potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation integrated with Large Language Models (RAG-LLM) in public service innovation through architectural analysis and cross-national case studies of Estonia, Singapore, and the European Union. By examining RAG-LLM implementations across legal, administrative, and multilingual domains, the research identifies critical success factors in governance models, interoperability frameworks, and data standardization.Key findings reveal that centralized architectures (Estonia’s Kratt ecosystem, Singapore’s AIBots) enable rapid scaling through unified standards, while federated models (EU’s cross-border system) balance sovereignty with collaboration. Hybrid retrieval strategies-combining keyword-based and semantic search-and domain-specific embeddings reduce hallucinations by up to 63%, ensuring compliance and accuracy in high-stakes scenarios. Operational efficiencies are significant: Estonia processes 1.2M monthly queries with 89% resolution rates, Singapore automates 40% more citizen inquiries, and the EU reduces permit processing from six weeks to three days. Citizen satisfaction rates (82–98%) correlate with transparency features (source citations, multilingual support) and inclusive design.The study underscores that RAG-LLM systems act as force multipliers for public sector innovation when supported by adaptive governance, continuous data quality management, and standardized evaluation metrics.
